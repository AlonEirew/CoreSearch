QUERY_ANSWERS={'massive flood', 'Johnstown Flood of 1977', '1977 flood'}
QUERY_CONTEXT=The flood was preceded by rains from March 9 that did not stop until March 22 , 1936 . The storms brought warmer 50 °F ( 10 °C ) weather that was a cause of one stage of flooding and the continuous rains a second cause of flooding . The natural run-off of 1 to 3 inches ( 2.5 to 7.5 cm ) was far surpassed by the deluge of from 10 to 30 inches ( 25 to 75 cm ) of water in the region . The flood came before pending flood control legislation was enacted or any significant flood control measures implemented . The narrowness of the valleys and encroachment of buildings on the river banks contributed to record flooding . By the time nightfall came one-third of the city was under of water and by the time flooding was over twenty-five people lost their lives . The damages , estimated at $ 43 million , made it the worst flood since the flood of 1889 and the event is chronicled at the Johnstown Flood Museum After the flood , sweeping nationwide flood control laws were enacted and from 1938 to 1943 Johnstown saw many projects completed . These measures gave the people the feeling that the area was now " flood free " , and it was touted as such until the flood of 1977

QUERY_ANSWERS={'2004 Academy Awards', 'Academy Awards', '76th Academy Awards', "previous year 's ceremony", '76th ceremony'}
QUERY_CONTEXT=In the 1959 review for '' Sight & Sound '' , David Vaughan calls '' Gigi '' " an elegant film " with a " cultivated visual taste which is everywhere apparent " . He summarises that " while '' Gigi '' does not represent a revival of the MGM musical in its heyday , it is a welcome extension of latter-day musical style in its adult subject-matter and its avoidance of spectacle made vulgar by emphasis on size . " He praises Minnelli 's talent for " the delicious amorality of the anecdote , but also the honesty and irony of its telling which have become foreign to the American cinema . " Vaughan points out " Chevalier 's practiced but irresistible charm as one of the film 's greatest assets " as well as " the brilliant high-comedy playing of Isabel Jeans , who as Aunt Alicia consummately portrays the distinction and beauty of a retired aristocrat of the '' demimonde '' . " Bosley Crowther of '' The New York Times '' called it " a musical film that bears such a basic resemblance to '' My Fair Lady '' that the authors may want to sue themselves " . He added , " But do n't think this point of resemblance is made in criticism of the film , for '' Gigi '' is a charming entertainment that can stand on its own two legs . It is not only a charming comprehension of the spicy confection of Colette , but it is also a lovely and lyrical enlargement upon that story 's flavored mood and atmosphere … Vincente Minnelli has marshaled a cast to give a set of performances that , for quality and harmony , are superb . " Abel Green of '' Variety '' called the film " 100 % escapist fare " and predicted it " is destined for a global box-office mop-up " . He added , " Alan Jay Lerner 's libretto is tailor-made for an inspired casting job for all principals , and Fritz Loewe 's tunes ( to Lerner 's lyrics ) already vie with and suggest their memorable '' My Fair Lady '' score … Miss Caron is completely captivating and convincing in the title role … Skillful casting , performance and presentation have endowed realism to the sum total … Director Minnelli 's good taste in keeping it in bounds and the general sound judgment of all concerned … distinguishes this Arthur Freed independent production . The Metrocolor rates recognition for its soft pastels under Joseph Ruttenberg 's lensing ; the Beaton costumes , sets and general production design are vivid physical assets at first sight . The skillful integration of words-and-music with the plot motivation makes this '' Gigi '' a very fair lady indeed as a boxoffice entry . " '' Time Out New York '' said , " The dominating creative contribution comes from Minnelli and Cecil Beaton … The combination of these two visual elitists is really too much — it 's like a meal consisting of cheesecake , and one quickly longs for something solid and vulgar to weigh things down . No doubt inspired by the finicky , claustrophobic sets and bric-à-brac , the cast tries ( with unfortunate success ) to be more French than the French , especially Chevalier . The exception is Gingold , who inhabits , as always , a world of her own . " '' TV Guide '' rated the film 3 ½ out of five stars , calling it " Overbaked but enjoyable , and a banquet for the eyes , thanks to the visual wonder of the Minnelli-Beaton teaming … Caron … leads the cast in a contest to see who can be the most French . The winner is Chevalier , in a performance that makes one feel as if you 're gagging on pastry … Perhaps if the sweetness of '' Gigi '' was contrasted with elements of honest vulgarity , the picture could balance itself out … Ten minutes into the movie , you 've resolved the plot and are left to wallow in lovely frou-frou . The film makes wonderful use of the usual Parisian landmarks , and benefits from extraordinary period costumes and sets .

		CONTEXT=Critical opinion regarding the film has been overwhelmingly positive . '' The Village Voice '' critic J. Hoberman , who in 1981 included the film in his list of the ten best films commercially released in the United States during that year , more recently wrote that the film is one " of the richest avant-garde features of the 1970s " and praised its " winning combination of sexual frankness and visual wit , " while another critic , Dennis Schwartz , wrote that the " film 's beauty is derived from its sexual frankness and playfully drawn out intimate relationship scenes , witty use of photography , and its originality as it breaks free of conventional unities of body , space and time . Export skillfully edits montage and integrates video , still photography , and performance art with elements from Cubism , Surrealism , Dada and avant-garde cinema . " '' Artforum '' noted in November 1980 that " w atching their scenes together , we realize how seldom , if ever before , the details of sexual intimacy have been shown in film from the point of view from a woman . Export privileges rupture over unity and never settles for one-dimensional solutions " and it was called one " of the most original films in this year 's exposition " and a " tour de force of cinematic invention " grounded in the director 's " fresh and intelligent sensibility , characteristically self-referential . Her visual resources include mirrors , still photography , video , dance , and films within the film , all employed with a bold and surprising inventiveness " by the catalogue notes of the 1978 Los Angeles International Film Exposition . Similarly , critic Alison Butler wrote that the " film is a witty and visually brilliant essay on gender and experience , culture and environment " and program notes used by the San Francisco Cinematheque during a screening quote critic Amy Taubin as opining that the film " makes you reconsider what you and everyone else is doing — in life and in art " and critic Steve Anker underscoring that it is an important " crossover film " combining " avant-garde and theatrical sensibilities , made during the mid-1970s . It chronicles the nightmarish breakdown of a fashion photographer as she confronts her waning identity and security as a career woman ; blending narrative experimentation , fantasy , fact and theoretical critique , it has enormous impact on independent features which followed it . " PopMatters noted that the film has " enough originality to nag at patient viewers and get at least partially under our skin " and critic Michael Atkinson wrote that it is a " weird , restless , beguilingly offbeat bit of dreamwork . " The film was presented for the first time at the Berlin International Film Festival in 1977 , it has won a Special Jury Prize at the Venice Film Festival and was recently called " seminal " during a screening at a repertory cinema , " a strong and humoristic showdown " at another and " a sonically-complex , montage-rich , darkly funny and uriniferous cornerstone of avant-garde cinema " during a screening at a New York University class . Critic Peter Hajek wrote in the Austrian newspaper '' Kurier '' that " Valie Export presents this psychopanoptic view of the present in solid , striking images and often in unexpected humorous passages . " Critic Chris Holmlund , author of the scholarly article " Feminist Makeovers : The Celluloid Surgery of Valie Export and Su Friedrich , " referred to '' Invisible Adversaries '' as a feminist version of '' Invasion of the Body Snatchers '' , noted that the film includes references to famous paintings and to '' Un Chien Andalou '' , and wrote that therefore it " is visually rick , entertaining , striking , but also demanding . " A few reviews , however , were negative . For example , London 's '' Time Out '' wrote about the film that it is " n ot unlike '' W.R. : Mysteries of the Organism '' " and that it will " probably age as badly " and a reviewer for '' The Heights '' wrote that " I was expecting a great feminist work here , but got mediocrity . I can not recommend that you see this film , " though he nevertheless praised the film as a " cornucopia of video spectacle in which Export delights , confounds and amuses the audience with her antics .

		CONTEXT=, the film holds a rating of 75 % on Rotten Tomatoes based on 28 reviews , with an average rating of 6.47 / 10 . The website 's critical consensus reads : " Abel Ferrara 's 1995 horror/suspense experiment blends urban vampire adventure with philosophical analysis to create a smart , idiosyncratic and undeniably odd take on the genre . " Kevin Thomas of the '' Los Angeles Times '' praised Taylor 's performance , and added : " Although Ferrara dares to be intellectual in a manner virtually unique in commercial American cinema , he nevertheless does n't forget how to entertain in the gory , bravura manner associated with him . Although it undeniably helps , you do n't have to know your Heidegger from Hamburger Helper to enjoy '' The Addiction '' as a grisly yet unusual thriller of the supernatural . " '' The Washington Post '' s Hal Hinson was less laudatory of Taylor 's performance , writing that she " seems less distinctive here than she has been in past roles . " However , he praised Walken 's performance , though summarized the film as " serious and passionate ; Ferrara 's conviction , too , is unquestionable . However , when he flashes images of historic atrocities of both the distant and recent past — Nazi death camps , the war dead in Bosnia — his ideas come across as shallow and banal . Also , inserting scenes of real-life horror into what is essentially a glorified genre exercise may strike some as the essence of bad taste . " Caryn James of '' The New York Times '' expressed a similar sentiment , noting " When the film connects Kathleen 's struggle to resist evil to My Lai and the Holocaust , those comparisons are exploitative in a way that even a genre-bending film ca n't get away with . " Stephen Hunter of '' The Baltimore Sun '' praised Taylor for portraying Kathleen " with dour , sexless intensity , " and deemed the film " far sexier than '' Interview with the Vampire '' and far deadlier than the campy '' Nadja '' ... It 's extremely disturbing , a graduate - level movie for advanced students in either of three subjects : cinema , philosophy and debauchery . " The film was nominated for the Golden Bear award at the 45th Berlin International Film Festival where it won the Blue Angel Award . Lili Taylor won the Sant Jordi Award for Best Foreign Actress . The film received Best Actress ( Taylor ) , Best Film ( Abel Ferrara ) and Special Mention Award ( Walken ) at the Málaga International Week of Fantastic Cinema .

		CONTEXT=, the film holds a rating of 75 % on Rotten Tomatoes based on 28 reviews , with an average rating of 6.47 / 10 . The website 's critical consensus reads : " Abel Ferrara 's 1995 horror/suspense experiment blends urban vampire adventure with philosophical analysis to create a smart , idiosyncratic and undeniably odd take on the genre . " Kevin Thomas of the '' Los Angeles Times '' praised Taylor 's performance , and added : " Although Ferrara dares to be intellectual in a manner virtually unique in commercial American cinema , he nevertheless does n't forget how to entertain in the gory , bravura manner associated with him . Although it undeniably helps , you do n't have to know your Heidegger from Hamburger Helper to enjoy '' The Addiction '' as a grisly yet unusual thriller of the supernatural . " '' The Washington Post '' s Hal Hinson was less laudatory of Taylor 's performance , writing that she " seems less distinctive here than she has been in past roles . " However , he praised Walken 's performance , though summarized the film as " serious and passionate ; Ferrara 's conviction , too , is unquestionable . However , when he flashes images of historic atrocities of both the distant and recent past — Nazi death camps , the war dead in Bosnia — his ideas come across as shallow and banal . Also , inserting scenes of real-life horror into what is essentially a glorified genre exercise may strike some as the essence of bad taste . " Caryn James of '' The New York Times '' expressed a similar sentiment , noting " When the film connects Kathleen 's struggle to resist evil to My Lai and the Holocaust , those comparisons are exploitative in a way that even a genre-bending film ca n't get away with . " Stephen Hunter of '' The Baltimore Sun '' praised Taylor for portraying Kathleen " with dour , sexless intensity , " and deemed the film " far sexier than '' Interview with the Vampire '' and far deadlier than the campy '' Nadja '' ... It 's extremely disturbing , a graduate - level movie for advanced students in either of three subjects : cinema , philosophy and debauchery . " The film was nominated for the Golden Bear award at the 45th Berlin International Film Festival where it won the Blue Angel Award . Lili Taylor won the Sant Jordi Award for Best Foreign Actress . The film received Best Actress ( Taylor ) , Best Film ( Abel Ferrara ) and Special Mention Award ( Walken ) at the Málaga International Week of Fantastic Cinema . The film was nominated for two Independent Spirit Awards and won Critics Award in Mystfest and was also nominated for Best Film .

		CONTEXT=The jazz orchestra dancing in Scandinavia was interrupted by the counterculture of the 1960s , whose influences of left-wing politics and LSD were altering the shape of popular music around the world . In 1967 the first psychedelic and progressive rock groups emerged in Stockholm 's Filips club , including Hansson & Karlsson , the Baby Grandmothers , and Mecki Mark Men . These groups were very popular in the Sweden of the late 60s , with television appearances , sold-out concerts , and tours around Europe . Mecki Mark Men even spent three months in the U.S. where they played big rock music festivals with Sly and the Family Stone , Jethro Tull , Pentangle , Mountain , Grand Funk Railroad , Paul Butterfield , and The Byrds . Aside from this music that blended rock , jazz , and folk music with improvisation and experimentation , Swedish progressive rock , or " progg " as it became known , was also fiercely political . Progg bands would go on to support efforts against war and nuclear power , or protest competitive events like Eurovision , stating , " Music can not be a contest . " The term " dansband " was coined around 1970 , when Swedish popular music developed a signature style with brightly characterized lyrics and catchy melodies . The following decade became the golden era of dansband music , with groups like Thorleifs , Flamingokvintetten , Ingmar Nordströms , Wizex and Matz Bladhs rising to popularity in Sweden . In 1977 , the song " Beatles " , performed by Swedish dansband Forbes , won the Swedish Melodifestivalen 1977 and finished 18th ( last ) in the Eurovision Song Contest 1977

		CONTEXT=From 2016 onwards , Y NOT Studios continued to contribute towards making " new wave films " in the Tamil film industry and experienced commercial success . The company collaborated with director Sudha Kongara , actor Madhavan , and debutante actress Ritika Singh to produce a bilingual sports drama film titled '' Irudhi Suttru '' ( 2016 ) in Tamil and '' Saala Khadoos '' ( 2016 ) in Hindi , which told the story of a boorish boxing coach taking on a rebellious young woman from a fishermen colony as his new student . With a publicity budget of 9 crore rupees , the promotions for the films were described by The Hindu to be " unlike other film promotions in the South " , considering that most film teams in the Tamil film industry do not usually tour around the state publicising their project . Before the release of the film , the team held several screenings to select Hindi and Tamil audiences and edited the film accordingly to the taste of the audiences . '' Irudhi Suttru '' opened to positive reviews , with a critic from Sify.com stating that the film was " a perfect sports drama , which should not be missed " and added that " this inspirational effort has a superb screenplay with all the typical elements of a good sports film in place " , while Rediff.com agreed that the film was " not to be missed " , adding " its refreshing characters , enjoyable plot , great music and visuals keeps you hooked " . Following the success of the film , Sudha Kongara remade the film in the Telugu language as '' Guru '' ( 2017 ) with Venkatesh in the lead role alongside Ritika Singh . '' Irudhi Suttru '' was later screened at the 29th Tokyo International Film Festival during October 2016 and was then also selected to be a part of the Indian Panorama section at 47th International Film Festival of India . It went on to win a National Film Award for Ritika Singh ; three Filmfare Awards for Best Director , Actor and Actress ; as well as Best Picture at the South Indian International Movie Awards and the IIFA Utsavam

People have to know the film is out there , that it wants to be seen . And that 's exponentially more difficult for an independent film without big stars , huge billboards and full support from the major TV networks . '' " Alido and his Digitank Studios staff proceeded to do everything they could to promote the film , lugging promotional material and viewing equipment to different SM branches and eventually getting the film played in twelve SM Cinema Branches beginning March 9 , while a nonconventional promotional campaign used Facebook and YouTube to build hype for the film , often taking advantage of the fact that the prequel short film , " Faculty " , had become a viral favorite on social networking sites . As of the day before the regular screening , the campaign had attracted more than twelve thousand to the movie 's official Facebook page . The film was first screened as an independent film during the 2010 Metro Manila Film Festival , which began a special category for indie films that year

In previous years , countries that received a top 10 placing were automatically granted a spot in the next year 's final without having to compete in a semi-final , but for 2008 , the EBU changed the automatic qualification regulations so that all countries except the " Big 4 " ( France , Germany , Spain , and the United Kingdom ) and host country , would have to pass through one of two semi-finals . The EBU split up countries with a friendly voting history into separate semi-finals , to give a better chance for other countries to win . Greece and Cyprus had often been accused of favoring each other , with each awarding the other the maximum number of points ( twelve ) at the previous contest . On January 28 , 2008 , the EBU held a special draw which determined that Greece would be in '' Semi-final 1 '' held on May 20 , 2008 in Belgrade , Serbia ; Cyprus was subsequently placed in the second semi-final

QUERY_CONTEXT=Although Greece had been granted a spot in the 2008 final because of its seventh-place finish at the Eurovision Song Contest 2007 , it had to compete in a semi-final for the first time since 2004 because of new rules put into effect by the European Broadcasting Union ( EBU ) . In previous years , countries that received a top 10 placing were automatically granted a spot in the next year 's final without having to compete in a semi-final , but for 2008 , the EBU changed the automatic qualification regulations so that all countries except the " Big 4 " ( France , Germany , Spain , and the United Kingdom ) and host country , would have to pass through one of two semi-finals . The EBU split up countries with a friendly voting history into separate semi-finals , to give a better chance for other countries to win . Greece and Cyprus had often been accused of favoring each other , with each awarding the other the maximum number of points ( twelve ) at the previous contest . On January 28 , 2008 , the EBU held a special draw which determined that Greece would be in '' Semi-final 1 '' held on May 20 , 2008 in Belgrade , Serbia ; Cyprus was subsequently placed in the second semi-final

		CONTEXT=Although Greece had been granted a spot in the 2008 final because of its seventh-place finish at the Eurovision Song Contest 2007 , it had to compete in a semi-final for the first time since 2004 because of new rules put into effect by the European Broadcasting Union ( EBU ) . In previous years , countries that received a top 10 placing were automatically granted a spot in the next year 's final without having to compete in a semi-final , but for 2008 , the EBU changed the automatic qualification regulations so that all countries except the " Big 4 " ( France , Germany , Spain , and the United Kingdom ) and host country , would have to pass through one of two semi-finals . The EBU split up countries with a friendly voting history into separate semi-finals , to give a better chance for other countries to win . Greece and Cyprus had often been accused of favoring each other , with each awarding the other the maximum number of points ( twelve ) at the previous contest . On January 28 , 2008 , the EBU held a special draw which determined that Greece would be in '' Semi-final 1 '' held on May 20 , 2008 in Belgrade , Serbia ; Cyprus was subsequently placed in the second semi-final

		CONTEXT=" Motivation " is a R&B slow jam song written by Richard Butler ( Rico Love ) , Jim Jonsin , Dwayne Carter and Danny Morris . The racy lyrics center around Rowland asking her man to use his hands all over her body , and are accompanied by a " synth-saturated beat " produced by Jonsin . In terms of instruments , " Motivation " uses sparse keyboard notes , programmed beats and pulsing synths in the chorus . Wayne adds a rap verse complementing Rowland 's seductive suggestions , using the kitchen and a car as metaphors for sex . According to Scott Shetler from AOL Music , Rowland uses the lyrics to promise " to be her lover 's motivation . " Rowland called the record a mixture between dance and mash-up . When asked by MTV what Rowland thought of the song , she said , " It has that personality and characteristic to it that I do n't think anybody can deny . That 's why when Wayne dropped that insane verse on there ... I was like , ' You really brought that up even more . ' He went into the studio and just did it . I do n't think it takes much for Wayne to think . He just does it . He 's so admirable . " Ryan Brockington , from the '' New York Post , '' was amongst the first to review " Motivation . " In his review , he said " The single is a big leap from the dance club synth pop that Kelly has been releasing the past year and it seems like she might be trying to shimmy her way back into the hip-hop world by teaming up with the Midas touch vocals of Lil Wayne . " Both '' Rap-Up '' and AOL Music 's Scott Shetler called the song " sexy . " Becky Bain from Idolator disliked the song for not being memorable . The short review was summed up with the closing phrase , " she ’s going to need another hit to help promote her album when it finally is ready to drop . " Wesley Case from '' The Baltimore Sun '' complemented the song 's sexy quality . " If this is n't the year 's hands-down sexiest song thus far , it has to be in the discussion . Rowland , whose sultry voice could get a priest hot , weaving in and out of the minimal beat , and setting the table for Lil Wayne 's stuttering , after-hours guest-verse . Stack the pieces together and it 's an understated knockout that gets sexier with each spin . " Billboard ranked it number five on their " Critics ' Picks : 20 Best Songs of 2011 " " Motivation " was nominated for two awards at the 2011 Soul Train Music Awards including Best Dance Performance and Song of the Year.It won the award for Song of the Year and was also nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration at the 54th Grammy Awards , which was held on February 12 , 2012

QUERY_CONTEXT=Duane Allman created the idea of having two lead guitarists , which was inspired by Curtis Mayfield ; " he wanted the bass , keyboards , and second guitar to form patterns behind the solo rather than just comping , " said Allman . Their style and incorporation of guitar harmonies was very influential on later musicians . " The pair also had a wide range of complementary techniques , often forming intricate , interlocking patterns with each other and with the bassist , Berry Oakley , setting the stage for dramatic flights of improvised melodies . " Dickey Betts ' playing was very melody-based ; " My style is just a little too smooth and round to play the blues stuff straight , because I 'm such a melody guy that even when I 'm playing the blues , I go for melody first , " he said . His listening of country and string bluegrass growing up influenced this considerably : " I played mandolin , ukulele , and fiddle before I ever touched a guitar , which may be where a lot of the major keys I play come from . " He later characterized their style as " question and answer , anticipation and conclusion , " which involved allowing each musician 's downbeat to arrive in a different spot , while also keeping consideration of the bass guitar lines . The group also held an improvisational approach to live performances , which connected the band with jam band culture . " Jazz and blues musicians have been doing this for decades , but I think they really brought that sense that anyone onstage can inspire anyone else at any given time to rock music , " said Haynes . " We sure did n't set out to be a " jam band " but those long jams just emanated from within the band , because we did n't want to just play three minutes and be over , " said Allman . '' Rolling Stone '' referred to the group as " without question the first great jam band , and they took the jam to heights that it had not previously reached . " The Allman Brothers Band were considerably influential within the Southern United States . Their arrival on the musical scene paved the way for several other notable Southern rock bands — among those Lynyrd Skynyrd , the Marshall Tucker Band and Wet Willie — to achieve commercial success , and also " almost single-handedly " made Capricorn Records into " a major independent label . " Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top , writing for '' Rolling Stone '' , wrote that the group " defined the best of every music from the American South in that time . They were the best of all of us . " He went on to call the band " a true brotherhood of players — one that went beyond race and ego . It was a thing of beauty . " The band 's extended popularity through heavy touring in the early 1990s created a new generation of fans , one that viewed the Allmans as pioneers of " latter-day collegiate jam rock . " AllMusic praised the band 's history : " they went from being America 's single most influential band to a shell of their former self trading on past glories , to reach the 21st century resurrected as one of the most respected rock acts of their era . " In 2012 , an official historic marker was erected on the site of the July 1970 Second Atlanta International Pop Festival near Byron , Georgia . The Allman Brothers Band had played two sets at the festival , which was a significant event in their career . The marker text reads , in part : " Over thirty musical acts performed , including ... Macon 's Allman Brothers Band on their launching pad to national fame . " Official sponsors of the marker included the Georgia Allman Brothers Band Association , The Allman Brothers Band Museum at the Big House , and '' Hittin ' the Note '' . In 2003 , the band released a recording of their festival opening and closing performances , '' Live at the Atlanta International Pop Festival : July 3 & 5 , 1970 ''

QUERY_CONTEXT=In a positive review for '' Cuepoint '' , Robert Christgau argued that while Azalea may never demonstrate a powerful , soulful , or attractively melodic delivery , her " striving Australian-Atlantan cadence " is original and carries every song . He deemed ' ' The New Classic '' " plenty authentic -- and damn good to boot " while dismissing Azalea 's media naysayers : " predictably , the songs where she expresses wonderment that ' Impossible Is Nothing ' are more relatable than the ones where she flaunts her liquid assets . But the ones where she pledges to keep on striving are more relatable than that , because striving is built into her flow itself . That 's what her complexity is about . " Phil Johnson from '' The Independent '' called it " an instantly engaging showcase of the 23-year-old Aussie 's talents – poppy without diluting her fierce-flowing charisma . " Kellan Miller of '' XXL '' said despite some poor songs near the end of the record , it is " a persuasive indicator that Iggy Azalea will be around for the long haul . " '' The New Classic '' was named one of the best hip-hop albums of the year by '' XXL '' on a list published on 30 June 2014 , adding that " the album proved to a gang of skepts who doubted Iggy 's controversial style from the start that she was more than capable of making hip-hop tracks with a pop appeal . " It was placed at number twenty-five on Digital Spy 's top albums of 2014 and listed among Fuse 's 40 best albums of 2014 . The album won the Breakthrough Artist Release award at the 2014 ARIA Music Awards and Favorite Rap/Hip-Hop Album at the 2014 American Music Awards , beating out Drake 's '' Nothing Was the Same '' and Eminem 's '' The Marshall Mathers LP 2 '' . It received a nomination for Best Rap Album at the 57th Grammy Awards . The album was also up for Top Rap Album at the 2015 Billboard Music Awards

		CONTEXT=In a positive review for '' Cuepoint '' , Robert Christgau argued that while Azalea may never demonstrate a powerful , soulful , or attractively melodic delivery , her " striving Australian-Atlantan cadence " is original and carries every song . He deemed ' ' The New Classic '' " plenty authentic -- and damn good to boot " while dismissing Azalea 's media naysayers : " predictably , the songs where she expresses wonderment that ' Impossible Is Nothing ' are more relatable than the ones where she flaunts her liquid assets . But the ones where she pledges to keep on striving are more relatable than that , because striving is built into her flow itself . That 's what her complexity is about . " Phil Johnson from '' The Independent '' called it " an instantly engaging showcase of the 23-year-old Aussie 's talents – poppy without diluting her fierce-flowing charisma . " Kellan Miller of '' XXL '' said despite some poor songs near the end of the record , it is " a persuasive indicator that Iggy Azalea will be around for the long haul . " '' The New Classic '' was named one of the best hip-hop albums of the year by '' XXL '' on a list published on 30 June 2014 , adding that " the album proved to a gang of skepts who doubted Iggy 's controversial style from the start that she was more than capable of making hip-hop tracks with a pop appeal . " It was placed at number twenty-five on Digital Spy 's top albums of 2014 and listed among Fuse 's 40 best albums of 2014 . The album won the Breakthrough Artist Release award at the 2014 ARIA Music Awards and Favorite Rap/Hip-Hop Album at the 2014 American Music Awards , beating out Drake 's '' Nothing Was the Same '' and Eminem 's '' The Marshall Mathers LP 2 '' . It received a nomination for Best Rap Album at the 57th Grammy Awards . The album was also up for Top Rap Album at the 2015 Billboard Music Awards

		CONTEXT=In a positive review for '' Cuepoint '' , Robert Christgau argued that while Azalea may never demonstrate a powerful , soulful , or attractively melodic delivery , her " striving Australian-Atlantan cadence " is original and carries every song . He deemed ' ' The New Classic '' " plenty authentic -- and damn good to boot " while dismissing Azalea 's media naysayers : " predictably , the songs where she expresses wonderment that ' Impossible Is Nothing ' are more relatable than the ones where she flaunts her liquid assets . But the ones where she pledges to keep on striving are more relatable than that , because striving is built into her flow itself . That 's what her complexity is about . " Phil Johnson from '' The Independent '' called it " an instantly engaging showcase of the 23-year-old Aussie 's talents – poppy without diluting her fierce-flowing charisma . " Kellan Miller of '' XXL '' said despite some poor songs near the end of the record , it is " a persuasive indicator that Iggy Azalea will be around for the long haul . " '' The New Classic '' was named one of the best hip-hop albums of the year by '' XXL '' on a list published on 30 June 2014 , adding that " the album proved to a gang of skepts who doubted Iggy 's controversial style from the start that she was more than capable of making hip-hop tracks with a pop appeal . " It was placed at number twenty-five on Digital Spy 's top albums of 2014 and listed among Fuse 's 40 best albums of 2014 . The album won the Breakthrough Artist Release award at the 2014 ARIA Music Awards and Favorite Rap/Hip-Hop Album at the 2014 American Music Awards , beating out Drake 's '' Nothing Was the Same '' and Eminem 's '' The Marshall Mathers LP 2 '' . It received a nomination for Best Rap Album at the 57th Grammy Awards . The album was also up for Top Rap Album at the 2015 Billboard Music Awards

		CONTEXT=Crispi was replaced as prime minister by Antonio Di Rudinì in February 1891 , who was succeeded by Giovanni Giolitti in May 1892 . On January 20 , 1893 , when peasants of Caltavuturo occupied communal land that they claimed was theirs , local authorities killed 13 and wounded 21 in the Caltavuturo massacre . Disturbances continued throughout the year . The Fasci started out as urban movements , animated by artisans , which evolved into a more popular and combative mass movement with the adherence of sulphur miners , and in a later stage with the involvement of peasants and sharecroppers . In the autumn of 1893 , labour conflicts in the cities and the mines came together with the protests and claims of the farmers . The movement reached its greatest breadth in the manifestations against taxes , involving the lowest tiers of the city and the countryside , becoming difficult , if not impossible , to control by its leaders

In the autumn of 1893 , labour conflicts in the cities and the mines came together with the protests and claims of the farmers . The movement reached its greatest breadth in the manifestations against taxes , involving the lowest tiers of the city and the countryside , becoming difficult , if not impossible , to control by its leaders

QUERY_ANSWERS={'Caltavuturo massacre'}
QUERY_CONTEXT=According to many scholars , the name and origin of the town are traced back to the period of Arab rule . According to Ibn al-Athir ( '' The Complete History '' , VII .370.5 – 7 ) , in AH 268 ( 881/82 CE ) , the Aghlabid commander Abū Ṯawr was defeated by the Byzantines ( probably commanded by the '' strategos '' Mosilikes ) and his was army annihilated , with only seven men surviving . The locality was later named in Arabic '' Qalʿat Abī Ṯawr '' ( " Castle of Abū Ṯawr " ) , which is the origin of the modern name . Others instead maintain that the name derives from the Arabic word " qal ' at " ( fortress ) and the Sicilian " vuturu " ( vulture ) meaning of " fortress of vultures . " The town existed under Byzantine rule pre Arab conquest as Aziz Ahmad in “ A Islamic History of Sicily ” ( edinburgh university press 1975 ) states that in 852 Abbas raided Caltavuturo in the northern part of the Island and took many prisoners who were sold as slaves , The town was the site of the so-called Caltavuturo massacre on 20 January 1893 , when local authorities killed 13 and wounded 21 peasants that had occupied communal land that they claimed was theirs

The ELAS guerrillas , led by Alexis Rosios from Siatisti ( " Captain Ypsilantis " ) , who were active in the region , had attacked a German military phalanx at Daouli , close to Kleisoura , and had killed a vanguard of three motorcyclists . According to testimonies , the male residents , fearing retaliation , fled to the mountains surrounding the village . After finding the mutilated bodies of the Wehrmacht soldiers close to the local church , the German SS unit went to the homes , broke the doors of the majority of the houses , shot the people within , set fire to the buildings and also killed whom they found in the streets . Altogether 270 residents were killed , the overwhelming majority of them being women , children and elderly people . Involved in the atrocities was also a Bulgarian militia under German command , led by Andon Kalchev .

He testified that his soldiers were forced to kill the civilians because rebel forces were hiding and firing through the village , whereupon he was acquitted , despite the contradictory statements of his subordinates . After the war it was proved that his testimony was false

		CONTEXT='' The Amazing Race '' won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Reality-Competition Program for the first seven years after the creation of the award in 2003 , and ten of the twelve years since its creation , against other , more popular reality TV shows such as '' Survivor '' , '' Dancing with the Stars '' , and '' American Idol '' . Its streak was ended in 2010 when '' Top Chef '' won the Emmy for this category . Host Phil Keoghan revealed in an interview that the show 's loss that year made him and the producers realize that they will have to try harder to win the Emmy again . In 2011 , the show won in the category again for the eighth time . After its seventh consecutive win , some in the media , including '' Survivor '' host Jeff Probst suggested that '' The Amazing Race '' willingly drop out from the competition in future years , similar to Candice Bergen declining any further nominations after her fifth Emmy win for her role in '' Murphy Brown '' . Van Munster has stated that it is " not likely " he will pull the show from future Emmy awards , considering that it reflects on his and his crew 's hard work and high standards . The show has also been nominated and won several times for technical production ( Creative Arts ) Emmy awards , for Cinematography and Picture Editing for Non-Fiction programs , whereas it has only been nominated for Sound Mixing and Sound Editing for Non-Fiction programs . The show has been nominated in the same five categories for three years consecutively , a trend which continued with the 2007 Primetime Emmy Awards

In 2011 , the show won in the category again for the eighth time . After its seventh consecutive win , some in the media , including '' Survivor '' host Jeff Probst suggested that '' The Amazing Race '' willingly drop out from the competition in future years , similar to Candice Bergen declining any further nominations after her fifth Emmy win for her role in '' Murphy Brown '' . Van Munster has stated that it is " not likely " he will pull the show from future Emmy awards , considering that it reflects on his and his crew 's hard work and high standards .

In the U.S. Presidential campaign of 1848 , Gibson supported Whig candidate , " Rough and Ready " General Zachary Taylor . However , he was concerned about the Whig Party 's lack of opposition to the abolition of slavery and personally visited Henry Clay at his home in Ashland , Kentucky in 1848 to discuss this issue . He lost as a Whig candidate for Ohio Attorney General in 1853 . In 1853 , following the large defeat of the Whig candidate General Winfield Scott in the U.S. Presidential election of 1852 , Gibson threw his support to the Free Soil Party and began organizing what would become the Republican Party in Ohio .

QUERY_CONTEXT=The first official Republican convention in Illinois was held on May 29 , 1856 , in Bloomington . Chairman John M. Palmer was elected convention president after his opening address . Nine vice presidents and five secretaries were then elected . The convention nominated Bissell for governor with Francis Hoffmann as lieutenant governor , Ozias M. Hatch for secretary of state , Jesse K. Dubois as auditor , and James Miller as treasurer . Hoffmann was found to be ineligible for his position due to a residency requirement , and John Wood was nominated in his place . The following resolutions defining the party platform were approved : Resolved , That foregoing all former differences of opinions upon other questions , we pledge ourselves to unite in opposition to the present administration and to the party which upholds and supports it and to use all honorable and constitutional means to wrest the Government from the unworthy hands which now control it and to bring it back in its administration to the principles and practices of Washington , Jefferson and their great and good compatriots of the Revolution . Resolved , That foregoing all former differences of opinions upon other questions , we pledge ourselves to unite in opposition to the present administration of the Government ; that under the Constitution Congress possesses the power to prohibit slavery in the Territories ; and that , whilst we will maintain all constitutional rights of the South , we also hold that justice , humanity , the principles of freedom as expressed in our Declaration of Independence and our national constitution , and the purity and perpetuity of our Government require that that power shall be exerted to prevent the extension of slavery into territory heretofore free . Resolved , That the repeal of the Missouri Compromise was unwise and injurious ; an open and aggravated violation of the plighted faith of the States , and that the attempt of the present administration to force slavery into Kansas against the known wishes of the legal voters of that Territory is an arbitrary and tyrannous violation of the rights of the people to govern themselves , and that we will strive by all constitutional means to secure to Kansas and Nebraska the legal guaranty against slavery of which they were deprived at the cost of the violation of the plighted faith of the nation . Resolved , That we are devoted to the Union and will , to the last extremity , defend it against the efforts now being made by the dis-unionists of this administration to compass its dissolution , and that we will support the Constitution of the United States , in all its provisions regarding it , as the sacred bond of our Union and the only safeguard for the preservation of the rights of ourselves and our posterity . Resolved , That we are in favor of the immediate admission of Kansas as a member of this Confederacy under the constitution adopted by the people of said Territory . Resolved , That the spirit of our institutions as well as the Constitution of our country , guarantees the liberty of conscience as well as political freedom , and that we will proscribe no one by legislation or otherwise on account of religious opinions , or in consequence of place of birth . Lincoln delivered the closing address . The speech was purportedly so captivating that no reporter made a record of it . The address has become known as Lincoln 's Lost Speech .

Resolved , That foregoing all former differences of opinions upon other questions , we pledge ourselves to unite in opposition to the present administration of the Government ; that under the Constitution Congress possesses the power to prohibit slavery in the Territories ; and that , whilst we will maintain all constitutional rights of the South , we also hold that justice , humanity , the principles of freedom as expressed in our Declaration of Independence and our national constitution , and the purity and perpetuity of our Government require that that power shall be exerted to prevent the extension of slavery into territory heretofore free . Resolved , That the repeal of the Missouri Compromise was unwise and injurious ; an open and aggravated violation of the plighted faith of the States , and that the attempt of the present administration to force slavery into Kansas against the known wishes of the legal voters of that Territory is an arbitrary and tyrannous violation of the rights of the people to govern themselves , and that we will strive by all constitutional means to secure to Kansas and Nebraska the legal guaranty against slavery of which they were deprived at the cost of the violation of the plighted faith of the nation . Resolved , That we are devoted to the Union and will , to the last extremity , defend it against the efforts now being made by the dis-unionists of this administration to compass its dissolution , and that we will support the Constitution of the United States , in all its provisions regarding it , as the sacred bond of our Union and the only safeguard for the preservation of the rights of ourselves and our posterity . Resolved , That we are in favor of the immediate admission of Kansas as a member of this Confederacy under the constitution adopted by the people of said Territory . Resolved , That the spirit of our institutions as well as the Constitution of our country , guarantees the liberty of conscience as well as political freedom , and that we will proscribe no one by legislation or otherwise on account of religious opinions , or in consequence of place of birth .

The racy lyrics center around Rowland asking her man to use his hands all over her body , and are accompanied by a " synth-saturated beat " produced by Jonsin . In terms of instruments , " Motivation " uses sparse keyboard notes , programmed beats and pulsing synths in the chorus . Wayne adds a rap verse complementing Rowland 's seductive suggestions , using the kitchen and a car as metaphors for sex . According to Scott Shetler from AOL Music , Rowland uses the lyrics to promise " to be her lover 's motivation . " Rowland called the record a mixture between dance and mash-up .

Mining accidents continue worldwide , including accidents causing dozens of fatalities at a time such as the 2007 Ulyanovskaya Mine disaster in Russia , the 2009 Heilongjiang mine explosion in China , and the 2010 Upper Big Branch Mine disaster in the United States . Mining has been identified by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ( NIOSH ) as a priority industry sector in the National Occupational Research Agenda ( NORA ) to identify and provide intervention strategies regarding occupational health and safety issues . The Mining Safety and Health Administration ( MSHA ) was established in 1978 to " work to prevent death , illness , and injury from mining and promote safe and healthful workplaces for US miners .

		CONTEXT=The Temple of Bacchus — once wrongly credited to Jupiter — may have been completed under Septimius Severus in the 190s , as his coins are the first to show it beside the Temple of Jupiter . It is the best preserved of the sanctuary 's structures , as the other rubble from its ruins protected it . It is enriched by some of the most refined reliefs and sculpture to survive from antiquity . The temple is surrounded by forty-two columns — 8 along each end and 15 along each side — nearly in height . These were probably erected in a rough state and then rounded , polished , and decorated in position . The entrance was preserved as late as Pococke and Wood , but the keystone of the lintel had slid following the 1759 earthquakes ; a column of rough masonry was erected in the 1860s or '70s to support it . The 1759 earthquakes also damaged the area around the soffit 's famed inscription of an eagle , which was entirely covered by the keystone 's supporting column.The area around the inscription of the eagle was greatly damaged by the 1759 earthquake . The interior of the temple is divided into a nave and a adytum or sanctuary on a platform raised above it and fronted by 13 steps . The screen between the two sections once held reliefs of Neptune , Triton , Arion and his dolphin , and other marine figures but these have been lost . The temple was used as a kind of donjon for the medieval Arab and Turkish fortifications , although its eastern steps were lost sometime after 1688 . Much of the portico was incorporated into a huge wall directly before its gate , but this was demolished in July 1870 by Barker on orders from Syria 's governor Rashid Pasha . Two spiral staircases in columns on either side of the entrance lead to the roof

		GOLD_MENTION=arrested and deported
		SCORE=1.3430932540359208e-05
		CONTEXT=During the Armenian Genocide — along with hundreds of other Armenian intellectuals — Komitas was arrested and deported to a prison camp in April 1915 by the Ottoman government . He was soon released under unclear circumstances and experienced a mental breakdown and developed a severe case of posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) . The widespread hostile environment in Constantinople and reports of mass-scale Armenian death marches and massacres that reached him further worsened his fragile mental state . He was first placed in a Turkish military-operated hospital until 1919 and then transferred to psychiatric hospitals in Paris , where he spent the last years of his life in agony . Komitas is widely seen as a martyr of the genocide and has been depicted as one of the main symbols of the Armenian Genocide in art

		CONTEXT=As the Big East season progressed , the lack of a reliable shooting guard hurt Georgetown . Four different underclassmen started at the position , and , with poor shooting from the field by guards John Jacques ( 36.2 % in Big East play ) , Eric Micoud ( 34.3 % ) , and Irvin Church ( 17.9 % ) plaguing the Hoyas , they lost eight of their last eleven conference games to finish the Big East regular season with an 8-10 record , good for only an eighth-place finish . In the Big East Tournament , they defeated Miami in the first round but lost to ninth-ranked Seton Hall in the quarterfinal . Their 16-12 overall record at the end of the tournament , combined with their losing regular-season conference record and a weak non-conference schedule that included three non-Division I opponents , prevented them from receiving an invitation to the 1993 NCAA Tournament , breaking a 14-season streak of NCAA Tournament appearances for Georgetown dating back to the 1978-79 season

Previously known as '' The Invaders '' , the film was in works from the late 1990s and was due originally to feature Hollywood actors Brendan Fraser and Neve Campbell and Bollywood actors Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Vivek Oberoi . The Anglo-Indian historical romance is Bipasha Basu 's first English language film . She was encouraged to take up her international debut by Oscar-winning actress Hilary Swank . Basu first met up with Swank at the New Seven Wonders of the World Official Declaration ceremony convened in Lisbon in 2007 and met her again at the 2011 International Indian Film Academy Awards in Toronto . Though originally planned for shooting partly in the United Kingdom , production began in Queensland , Australia , on 8 November 2010 . It concluded there on the third week of December 2010 . The production then moved to India on 31 March 2011 for a further five weeks , roaming the rocky terrain of Chambal , Orchha and Gwalior in the state of Madhya Pradesh . Principal photography wrapped on 23 April 2011 . The film was planned to premiere at the 65th annual Cannes International Film Festival in May 2012 , but in late 2011 the production company was placed in administration and all further filming was stopped when some ten percent remained . In June 2012 , Belgian-based financing and production outfit Corsan agreed to put further money into the production , and the final scenes were to be shot in London . In September 2012 , it was reported that the filming in London was finished , while some creditors were still waiting for payment . And in May 2013 , producer Paul Breuls confirmed that the film has been finally completed and aims to launch it at an autumn festival
