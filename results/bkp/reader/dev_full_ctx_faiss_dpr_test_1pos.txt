QUERY_ANSWERS={'1977 flood', 'Johnstown Flood of 1977', 'massive flood'}
QUERY_CONTEXT=The flood was preceded by rains from March 9 that did not stop until March 22 , 1936 . The storms brought warmer 50 °F ( 10 °C ) weather that was a cause of one stage of flooding and the continuous rains a second cause of flooding . The natural run-off of 1 to 3 inches ( 2.5 to 7.5 cm ) was far surpassed by the deluge of from 10 to 30 inches ( 25 to 75 cm ) of water in the region . The flood came before pending flood control legislation was enacted or any significant flood control measures implemented . The narrowness of the valleys and encroachment of buildings on the river banks contributed to record flooding . By the time nightfall came one-third of the city was under of water and by the time flooding was over twenty-five people lost their lives . The damages , estimated at $ 43 million , made it the worst flood since the flood of 1889 and the event is chronicled at the Johnstown Flood Museum After the flood , sweeping nationwide flood control laws were enacted and from 1938 to 1943 Johnstown saw many projects completed .

QUERY_CONTEXT=In the 1959 review for '' Sight & Sound '' , David Vaughan calls '' Gigi '' " an elegant film " with a " cultivated visual taste which is everywhere apparent " . He summarises that " while '' Gigi '' does not represent a revival of the MGM musical in its heyday , it is a welcome extension of latter-day musical style in its adult subject-matter and its avoidance of spectacle made vulgar by emphasis on size . " He praises Minnelli 's talent for " the delicious amorality of the anecdote , but also the honesty and irony of its telling which have become foreign to the American cinema . " Vaughan points out " Chevalier 's practiced but irresistible charm as one of the film 's greatest assets " as well as " the brilliant high-comedy playing of Isabel Jeans , who as Aunt Alicia consummately portrays the distinction and beauty of a retired aristocrat of the '' demimonde '' . " Bosley Crowther of '' The New York Times '' called it " a musical film that bears such a basic resemblance to '' My Fair Lady '' that the authors may want to sue themselves " . He added , " But do n't think this point of resemblance is made in criticism of the film , for '' Gigi '' is a charming entertainment that can stand on its own two legs . It is not only a charming comprehension of the spicy confection of Colette , but it is also a lovely and lyrical enlargement upon that story 's flavored mood and atmosphere … Vincente Minnelli has marshaled a cast to give a set of performances that , for quality and harmony , are superb . " Abel Green of '' Variety '' called the film " 100 % escapist fare " and predicted it " is destined for a global box-office mop-up " . He added , " Alan Jay Lerner 's libretto is tailor-made for an inspired casting job for all principals , and Fritz Loewe 's tunes ( to Lerner 's lyrics ) already vie with and suggest their memorable '' My Fair Lady '' score … Miss Caron is completely captivating and convincing in the title role … Skillful casting , performance and presentation have endowed realism to the sum total … Director Minnelli 's good taste in keeping it in bounds and the general sound judgment of all concerned … distinguishes this Arthur Freed independent production . The Metrocolor rates recognition for its soft pastels under Joseph Ruttenberg 's lensing ; the Beaton costumes , sets and general production design are vivid physical assets at first sight . The skillful integration of words-and-music with the plot motivation makes this '' Gigi '' a very fair lady indeed as a boxoffice entry . " '' Time Out New York '' said , " The dominating creative contribution comes from Minnelli and Cecil Beaton … The combination of these two visual elitists is really too much — it 's like a meal consisting of cheesecake , and one quickly longs for something solid and vulgar to weigh things down . No doubt inspired by the finicky , claustrophobic sets and bric-à-brac , the cast tries ( with unfortunate success ) to be more French than the French , especially Chevalier . The exception is Gingold , who inhabits , as always , a world of her own . " '' TV Guide '' rated the film 3 ½ out of five stars , calling it " Overbaked but enjoyable , and a banquet for the eyes , thanks to the visual wonder of the Minnelli-Beaton teaming … Caron … leads the cast in a contest to see who can be the most French . The winner is Chevalier , in a performance that makes one feel as if you 're gagging on pastry … Perhaps if the sweetness of '' Gigi '' was contrasted with elements of honest vulgarity , the picture could balance itself out … Ten minutes into the movie , you 've resolved the plot and are left to wallow in lovely frou-frou . The film makes wonderful use of the usual Parisian landmarks , and benefits from extraordinary period costumes and sets . " '' Gigi '' won a record-breaking nine Academy Awards ( at the 1959 Oscars ceremony ) ; however , this record only lasted for one year , as '' Ben-Hur '' broke this record the following year with 11 Oscars . In tribute to '' Gigi '' s domination of the Oscars , the MGM switchboard answered calls the following day with " M-Gigi-M " . '' Gigi '' , eventually along with 1987 's '' The Last Emperor '' , held the record as the film ( s ) with the most Academy Award wins in every category in which it was nominated , until 2003 's '' The Lord of the Rings : The Return of the King '' broke the record at the 2004 Oscars ceremony with 11 Oscar nominations and 11 Oscar wins

Nothing is known of what happened to him afterwards , and it was rumoured that he was either killed in Podravina in 1945 , died fighting with the Crusaders in Herzegovina in 1947 , or , less likely , emigrated to the United States via Argentina , joined the United States Army and fought Communist forces in the Korean War . In 1951 , he was named the Croatian Minister of Defence in - exile by Ustaše leader Ante Pavelić .

		CONTEXT=He arrived at the club as an incredibly shy and underdeveloped personality , a fact that was noted by teammate Trent Cotchin who said though Martin was 18 “ he seemed much younger in some of the ways he behaved . ” Indeed , he struggled initially to adjust to the expectations of professional football . In one incident in the 2010 preseason he was removed from training and verbally reprimanded by club leadership when he was deemed unfit to train after a big night out . Despite these struggles , his on-field development was such that he would still debut in the 2010 season 's opening match , a 56-point Richmond loss against at the MCG . Martin recorded the sixth most disposals of any Tiger ( 18 ) to go along with four marks , three tackles and three clearances . Two weeks later Martin was convicted by the AFL tribunal for a high hit on Sydney 's Josh Kennedy in round 3 . He did not receive a suspension for the incident however , returning to football the following week . After four matches Martin ranked fourth in the league for clearances and eighth for hard-ball gets . Media reports emerged after round 8 that the 18 year old Martin had received a significant contract offer from expansion club the Greater Western Sydney Giants . The offer , which the Herald Sun ’s Mark Robinson claimed to be worth $ 2.4 million over three seasons , would have taken effect in the new club 's first AFL season in 2012 . Martin later said he had never entertained the idea of moving to the start-up club . In round 10 he had gained attention for his on-field efforts again , this time being nominated for the 2010 AFL Rising Star award after a 21 disposal and 11 clearance match against Port Adelaide . Due to his previous tribunal conviction however , Martin was ruled ineligible for the award and thus did not officially place in the end of season award 's points tally . He drew the attention of Sydney coach Paul Roos by round 14 , prompting Roos to send veteran Brett Kirk onto Martin in a tagging role . Despite this extra attention , he still managed to record 18 disposals and a goal in the match at the MCG . After 17 rounds Martin ranked second at the club for clearances and inside 50s as well as third for disposals and contested possessions . At the same time he ranked first among that season 's Rising Star nominees in clearances , contested possessions and inside 50s . He was also fourth for average disposals and fifth for average tackles . In round 19 he was rested by the club before returning to play out the final five matches of the season . He missed just that one game in his debut season and finished the year ranked second at Richmond for clearances and inside 50s , as well as third for both contested possessions and disposals . In addition to winning the Fred Swift Medal for fourth place at the club 's best and fairest night , Martin also received six votes in the Brownlow Medal count that year , the most by any Richmond debutant since Craig Lambert in 1988 . At season 's end he reiterated his commitment to the club ( and rejection of the former GWS overtures ) by signing a two-year contract extension that would keep him at Richmond until the end of the 2013 season . The extension was reported by the Herald Sun to be in the vicinity of $ 400,000-a-year

QUERY_CONTEXT=" Motivation " is a R&B slow jam song written by Richard Butler ( Rico Love ) , Jim Jonsin , Dwayne Carter and Danny Morris . The racy lyrics center around Rowland asking her man to use his hands all over her body , and are accompanied by a " synth-saturated beat " produced by Jonsin . In terms of instruments , " Motivation " uses sparse keyboard notes , programmed beats and pulsing synths in the chorus . Wayne adds a rap verse complementing Rowland 's seductive suggestions , using the kitchen and a car as metaphors for sex . According to Scott Shetler from AOL Music , Rowland uses the lyrics to promise " to be her lover 's motivation . " Rowland called the record a mixture between dance and mash-up . When asked by MTV what Rowland thought of the song , she said , " It has that personality and characteristic to it that I do n't think anybody can deny . That 's why when Wayne dropped that insane verse on there ... I was like , ' You really brought that up even more . ' He went into the studio and just did it . I do n't think it takes much for Wayne to think . He just does it . He 's so admirable . " Ryan Brockington , from the '' New York Post , '' was amongst the first to review " Motivation . " In his review , he said " The single is a big leap from the dance club synth pop that Kelly has been releasing the past year and it seems like she might be trying to shimmy her way back into the hip-hop world by teaming up with the Midas touch vocals of Lil Wayne . " Both '' Rap-Up '' and AOL Music 's Scott Shetler called the song " sexy . " Becky Bain from Idolator disliked the song for not being memorable . The short review was summed up with the closing phrase , " she ’s going to need another hit to help promote her album when it finally is ready to drop . " Wesley Case from '' The Baltimore Sun '' complemented the song 's sexy quality . " If this is n't the year 's hands-down sexiest song thus far , it has to be in the discussion . Rowland , whose sultry voice could get a priest hot , weaving in and out of the minimal beat , and setting the table for Lil Wayne 's stuttering , after-hours guest-verse . Stack the pieces together and it 's an understated knockout that gets sexier with each spin .

QUERY_ANSWERS={'were massacred', 'Mudan incident'}
QUERY_CONTEXT=And Japan was eager to take every opportunity . In 1869 they took advantage of the defeat of the rebels of the Republic of Ezo to incorporate definitely the island of Hokkaido to Japan . For centuries , Japan viewed the Ryukyu Islands as one of its provinces . In 1871 the Mudan incident happened : cannibal Taiwanese aborigines murdered 54 Ryūkyūan sailors that had their ship shipwrecked . At that time the Ryukyu Islands were claimed by both Qing China and Japan , and the Japanese interpreted the incident as an attack on their citizens . They took steps to bring the islands in their jurisdiction : in 1872 the Japanese Ryukyu Domain was declared , and in 1874 a retaliatory incursion to Taiwan was sent , which was a success . The success of this expedition emboldened the Japanese : not even the Americans could defeat the Taiwanese cannibals in the Formosa Expedition of 1867 . Very few gave it much thought at the time , but this was the first move in the Japanese expansionism series . Japan occupied Taiwan for the rest of 1874 and then left owing to Chinese pressures , but in 1879 it finally annexed the Ryukyu Islands . In 1875 Qing China sent a 300-men force to subdue the Taiwanese cannibals , but unlike the Japanese the Chinese were routed , ambushed and 250 of their men were killed ; the failure of this expedition exposed once more the failure of Qing China to exert effective control in Taiwan , and acted as another incentive for the Japanese to annex Taiwan . Eventually , the spoils for winning the First Sino-Japanese War in 1894 included Taiwan

		GOLD_MENTION=1988 earthquake
		CONTEXT=In 1979 , the total Armenian population of the districts of Kalbajar , Lachin , Qubadli , Zangilan , Jabrayil , Fuzuli and Agdam was around 1,400 people . An OSCE fact-finding mission established at Azerbaijan 's request visited these regions in February 2005 with the intention to assess the scale of the settlement attempts . The mission 's findings showed that these districts had as of 2005 an overall population of 14,000 persons , mostly living in precarious social conditions . It consisted primarily of ethnic Armenians displaced from the non-conflict zones of Azerbaijan during the war . It was noted , however , that most of them had settled in the conflict zone after having lived in Armenia for several years and some held Armenian passports and even voted in Armenian elections . A smaller segment of the settlers were originally from the towns of Gyumri and Spitak in Armenia who had lived in temporary shelters following the devastating 1988 earthquake before moving to Karabakh , as well as a small number of natives of Yerevan who moved there for financial reasons . A field assessment mission revisited the region in October 2010 , confirming that there had not been much growth in population or change in the living conditions of the settlers . The Co-Chairs of the Minsk Group who visited Nagorno-Karabakh , Kalbajar and Lachin in 2014 reported seeing signs of improvements in the infrastructure but could not observe any indications that the size of the population had changed in recent years
