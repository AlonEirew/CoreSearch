QUERY_CONTEXT=In the 1959 review for '' Sight & Sound '' , David Vaughan calls '' Gigi '' " an elegant film " with a " cultivated visual taste which is everywhere apparent " . He summarises that " while '' Gigi '' does not represent a revival of the MGM musical in its heyday , it is a welcome extension of latter-day musical style in its adult subject-matter and its avoidance of spectacle made vulgar by emphasis on size . " He praises Minnelli 's talent for " the delicious amorality of the anecdote , but also the honesty and irony of its telling which have become foreign to the American cinema . " Vaughan points out " Chevalier 's practiced but irresistible charm as one of the film 's greatest assets " as well as " the brilliant high-comedy playing of Isabel Jeans , who as Aunt Alicia consummately portrays the distinction and beauty of a retired aristocrat of the '' demimonde '' . " Bosley Crowther of '' The New York Times '' called it " a musical film that bears such a basic resemblance to '' My Fair Lady '' that the authors may want to sue themselves " . He added , " But do n't think this point of resemblance is made in criticism of the film , for '' Gigi '' is a charming entertainment that can stand on its own two legs . It is not only a charming comprehension of the spicy confection of Colette , but it is also a lovely and lyrical enlargement upon that story 's flavored mood and atmosphere … Vincente Minnelli has marshaled a cast to give a set of performances that , for quality and harmony , are superb . " Abel Green of '' Variety '' called the film " 100 % escapist fare " and predicted it " is destined for a global box-office mop-up " . He added , " Alan Jay Lerner 's libretto is tailor-made for an inspired casting job for all principals , and Fritz Loewe 's tunes ( to Lerner 's lyrics ) already vie with and suggest their memorable '' My Fair Lady '' score … Miss Caron is completely captivating and convincing in the title role … Skillful casting , performance and presentation have endowed realism to the sum total … Director Minnelli 's good taste in keeping it in bounds and the general sound judgment of all concerned … distinguishes this Arthur Freed independent production . The Metrocolor rates recognition for its soft pastels under Joseph Ruttenberg 's lensing ; the Beaton costumes , sets and general production design are vivid physical assets at first sight . The skillful integration of words-and-music with the plot motivation makes this '' Gigi '' a very fair lady indeed as a boxoffice entry . " '' Time Out New York '' said , " The dominating creative contribution comes from Minnelli and Cecil Beaton … The combination of these two visual elitists is really too much — it 's like a meal consisting of cheesecake , and one quickly longs for something solid and vulgar to weigh things down . No doubt inspired by the finicky , claustrophobic sets and bric-à-brac , the cast tries ( with unfortunate success ) to be more French than the French , especially Chevalier . The exception is Gingold , who inhabits , as always , a world of her own . " '' TV Guide '' rated the film 3 ½ out of five stars , calling it " Overbaked but enjoyable , and a banquet for the eyes , thanks to the visual wonder of the Minnelli-Beaton teaming … Caron … leads the cast in a contest to see who can be the most French . The winner is Chevalier , in a performance that makes one feel as if you 're gagging on pastry … Perhaps if the sweetness of '' Gigi '' was contrasted with elements of honest vulgarity , the picture could balance itself out … Ten minutes into the movie , you 've resolved the plot and are left to wallow in lovely frou-frou . The film makes wonderful use of the usual Parisian landmarks , and benefits from extraordinary period costumes and sets . " '' Gigi '' won a record-breaking nine Academy Awards ( at the 1959 Oscars ceremony ) ; however , this record only lasted for one year , as '' Ben-Hur '' broke this record the following year with 11 Oscars . In tribute to '' Gigi '' s domination of the Oscars , the MGM switchboard answered calls the following day with " M-Gigi-M " . '' Gigi '' , eventually along with 1987 's '' The Last Emperor '' , held the record as the film ( s ) with the most Academy Award wins in every category in which it was nominated , until 2003 's '' The Lord of the Rings : The Return of the King '' broke the record at the 2004 Oscars ceremony with 11 Oscar nominations and 11 Oscar wins

Disturbances continued throughout the year . The Fasci started out as urban movements , animated by artisans , which evolved into a more popular and combative mass movement with the adherence of sulphur miners , and in a later stage with the involvement of peasants and sharecroppers . In the autumn of 1893 , labour conflicts in the cities and the mines came together with the protests and claims of the farmers . The movement reached its greatest breadth in the manifestations against taxes , involving the lowest tiers of the city and the countryside , becoming difficult , if not impossible , to control by its leaders

		ANSWER=Montreal massacre
		GOLD_MENTION=Montreal massacre
		CONTEXT=Adam Thrasher argued that the " Take Back the Night " marches cause polarization in gender relations , since women discourage men from participating . Thrasher said , as paraphrased by Dan Lazin of '' The Gateway '' , that " unthinking men may be incited to further hatred towards women . " Thrasher argued that while the strips criticize " the ideas of some hard-core feminists , " they are not against all women . Thrasher added that " The reason I did it is because it 's such a taboo to make fun of violence against women , against Take Back the Night . " Thrasher also stated that " When I drew up the cartoon , I was n't thinking about Marc Lepine and the Montreal massacre which was a crime against humanity , I think , more than a crime against women . " A Saturday October 25 , 1997 , editorial of '' The Globe and Mail '' argued that the actions against Thrasher were censorship and that " the instinct to block the juvenile humour was more disturbing than the juvenalia itself . " The '' Alberta Report '' said in 1997 that " '' Space Moose '' is a festival of caricatured scatology , violence , perversion , irreligion and even pedophilia . It has stimulated outrage before , but in five years the university had never suppressed the strip , despite lampoons of University institutions , Trekkies , the mentally retarded , and Christians . Only one group , it seems , has the clout to make the university turn censor . " In response to Thrasher 's argument that the marches could polarize gender relations and that the comic had a different message than perceived , Gretchen Hess said that the intent of the strip was not easily discernible and that the effect of the strip should be considered in addition to the intent . Linda Trimble argued that " t he pretty direct message of the cartoon was ' It 's open season on feminists . Kill all the women . " Joyce Green , a University of Regina political science professor who was another complainant , argued that " I do n't see any difference between the Montreal Massacre and the cartoon . " Green added that the group had complained about the strips " not because we 're paranoid but because we 're terrified . " Shannon Sampert , a political science student who was another one of the complainants , said that she was not surprised that the appeal went in favor of Thrasher . She believed that additional students would try to take the course of action that Thrasher took , and she believed that Feminists would cause an outcry against the appeals

		CONTEXT=He arrived at the club as an incredibly shy and underdeveloped personality , a fact that was noted by teammate Trent Cotchin who said though Martin was 18 “ he seemed much younger in some of the ways he behaved . ” Indeed , he struggled initially to adjust to the expectations of professional football . In one incident in the 2010 preseason he was removed from training and verbally reprimanded by club leadership when he was deemed unfit to train after a big night out . Despite these struggles , his on-field development was such that he would still debut in the 2010 season 's opening match , a 56-point Richmond loss against at the MCG . Martin recorded the sixth most disposals of any Tiger ( 18 ) to go along with four marks , three tackles and three clearances . Two weeks later Martin was convicted by the AFL tribunal for a high hit on Sydney 's Josh Kennedy in round 3 . He did not receive a suspension for the incident however , returning to football the following week . After four matches Martin ranked fourth in the league for clearances and eighth for hard-ball gets . Media reports emerged after round 8 that the 18 year old Martin had received a significant contract offer from expansion club the Greater Western Sydney Giants . The offer , which the Herald Sun ’s Mark Robinson claimed to be worth $ 2.4 million over three seasons , would have taken effect in the new club 's first AFL season in 2012 . Martin later said he had never entertained the idea of moving to the start-up club . In round 10 he had gained attention for his on-field efforts again , this time being nominated for the 2010 AFL Rising Star award after a 21 disposal and 11 clearance match against Port Adelaide . Due to his previous tribunal conviction however , Martin was ruled ineligible for the award and thus did not officially place in the end of season award 's points tally . He drew the attention of Sydney coach Paul Roos by round 14 , prompting Roos to send veteran Brett Kirk onto Martin in a tagging role . Despite this extra attention , he still managed to record 18 disposals and a goal in the match at the MCG . After 17 rounds Martin ranked second at the club for clearances and inside 50s as well as third for disposals and contested possessions . At the same time he ranked first among that season 's Rising Star nominees in clearances , contested possessions and inside 50s . He was also fourth for average disposals and fifth for average tackles . In round 19 he was rested by the club before returning to play out the final five matches of the season . He missed just that one game in his debut season and finished the year ranked second at Richmond for clearances and inside 50s , as well as third for both contested possessions and disposals . In addition to winning the Fred Swift Medal for fourth place at the club 's best and fairest night , Martin also received six votes in the Brownlow Medal count that year , the most by any Richmond debutant since Craig Lambert in 1988 . At season 's end he reiterated his commitment to the club ( and rejection of the former GWS overtures ) by signing a two-year contract extension that would keep him at Richmond until the end of the 2013 season . The extension was reported by the Herald Sun to be in the vicinity of $ 400,000-a-year

QUERY_CONTEXT=" Motivation " is a R&B slow jam song written by Richard Butler ( Rico Love ) , Jim Jonsin , Dwayne Carter and Danny Morris . The racy lyrics center around Rowland asking her man to use his hands all over her body , and are accompanied by a " synth-saturated beat " produced by Jonsin . In terms of instruments , " Motivation " uses sparse keyboard notes , programmed beats and pulsing synths in the chorus . Wayne adds a rap verse complementing Rowland 's seductive suggestions , using the kitchen and a car as metaphors for sex . According to Scott Shetler from AOL Music , Rowland uses the lyrics to promise " to be her lover 's motivation . " Rowland called the record a mixture between dance and mash-up . When asked by MTV what Rowland thought of the song , she said , " It has that personality and characteristic to it that I do n't think anybody can deny . That 's why when Wayne dropped that insane verse on there ... I was like , ' You really brought that up even more . ' He went into the studio and just did it . I do n't think it takes much for Wayne to think . He just does it . He 's so admirable . " Ryan Brockington , from the '' New York Post , '' was amongst the first to review " Motivation . " In his review , he said " The single is a big leap from the dance club synth pop that Kelly has been releasing the past year and it seems like she might be trying to shimmy her way back into the hip-hop world by teaming up with the Midas touch vocals of Lil Wayne . " Both '' Rap-Up '' and AOL Music 's Scott Shetler called the song " sexy . " Becky Bain from Idolator disliked the song for not being memorable . The short review was summed up with the closing phrase , " she ’s going to need another hit to help promote her album when it finally is ready to drop . " Wesley Case from '' The Baltimore Sun '' complemented the song 's sexy quality . " If this is n't the year 's hands-down sexiest song thus far , it has to be in the discussion . Rowland , whose sultry voice could get a priest hot , weaving in and out of the minimal beat , and setting the table for Lil Wayne 's stuttering , after-hours guest-verse . Stack the pieces together and it 's an understated knockout that gets sexier with each spin . " Billboard ranked it number five on their " Critics ' Picks : 20 Best Songs of 2011 " " Motivation " was nominated for two awards at the 2011 Soul Train Music Awards including Best Dance Performance and Song of the Year.It won the award for Song of the Year and was also nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration at the 54th Grammy Awards , which was held on February 12 , 2012

		CONTEXT=Safety has long been a concern in the mining business , especially in sub-surface mining . The Courrières mine disaster , Europe 's worst mining accident , involved the death of 1,099 miners in Northern France on March 10 , 1906 . This disaster was surpassed only by the Benxihu Colliery accident in China on April 26 , 1942 , which killed 1,549 miners . While mining today is substantially safer than it was in previous decades , mining accidents still occur . Government figures indicate that 5,000 Chinese miners die in accidents each year , while other reports have suggested a figure as high as 20,000 . Mining accidents continue worldwide , including accidents causing dozens of fatalities at a time such as the 2007 Ulyanovskaya Mine disaster in Russia , the 2009 Heilongjiang mine explosion in China , and the 2010 Upper Big Branch Mine disaster in the United States . Mining has been identified by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ( NIOSH ) as a priority industry sector in the National Occupational Research Agenda ( NORA ) to identify and provide intervention strategies regarding occupational health and safety issues . The Mining Safety and Health Administration ( MSHA ) was established in 1978 to " work to prevent death , illness , and injury from mining and promote safe and healthful workplaces for US miners . " Since its implementation in 1978 , the number of miner fatalities has decreased from 242 miners in 1978 to 28 miners in 2015

QUERY_ANSWERS={'were massacred', 'Mudan incident'}
QUERY_CONTEXT=And Japan was eager to take every opportunity . In 1869 they took advantage of the defeat of the rebels of the Republic of Ezo to incorporate definitely the island of Hokkaido to Japan . For centuries , Japan viewed the Ryukyu Islands as one of its provinces . In 1871 the Mudan incident happened : cannibal Taiwanese aborigines murdered 54 Ryūkyūan sailors that had their ship shipwrecked . At that time the Ryukyu Islands were claimed by both Qing China and Japan , and the Japanese interpreted the incident as an attack on their citizens . They took steps to bring the islands in their jurisdiction : in 1872 the Japanese Ryukyu Domain was declared , and in 1874 a retaliatory incursion to Taiwan was sent , which was a success . The success of this expedition emboldened the Japanese : not even the Americans could defeat the Taiwanese cannibals in the Formosa Expedition of 1867 . Very few gave it much thought at the time , but this was the first move in the Japanese expansionism series . Japan occupied Taiwan for the rest of 1874 and then left owing to Chinese pressures , but in 1879 it finally annexed the Ryukyu Islands . In 1875 Qing China sent a 300-men force to subdue the Taiwanese cannibals , but unlike the Japanese the Chinese were routed , ambushed and 250 of their men were killed ; the failure of this expedition exposed once more the failure of Qing China to exert effective control in Taiwan , and acted as another incentive for the Japanese to annex Taiwan . Eventually , the spoils for winning the First Sino-Japanese War in 1894 included Taiwan

		ANSWER=Moscow Trials
		GOLD_MENTION=purges
		CONTEXT=While the accusation of lax security in the Kremlin was the pretext for humiliating Yenukidze , the real reason may have been his failure to contribute adequately to the glorification of Stalin . In particular , memoirs published in the 1920s , including Yenukidze 's , attribute the creation of the illegal printing press in Baku principally to the late Lado Ketskhoveli , and made no mention of Stalin , who was then based in Tiflis , being involved . He complained privately of being under pressure to change the record for Stalin 's benefit , saying : " I am doing everything he has asked me to do , but it is not enough for him . He wants me to admit that he is a genius . " On 16 January 1935 , Yenukdize was forced to publish a public apology , altering the record to say that Ketskhoveli was ' sent to Baku ' by Stalin and others to set up and to create the party organisation in Baku . Six months later , Beria published a history of the Bolshevik organisation in Transcaucasia which accused Yenukidze of having " deliberately and with hostile intent " falsified the record . Yenukidze was arrested on 11 February 1937 . During the purges , it was comparatively rare for the Soviet press to publicise executions , apart from those of the defendants at show trials . In a rare exception to this rule , it was reported in '' Pravda '' that Yenukdize and six others had been tried in private on 15 December 1937 , and executed on 20 December . His co-defendants were said to have been the Armenian diplomat , Lev Karakhan , the former Georgian party secretary Mamia Orakhelashvili , two former leading official from the North Caucasus , V.F.Larin and Boris Sheboldayev , the diplomat Vladimir Tsukerman , and the mysterious ' Baron ' Boris Steiger . During the largest of the Moscow Trials , in March 1938 , Yenukidze was posthumously denounced by one of the leading defendants , the former head of the NKVD , Genrikh Yagoda as the linchpin of the supposed ' rightist conspiracy ' and the principle organiser of the assassination of Kirov , and the supposed murder by poisoning of Maxim Gorky

		GOLD_MENTION=great purge
		CONTEXT=Immediately after the assassination of Sergey Kirov in Leningrad on 1 December 1934 , Agranov was entrusted with the organization of mass reprisals in the city . Stalin ordered him to fabricate a story that Lev Kamenev , Grigory Zinoviev and other leaders of the opposition were responsible for the murder , but seems to have resisted , whereupon Stalin entrusted Nikolai Yezhov to do it instead . In 1935 , he was ordered by Yezhov to track down and liquidate " an undiscovered centre of Trotskyists " in Moscow , as a preparatory step for the great purge that Stalin was planning . When Yezhov took over as head of the NKVD , Agranov remained his First Deputy , and in December 1936 was appointed Head of the Chief Directorate of State Security , which seemingly meant that he was to be trusted to purge the NKVD of officers Yezhov did not trust . In February 1937 , he circulated regional NKVD heads demanding names of Trotskyists and other oppositionists employed with the state security apparatus . In April , he was demoted to the post of regional NKVD chief in Saratov . He was arrested on 20 July 1937 , and appeared on the execution list of 1 November 1937 , in which his name was crossed out . He was executed by firing squad as an " enemy of the people " on 1 August 1938

The Blue Demons had lost 12 of their last 13 games , including a 79 – 46 blowout by Butler in their last regular-season game , and Georgetown was the decided favorite to win .

The teams traded leads until a Markel Starks jumper put the Hoyas ahead 40 – 36 with 12:22 to play , but DePaul came back and retook the lead at 43 – 40 with 9:16 remaining .

" Pointing to the main characters and plot elements , one pair of writers concluded that both '' Caravan of Courage '' and its sequel '' Battle for Endor '' are fairy tales despite occurring in a science fiction setting . They point to magical phenomena in both films , which is a fantasy element . They argue that in a science fiction story , the hero wants to disrupt or challenge the hierarchy of a supposed " utopian " society ; whereas in both Ewok films , society is not challenged or disputed . Additionally , they argue , that while the '' Star Wars '' saga also has fairy tale tropes , it adhered more towards science fiction .

It 's kind of exciting . " Writing in the '' Los Angeles Times '' , journalist Erin Aubry Kaplan noted the difference between Tarantino 's '' Jackie Brown '' and '' Django Unchained '' : " It is an institution whose horrors need no exaggerating , yet '' Django '' does exactly that , either to enlighten or entertain . A white director slinging around the n-word in a homage to '70s blaxploitation à la '' Jackie Brown '' is one thing , but the same director turning the savageness of slavery into pulp fiction is quite another . " While hosting NBC 's '' Saturday Night Live '' , Jamie Foxx joked about being excited " to kill all the white people in the movie " . Conservative columnist Jeff Kuhner wrote a reaction to the '' SNL '' skit for '' The Washington Times '' , saying : " Anti-white bigotry has become embedded in our postmodern culture . Take '' Django Unchained '' . The movie boils down to one central theme : the white man as devil — a moral scourge who must be eradicated like a lethal virus . " Samuel L. Jackson told Vogue Man that " '' Django Unchained '' was a harder and more detailed exploration of what the slavery experience was than '' 12 Years a Slave '' , but director Steve McQueen is an artist and since he 's respected for making supposedly art films , it 's held in higher esteem than '' Django '' , because that was basically a blaxploitation movie . " Some reviews criticized the film for being too violent . The originally planned premiere of '' Django '' was postponed following the Sandy Hook school shooting on December 14 , 2012 . Thomas Frank criticized the film 's use of violence as follows : Not surprisingly , Quentin Tarantino has lately become the focus for this sort of criticism ( about the relationship between the movies and acts of violence ) . The fact that '' Django Unchained '' arrived in theaters right around the time of the Sandy Hook massacre did n't help . Yet he has refused to give an inch in discussing the link between movie violence and real life . Obviously I do n't think one has to do with the other . Movies are about make-believe . It 's about imagination . Part of the thing is trying to create a realistic experience , but we are faking it . Is it possible that anyone in our cynical world credits a self-serving sophistry like this ? Of course an industry under fire will claim that its hands are clean , just as the NRA has done – and of course a favorite son , be it Tarantino or LaPierre , can be counted on to make the claim louder than anyone else . But do they really believe that imaginative expression is without consequence ? '' The Independent '' said the movie was part of " the new sadism in cinema " and added , " There is something disconcerting about sitting in a crowded cinema as an audience guffaws at the latest garroting or falls about in hysterics as someone is beheaded or has a limb lopped off "

Incidents of the Communist Party of Thailand ( CPT ) increasingly sabotages activities in rural areas across all of Thailand and of border clashes with Cambodia and Laos incidents frequent the news headlines . The administration forceful suppressive policy actually helped emboldened the CPT ’s popularity amongst the population . Furthermore , members and close aides of the royal family also became targets of attacks by the communist insurgents , as recorded in the assault of a helicopter assassinating the queen ’s secretary and a bomb explosion in same vicinity as the king while he was visiting the south of Thailand . The country-wide deterioration and increase activities of communist incidents induced actions among the Thai armed forces . The first attempt to overthrow the Thanin administration was led by General Chalad Hiranyasiri and took place in March 1977 where the coup was unsuccessful and Chalad was executed on Thanin 's order . With increasing unrest , the Thanin government was successfully overthrew when a group of Thai military called Young Turks asked the 1976 coup leader ( the coup that ousted the elected civilian government of Seni Pramoj and appointed the current royal favorite Thanin Kraivichien as prime minister ) General Sa-ngad Chaloyu and the Supreme Commander General Kriangsak Chomanan to oust Thanin on 20 October 1977 . Chomanan was later appointed as the new Prime Minister by a majority votes through both the National Assembly and the NARC , as a new Prime Minister has not yet been selected or volunteered . 8 As Prime Minister , Kriangsak moved to modurate and neutralize his predecessor Thanin Kraivichien 's severe measures , which had driven young Thai intellectuals from multiple universities to join Communist insurgencies in the countryside . In 1978 , in a major risk to his political position with his right leaning supporting base , he submitted an amnesty bill to the National Legislative Assembly to release the leftist students and labor activist Bangkok 18 , deemed to be wrongly jailed in 1976 , in the Thammasat University Massacre . The move have greatly bolstered his international position as a South East Asian humanitarian leader as noted by commemoration from many international bodies such as that expressed by letter of congratulations from US President Jimmy Carter and Assistant Secretary of State Patricia Derian , Chief State Department official responsible for human rights and humanitarian affairs . He also started a successful amnesty program for Communists as part of a reconciliation policy . 1 As Prime Minister , Kriangsak is widely credited for defusing a long-running communist insurgency in northern Thailand . He is reported to have met in 1979 with Deng Xiaoping , then supreme leader of the People 's Republic of China , allowing China to ship arms to the rebel Khmer Rouge in Cambodia in exchange for the PRC withdrawing its support for the communist insurgency in Thailand . These reports were confirmed contemporaneously by the Sunday Times and wire services . However , claims of a deal involving the Khmer Rouge was denied by the Thai government , which cites his offer of amnesty as the primary reason for the withdrawal of communist insurgency and policy of reunifications . The other benefit of the deal with China for Thailand was that it would not have Vietnamese troops on its border . In the same way Kriangsak had secret deals with rebel armies across the border in Burma , which provided a buffer zone against Burmese aggression
