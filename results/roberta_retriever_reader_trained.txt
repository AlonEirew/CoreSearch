		CONTEXT=Since the early 2000s , Sinai has been the site of several terror attacks against tourists , the majority of whom are Egyptian . Investigations have shown that these were mainly motivated by a resentment of the poverty faced by many Bedouin in the area . Attacking the tourist industry was viewed as a method of damaging the industry so that the government would pay more attention to their situation . ( See 2004 Sinai bombings , 2005 Sharm El Sheikh bombings and 2006 Dahab bombings ) . Since the 2011 Egyptian Revolution , unrest has become more prevalent in the area including the 2012 Egyptian-Israeli border attack in which 16 Egyptian soldiers were killed by militants . ( See Sinai insurgency . ) Also on the rise are kidnappings of refugees . According to Meron Estifanos , Eritrean refugees are often kidnapped by Bedouin in the northern Sinai , tortured , raped , and only released after receiving a large ransom

		CONTEXT=After the September 11 , 2001 attacks Bakri praised the attackers as " magnificent " , and changed his leanings towards the theology and philosophy of Al Qaeda . Bakri then stated that he had become a Salafi Muslim . Media outlets and British Muslims criticised him for his open support for various international jihadist organisations . On 13 September 2001 , Bakri told the '' Daily Mail '' , " When I first heard about the September 11 , 2001 attacks , there was some initial delight about such an attack . I received a phone call and said , ' Oh , wow , the United States has come under attack . ' It was exciting . " According to '' The Times '' , Bakri was left alone by British law prior to July 2005 despite actions such as an issuing a fatwa " containing a death threat against President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan " because : Bakri , who acts as al-Muhajiroun 's spiritual leader , insisted that his followers obey a " covenant of security " which , while encouraging terror abroad , forbade them from carrying out attacks in Britain . But " the authorities may have been lulled into a false sense of security " , because the covenant was not permanent . In November 2004 Bakri disbanded Al-Muhajiroun , saying that " all Muslims should unite together against a hostile West . " Three months later Bakri said this " covenant of security " was no longer in force having been violated by the British government . " Experts note , " according to the Times , that the July London bombings followed " four months later "

		ANSWER=Lockerbie bombing
		GOLD_MENTION=the Lockerbie bombing
		CONTEXT=On 4 October 2009 , Fred Halliday , Emeritus Professor of International Relations at the LSE and the School 's leading expert on the Middle East , wrote a memorandum to the LSE Council regarding the proposed cooperation with the Gaddafi Foundation . " I have repeatedly expressed reservations about formal educational and funding links with that country . " While those in favour of accepting the donation argued that " Libya is changing internally , " most informed observers agree that while some of the worst excesses for the moment have ceased , the rights of its people are badly protected . Libya " remains a country run by a secretive , erratic and corrupt elite . " Since 9/11 the Libyan government has reached compromises with the West on a number of issues , notably the Lockerbie bombing and nuclear weapons . Yet tactical changes in foreign policy are not sufficient for the purposes of evaluating political and academic links . There are also ways in which Libyan foreign policy has '' not '' changed : the country continues to call for the destruction of Israel ; Muammar Gaddafi recently called for the abolition of Switzerland , and he receives the leader of the Somali pirates operating off the Horn of Africa as honoured guests of state . Moreover , Libya 's handling of the Lockerbie bombing " has not been characterised by either consistency or clarity , " I have in the past , Halliday noted , defended accepting grants from authoritarian regimes such as the Gulf states , " but there should be clear limits on this , depending on the degree of political and human rights abuses perpetrated with them and on their ongoing foreign policy conduct . " Whitehall and the City are now happy to do business with Libya , but it does not follow that the LSE should do the same . Responsible leaders throughout the Middle East continue to express reservations regarding Libya , including " its more prominent ' liberal ' representatives . " We must remember , Halliday concluded , that the " liberal " wing within a regime such as Libya does not have the function of producing change but its role is instead " to reach compromises with internal hard-liners that serve to lessen external pressure . " A good case in point are the proposals LSE now is considering . It is , as LSE alumni in positions of responsibility in the region caution , " far too early for the School to take this step . " In 2009 , Human Rights Watch was allowed entry to Libya , via Saif al-Islam Gaddafi 's non-profit organization in order to gather facts about the human rights situation there . While HRW reported that there were concerns about the " repressive atmosphere , " they felt there were signs of " improvement " and Sarah Leah Whitson , director of HRW 's Middle East division said that one should not " underestimate the importance of the efforts made so far " by Gaddafi in the realm of human rights in Libya . She also wrote of her official visit that " the real impetus for the transformation rests squarely with a quasi-governmental organization , the Qaddafi Foundation for International Charities and Development " chaired by Gaddafi . She praised Gaddafi for establishing the country 's two semi-private newspapers , and said " it is impossible to underestimate the importance of the efforts made so far . Let 's hope this spring will last . " In January 2011 , HRW criticised other organisations as well as governments that had previously dealt with Gaddafi . HRW Business and Human Rights Director Arvind Ganesan condemned the London School of Economics ( LSE ) for allowing " abusive and corrupt officials or their families to launder their images in exchange for money " . This was later followed by Ganesen saying that " the London School of Economics did not act until Saif al-Islam 's father literally began to kill his own people " . According to NGO Monitor , this was despite the fact that David Held , Co-Director of LSE Global Governance , was partially influenced by Whitson 's remarks regarding her Libyan visit , referring to Saif al-Islam Gaddafi as a reformer

		CONTEXT=None of these claims was founded . In fact , the Imbaba church attacks took place on the same day a video was broadcast featuring Kamilia Shehata , one of these two Christian woman whom the Muslims claimed had converted to Islam and was being held hostage by the Coptic Church . In that video , Kamilia Shehata affirmed that she was Christian and had never converted to Islam . She also mentioned that everything the Salafis said about her were " lies " and " completely wrong facts " . Kamilia Shehata had been a major focus of Salafi activism since 2010 . They had organized several marches in Alexandria calling for her release and attacking Pope Shenouda III . They also threatened to attack churches in order to free her . On 29 April 2011 , about 2,000 Salafi Muslims protested outside the headquarters of the Coptic Orthodox Church in Saint Mark 's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral to demand the release of Kamilia Shehata . These claims of the Coptic Church holding Kamilia Shehata hostage were picked up by Al Qaida linked Islamic State of Iraq to justify their 2010 Baghdad church attack , which resulted in the massacre of 58 Christians in Iraq . The group also vowed more attacks until Kamilia was released . Two months later , on New Year 's Eve 2011 , a suicide bomber killed 23 Coptic Christians in the 2011 Alexandria bombing

		ANSWER=Distomo massacre
		GOLD_MENTION=Distomo massacre
		CONTEXT=Operation Steinadler ( 3 – 13 July 1944 ) was the last counter-insurgency operation carried out by German forces in Macedonia . Although wide in its scope it ultimately failed to achieve its objectives as ELAS fighters successfully evaded the German patrols , returning to their hideouts once the operation was over . The civilian population thus became the main target for Axis reprisals . Shortly afterwards the German 1st Mountain Division and the 4th SS Polizei Panzergrenadier Division departed from the country , while in August Army Group E declared Greece a war zone . German shops and cultural institutions were closed , while civilians and older member of the army , secret police and SS were evacuated . Under Adolf Hitler 's orders the Wehrmacht adopted the policy of total war , in response to the rise of ELAS subversive activity which had hampered the summer harvest in areas still controlled by the collaborationist government . Army Group E 's staff deemed the preceding Distomo massacre and 1 May 1944 Kaisariani executions as excessive and even damaging to the image of the occupational authorities . The staff stressed the need to arrest insurgents rather than resorting to the collective punishment of civilians . Nevertheless , those orders were disregarded and atrocities continued unhindered . Between June and August , ELAS attacks led to the death of 30 German soldiers , 14 were wounded and 9 more were missing in action . German reprisals in their turn included the execution of 254 people

		CONTEXT=In April 2011 , it was announced that part of Cashel Street was to reopen on 29 October 2011 . The date was set just prior to Cup and Show Week , where the Canterbury A&P Show is held in the week that coincides with the provincial anniversary day . The initiative was driven by the Restart The Heart Trust , which was set up for the purpose of getting retail back into the central city . The Restart The Heart Trust was given an interest-free loan of $ 3.36 million by the Christchurch Earthquake Appeal Trust . Temporary shops made from shipping containers were fitted out as retail premises , to accommodate 27 shops branded as Re : START . Ballantynes , Christchurch 's remaining department store , also reopened and is the retail anchor . Prime Minister John Key officiated at the opening ceremony . The original proponent of the concept , Paul Lonsdale of the Central City Business Association , became the manager of the mall initiative . Lonsdale and others initially claimed that it was the world first pop-up mall , but there were already container malls in other places , for example Cholula ( Mexico ) and Bishkek ( Kyrgyzstan ) . Organisers of the Christchurch mall project were threatened with legal action by organisers of a similar project in London ( Boxpark ) that was yet to open . Shipping containers were chosen because they were " strong " ( the mall was developed while Christchurch still experienced strong aftershocks , e.g. the June 2011 earthquake ) , and due to agreements with land owners , it may be necessary to relocate the mall to make way for building reconstruction . The initial 27 tenants were given six-months contracts

		CONTEXT=According to Brian Dunning researchers should be concerned about the fact that there are no documented " confirmed observations " of earthquake lights . It is a red flag that there is no consistency of what they are , when they happen and where they happen . It is likely that there " is not one , known , proven phenomenon " . However , a significant amount of video footage has surfaced since the advent of sites like YouTube that claim to represent this — one example being the 2017 Mexico earthquake — although no consistent explanation has been agreed upon . There is also a " staggering volume of literature ... hardly any of these papers agree on anything ... I 'm forced to wonder how many of these eager researchers are familiar with Hyman 's Categorical Imperative : ' Do not try to explain something until you are sure there is something to be explained ' " . Dunning 's final conclusion is that until there is " pending decent evidence " be skeptical of claims of earthquake lights

		CONTEXT=The 2003 Istanbul bombings provide the strongest implication of ties between IBDA-C and al-Qaeda , although the exact nature of their cooperation remains unclear . Al-Qaeda may have acted merely as an outside support base , or possibly in tandem with IBDA-C in terms of planning and execution . Some , on the other hand , assert that IBDA-C had no involvement at all ; contradicting reports from the Turkish media solely credit al-Qaeda with the attacks , implying that IBDA-C did not have the means to carry out such a sophisticated act of terrorism . Indeed , IBDA-C showed no willingness to exercise suicide terrorism prior to November 2003 . Regardless of whether or not IBDA-C actively participated in these particular attacks , the attention received provided the group with a heightened level of international infamy , as they were previously not well known at the global level

		ANSWER=Northridge , California earthquake
		GOLD_MENTION=Northridge , California earthquake
		CONTEXT=Having recorded in such a cutting edge fashion , Squire preferred the sound he got from his bass with the computer than previous digital tape systems that he had used . He played his Rickenbacker bass , a Tobias four-string bass , a custom made Mouradian bass , and Rabin 's Casio computer guitar that was run through a synthesiser . Early into the production of '' Talk '' , White said an initial 5.5 GB of space was insufficient due to the estimated 27 microphones used to record his drumming in real time and the decision to use more tracks for the drums in the final mix as opposed to condensing them . Until that point , each song was roughly 350 MB in size . In its unedited form , the album took up over 34 GB of memory . Production was delayed for a short while following the Northridge , California earthquake on 17 January 1994 to protect the equipment from damage caused by subsequent tremors . The album was then mastered by Stephen Marcussen at Precision Mastering in Los Angeles

		ANSWER=September 11 , 2001 attacks
		GOLD_MENTION=terrorist attacks
		CONTEXT=" Hunting for Witches " lyrics were influenced by the terrorist attacks on London 's transportation system in July 2005 , the September 11 , 2001 attacks in the United States , and the media 's reaction to the attacks . It also touches upon the amount of control the media has over modern society . Frontman Kele Okereke stated in an interview : The 30 bus in Hackney , which is just around the corner from where I live , was blown up . That song was written when I was just observing the reactions of the mainstream press in the UK and I was just amazed at how easy it 'd been to whip them up into a fury . ... I guess the point about the song for me is post-September 11th , the media has really traded on fear and the use of fear in controlling people . The music video for the song was the most minimalist one from the album . It simply features the band performing the song in a dark room , using some unique overhead shots in some parts of the video . The video is credited as being directed by Alan Smithee

		CONTEXT=The majority of reviews for '' Dark Horse '' were unfavourable and , in Leng 's description , " Simply Shady " was " much maligned " . Recalling the release in 2001 , '' Record Collector '' editor Peter Doggett paired the song with " Dark Horse " as the two tracks that most alienated Harrison 's fans due to the ravaged quality of his singing . In addition , as a chronicle of its author 's self-degradation , " Simply Shady " marked a departure from the standard subject matter of Harrison 's solo work . According to Leng , the song " shatter ed the ' Beatle George ' image " and so proved unwelcome amid the high expectations surrounding the concurrent tour , which was the first in North America by a former Beatle since the band 's 1966 tour

		ANSWER=1966 visit
		GOLD_MENTION=1966 visit
		CONTEXT=The 1974 tour was the first in North America by a former member of the Beatles since the band 's 1966 visit . Raising expectations further among fans and the media , it marked the first live performances by Harrison since his successful staging of the 1971 Concert for Bangladesh shows , which had also featured Shankar and Preston . Harrison had no wish to revisit his Beatles past , however , and he stated in the pre-tour press conference in Los Angeles : " it 's definitely not going to be a Bangladesh Mark II , if that 's what people are thinking . " At the same press conference , in reply to questions about a rumoured Beatles reunion , he said that his former band " were n't that good " , relative to musicians he had worked with since , and he dismissed the idea of ever being in a group with Paul McCartney again . According to author Peter Doggett , these remarks created " the same sense of shock " as John Lennon 's 1970 lyric " I do n't believe in Beatles " ( from the song " God " ) . Harrison biographer Simon Leng writes that the ensuing tour represented " a whirlwind of pent-up Beatlemania " in North America , " where the group had a status way beyond that of mere icons . " In his set list for the tour , Harrison included just four Beatles songs : his own compositions " Something " , " While My Guitar Gently Weeps " and " For You Blue " , and the Lennon – McCartney song " In My Life " . Aside from Scott and Preston , the musicians in Harrison 's band included the soul/R & B rhythm section of Willie Weeks and Andy Newmark , Scott 's L.A. Express bandmate Robben Ford ( on guitar ) , jazz percussionist Emil Richards , and horn players Jim Horn and Chuck Findley . Among Shankar 's orchestra of top Indian classical musicians were Alla Rakha , Shivkumar Sharma , Lakshmi Shankar , Hariprasad Chaurasia , L. Subramaniam and Sultan Khan . During the performances , the two groups performed both separately and as one , mirroring the East – West fusion of Shankar 's album '' Shankar Family & Friends ''

		GOLD_MENTION=Second Atlanta International Pop Festival
		CONTEXT=Duane Allman created the idea of having two lead guitarists , which was inspired by Curtis Mayfield ; " he wanted the bass , keyboards , and second guitar to form patterns behind the solo rather than just comping , " said Allman . Their style and incorporation of guitar harmonies was very influential on later musicians . " The pair also had a wide range of complementary techniques , often forming intricate , interlocking patterns with each other and with the bassist , Berry Oakley , setting the stage for dramatic flights of improvised melodies . " Dickey Betts ' playing was very melody-based ; " My style is just a little too smooth and round to play the blues stuff straight , because I 'm such a melody guy that even when I 'm playing the blues , I go for melody first , " he said . His listening of country and string bluegrass growing up influenced this considerably : " I played mandolin , ukulele , and fiddle before I ever touched a guitar , which may be where a lot of the major keys I play come from . " He later characterized their style as " question and answer , anticipation and conclusion , " which involved allowing each musician 's downbeat to arrive in a different spot , while also keeping consideration of the bass guitar lines . The group also held an improvisational approach to live performances , which connected the band with jam band culture . " Jazz and blues musicians have been doing this for decades , but I think they really brought that sense that anyone onstage can inspire anyone else at any given time to rock music , " said Haynes . " We sure did n't set out to be a " jam band " but those long jams just emanated from within the band , because we did n't want to just play three minutes and be over , " said Allman . '' Rolling Stone '' referred to the group as " without question the first great jam band , and they took the jam to heights that it had not previously reached . " The Allman Brothers Band were considerably influential within the Southern United States . Their arrival on the musical scene paved the way for several other notable Southern rock bands — among those Lynyrd Skynyrd , the Marshall Tucker Band and Wet Willie — to achieve commercial success , and also " almost single-handedly " made Capricorn Records into " a major independent label . " Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top , writing for '' Rolling Stone '' , wrote that the group " defined the best of every music from the American South in that time . They were the best of all of us . " He went on to call the band " a true brotherhood of players — one that went beyond race and ego . It was a thing of beauty . " The band 's extended popularity through heavy touring in the early 1990s created a new generation of fans , one that viewed the Allmans as pioneers of " latter-day collegiate jam rock . " AllMusic praised the band 's history : " they went from being America 's single most influential band to a shell of their former self trading on past glories , to reach the 21st century resurrected as one of the most respected rock acts of their era . " In 2012 , an official historic marker was erected on the site of the July 1970 Second Atlanta International Pop Festival near Byron , Georgia . The Allman Brothers Band had played two sets at the festival , which was a significant event in their career . The marker text reads , in part : " Over thirty musical acts performed , including ... Macon 's Allman Brothers Band on their launching pad to national fame . " Official sponsors of the marker included the Georgia Allman Brothers Band Association , The Allman Brothers Band Museum at the Big House , and '' Hittin ' the Note '' . In 2003 , the band released a recording of their festival opening and closing performances , '' Live at the Atlanta International Pop Festival : July 3 & 5 , 1970 ''

		CONTEXT=In addition to '' Skynyrd 's First And ...

Burns suffered a mental breakdown while on a particularly difficult tour with Lynyrd Skynyrd and left the band in 1974 , and was thus not involved in the infamous plane crash that killed three band members in 1977 . In 1996 , he participated in a performance to promote '' Freebird : The Movie '' . On March 13 , 2006 , he rejoined Lynyrd Skynyrd for one performance as he played alongside Gary Rossington , Billy Powell , Ed King , Artimus Pyle and the Honkettes at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction

In 1964 , Rounds and Jacobs had joined with another Honolulu entertainment entrepreneur , Tom Moffatt , to form Arena Associates . This company was responsible for bringing mainland music acts to the newly built Blaisdell Center . Mel Lawrence , who had co-produced both the Fantasy Fair and the Monterey festival the following week was also involved with the company . Chief among the financial backers of Arena Associates was Tom Driscoll , heir of the family that owned the Driscoll 's berry producing agricultural group . With the heavy backing of Driscoll , Rounds and Arena Associates produced several concerts . The most prominent of the events was the Miami Pop Festival , held in December 1968 at Gulfstream Park , a horse racing venue in South Florida . The festival , organized by Rounds , Lawrence , Jacobs , and a substantial promotional team , was hailed two weeks later in the New York Times as " a resounding success in both organization and programming , making it the first significant major pop festival held on the East Coast " .

The women 's magazine '' Bustle '' gave it a positive review , particularly certain vocal performances . '' Stereogum '' described the soundtrack music as eclectic in its influences , giving it a negative reception for " serving up earnest buoyancy in many high-fructose flavors . " Also noting the eclectic mix of musical genres , '' The Ringer '' writes that " the bombastic tunes mix EDM gleams with stadium-rock grunts , chest-pounding ballads with peppy empowerment anthems , a thoroughly modern and disconcertingly eager post-genre assault designed to barnstorm as many Spotify playlists as possible . It 's a gilded cheese ball , pushing exhilaration to the point of exhaustion .

The locality was later named in Arabic '' Qalʿat Abī Ṯawr '' ( " Castle of Abū Ṯawr " ) , which is the origin of the modern name . Others instead maintain that the name derives from the Arabic word " qal ' at " ( fortress ) and the Sicilian " vuturu " ( vulture ) meaning of " fortress of vultures . " The town existed under Byzantine rule pre Arab conquest as Aziz Ahmad in “ A Islamic History of Sicily ” ( edinburgh university press 1975 ) states that in 852 Abbas raided Caltavuturo in the northern part of the Island and took many prisoners who were sold as slaves , The town was the site of the so-called Caltavuturo massacre on 20 January 1893 , when local authorities killed 13 and wounded 21 peasants that had occupied communal land that they claimed was theirs

		CONTEXT=Perhaps the best known appearance of Cephalonia in popular culture is in the novel '' Captain Corelli 's Mandolin '' , by the English author Louis de Bernières . The book is believed to have been inspired by the village of Farsa , just outside Argostoli . The love story comprising the theme of the book is set before and after the Acqui Division massacre , during the Second World War . A film adaptation was released in 2001 . During filming there was lively debate between the production team , local authorities as well as groups of citizens , as to the complex historical details of the island 's antifascist resistance . As a result , political references were omitted from the film , and the romantic core of the book was preserved , without entering complex debates about the island 's history . In 2005 , Riccardo Milani made his TV movie , '' Cefalonia '' , also about the massacre , with music by Ennio Morricone

		CONTEXT=Operation Steinadler ( 3 – 13 July 1944 ) was the last counter-insurgency operation carried out by German forces in Macedonia . Although wide in its scope it ultimately failed to achieve its objectives as ELAS fighters successfully evaded the German patrols , returning to their hideouts once the operation was over . The civilian population thus became the main target for Axis reprisals . Shortly afterwards the German 1st Mountain Division and the 4th SS Polizei Panzergrenadier Division departed from the country , while in August Army Group E declared Greece a war zone . German shops and cultural institutions were closed , while civilians and older member of the army , secret police and SS were evacuated . Under Adolf Hitler 's orders the Wehrmacht adopted the policy of total war , in response to the rise of ELAS subversive activity which had hampered the summer harvest in areas still controlled by the collaborationist government . Army Group E 's staff deemed the preceding Distomo massacre and 1 May 1944 Kaisariani executions as excessive and even damaging to the image of the occupational authorities . The staff stressed the need to arrest insurgents rather than resorting to the collective punishment of civilians . Nevertheless , those orders were disregarded and atrocities continued unhindered . Between June and August , ELAS attacks led to the death of 30 German soldiers , 14 were wounded and 9 more were missing in action . German reprisals in their turn included the execution of 254 people

		CONTEXT=Roosevelt attended the 1884 GOP National Convention in Chicago and gave a speech convincing delegates to nominate African American John R. Lynch , an Edmunds supporter , to be temporary chair . Roosevelt fought alongside the Mugwump reformers ; however , Blaine , having gained support from Arthur 's and Edmunds 's delegates , won the nomination by 541 votes on the fourth ballot . In a crucial moment of his budding political career , Roosevelt resisted the demand of the Mugwumps that he bolt from Blaine . He bragged about his one small success : " We achieved a victory in getting up a combination to beat the Blaine nominee for temporary chairman ... To do this needed a mixture of skill , boldness and energy ... to get the different factions to come in ... to defeat the common foe . " He was also impressed by an invitation to speak before an audience of ten thousand , the largest crowd he had addressed up to that date . Having gotten a taste of national politics , Roosevelt felt less aspiration for advocacy on the state level ; he then retired to his new " Chimney Butte Ranch " on the Little Missouri River . Roosevelt refused to join other Mugwumps in supporting Grover Cleveland , the governor of New York and the Democratic nominee in the general election . He debated the pros and cons of staying loyal with his political friend , Henry Cabot Lodge . After Blaine won the nomination , Roosevelt had carelessly said that he would give " hearty support to any decent Democrat " . He distanced himself from the promise , saying that it had not been meant " for publication " . When a reporter asked if he would support Blaine , Roosevelt replied , " That question I decline to answer . It is a subject I do not care to talk about . " In the end , he realized that he had to support Blaine to maintain his role in the GOP , and he did so in a press release on July 19 . Having lost the support of many reformers , Roosevelt decided to retire from politics and move to North Dakota

		CONTEXT=Roosevelt attended the 1884 GOP National Convention in Chicago and gave a speech convincing delegates to nominate African American John R. Lynch , an Edmunds supporter , to be temporary chair . Roosevelt fought alongside the Mugwump reformers ; however , Blaine , having gained support from Arthur 's and Edmunds 's delegates , won the nomination by 541 votes on the fourth ballot . In a crucial moment of his budding political career , Roosevelt resisted the demand of the Mugwumps that he bolt from Blaine . He bragged about his one small success : " We achieved a victory in getting up a combination to beat the Blaine nominee for temporary chairman ... To do this needed a mixture of skill , boldness and energy ... to get the different factions to come in ... to defeat the common foe . " He was also impressed by an invitation to speak before an audience of ten thousand , the largest crowd he had addressed up to that date . Having gotten a taste of national politics , Roosevelt felt less aspiration for advocacy on the state level ; he then retired to his new " Chimney Butte Ranch " on the Little Missouri River . Roosevelt refused to join other Mugwumps in supporting Grover Cleveland , the governor of New York and the Democratic nominee in the general election . He debated the pros and cons of staying loyal with his political friend , Henry Cabot Lodge . After Blaine won the nomination , Roosevelt had carelessly said that he would give " hearty support to any decent Democrat " . He distanced himself from the promise , saying that it had not been meant " for publication " . When a reporter asked if he would support Blaine , Roosevelt replied , " That question I decline to answer . It is a subject I do not care to talk about . " In the end , he realized that he had to support Blaine to maintain his role in the GOP , and he did so in a press release on July 19 . Having lost the support of many reformers , Roosevelt decided to retire from politics and move to North Dakota

		ANSWER=1884 GOP National Convention
		GOLD_MENTION=GOP National Convention
		CONTEXT=Roosevelt attended the 1884 GOP National Convention in Chicago and gave a speech convincing delegates to nominate African American John R. Lynch , an Edmunds supporter , to be temporary chair . Roosevelt fought alongside the Mugwump reformers ; however , Blaine , having gained support from Arthur 's and Edmunds 's delegates , won the nomination by 541 votes on the fourth ballot . In a crucial moment of his budding political career , Roosevelt resisted the demand of the Mugwumps that he bolt from Blaine . He bragged about his one small success : " We achieved a victory in getting up a combination to beat the Blaine nominee for temporary chairman ... To do this needed a mixture of skill , boldness and energy ... to get the different factions to come in ... to defeat the common foe . " He was also impressed by an invitation to speak before an audience of ten thousand , the largest crowd he had addressed up to that date . Having gotten a taste of national politics , Roosevelt felt less aspiration for advocacy on the state level ; he then retired to his new " Chimney Butte Ranch " on the Little Missouri River . Roosevelt refused to join other Mugwumps in supporting Grover Cleveland , the governor of New York and the Democratic nominee in the general election . He debated the pros and cons of staying loyal with his political friend , Henry Cabot Lodge . After Blaine won the nomination , Roosevelt had carelessly said that he would give " hearty support to any decent Democrat " . He distanced himself from the promise , saying that it had not been meant " for publication " . When a reporter asked if he would support Blaine , Roosevelt replied , " That question I decline to answer . It is a subject I do not care to talk about . " In the end , he realized that he had to support Blaine to maintain his role in the GOP , and he did so in a press release on July 19 . Having lost the support of many reformers , Roosevelt decided to retire from politics and move to North Dakota

		ANSWER=April 1906 earthquake
		GOLD_MENTION=April 1906 earthquake
		CONTEXT=< ! -- When United States President Andrew Jackson allowed the charter of the Second Bank of the United States to expire in 1836 , the U.S. was without any sort of central bank , and the money supply in New York City fluctuated with the country 's annual agricultural cycle . Each autumn money flowed out of the city as harvests were purchased and — in an effort to attract money back — interest rates were raised . Foreign investors then sent their money to New York to take advantage of the higher rates . From the January 1906 Dow Jones Industrial Average high of 103 , the market began a modest correction that would continue throughout the year . The April 1906 earthquake that devastated San Francisco contributed to the market instability , prompting an even greater flood of money from New York to San Francisco to aid reconstruction . A further stress on the money supply occurred in late 1906 , when the Bank of England raised its interest rates , partly in response to UK insurance companies paying out so much to US policyholders , and more funds remained in London than expected . From their peak in January , stock prices declined 18 % by July 1906 . By late September , stocks had recovered about half of their losses

		CONTEXT=On 18 April 1906 a major earthquake hit San Francisco , and the resulting fires destroyed over 80 % of the city , killed thousands of people , and left half of the population homeless . Misled by local propaganda as to earthquake likelihood , few residents of San Francisco had bought earthquake insurance , but they had bought fire insurance . In the wake of the devastating fires following the earthquake , many insurance companies fought paying their policyholders , often by quibbling over causality ( since the insurance was not for earthquakes ) , or paying only 75 % of the amounts due . This led to many lawsuits from policyholders . At least 14 insurers went bankrupt , and some insurers – mostly German and Austrian – simply disappeared and denied all coverage

		CONTEXT=The name '' Devo '' comes from the concept of ' de-evolution ' — the idea that instead of continuing to evolve , mankind has actually begun to regress , as evidenced by the dysfunction and herd mentality of American society . In the late 1960s , this idea was developed as a joke by Kent State University art students Gerald Casale and Bob Lewis , who created a number of satirical art pieces in a devolution vein . At this time , Casale had also performed with the local band 15-60-75 ( The Numbers Band ) . They met Mark Mothersbaugh around 1970 , a talented keyboardist who had been playing with the band Flossy Bobbitt . Mothersbaugh brought a more humorous feel to the band , introducing them to material like the pamphlet " Jocko Homo Heavenbound " , which includes an illustration of a winged devil labelled " D-EVOLUTION " and would later inspire the song " Jocko Homo " . The " joke " about de-evolution became serious following the Kent State shootings of May 4 , 1970 . This event would be cited multiple times as the impetus for forming the band Devo . Throughout the band 's career , they would often be considered a " joke band " by the music press

		GOLD_MENTION=Distomo massacre
		CONTEXT=Operation Steinadler ( 3 – 13 July 1944 ) was the last counter-insurgency operation carried out by German forces in Macedonia . Although wide in its scope it ultimately failed to achieve its objectives as ELAS fighters successfully evaded the German patrols , returning to their hideouts once the operation was over . The civilian population thus became the main target for Axis reprisals . Shortly afterwards the German 1st Mountain Division and the 4th SS Polizei Panzergrenadier Division departed from the country , while in August Army Group E declared Greece a war zone . German shops and cultural institutions were closed , while civilians and older member of the army , secret police and SS were evacuated . Under Adolf Hitler 's orders the Wehrmacht adopted the policy of total war , in response to the rise of ELAS subversive activity which had hampered the summer harvest in areas still controlled by the collaborationist government . Army Group E 's staff deemed the preceding Distomo massacre and 1 May 1944 Kaisariani executions as excessive and even damaging to the image of the occupational authorities . The staff stressed the need to arrest insurgents rather than resorting to the collective punishment of civilians . Nevertheless , those orders were disregarded and atrocities continued unhindered . Between June and August , ELAS attacks led to the death of 30 German soldiers , 14 were wounded and 9 more were missing in action . German reprisals in their turn included the execution of 254 people

		CONTEXT=During the summer of 2011 , Valiquette turned down an offer to return to Lokomotiv Yaroslavl , due to a lack of guaranteed playing time . This proved fortunate for him , in light of the Lokomotiv Yaroslavl plane crash , which killed nearly the entire team and staff . Unsigned and not playing , it was announced in November 2011 that Valiquette , who runs a goalie school of his own , was taking a position at Quinnipiac University as the volunteer goalie coach for the men 's NCAA team . However , a couple of days later , the AHL 's Bridgeport Sound Tigers , for whom Valiquette had played while in the Islanders ' system , put out a call for an emergency backup , as they were shorthanded due to injuries with their Islanders parent club . Ultimately , Valiquette wound up not having to play for the Sound Tigers , and moved on to play for HC Valpellice of the Italian Serie A league , which in 14 games , he led in save percentage and goals against average . After his season at HC Valpellice , Valiquette signed with Swedish club Djurgården of the HockeyAllsvenskan league , but instead retired due to injury

" Press coverage states that " these bricks had come north from San Francisco as ballast on lumber ships . In the years after the 1906 quake , Fort Bragg sent tons of timber to the city to be used in rebuilding . Coming home , the ships used bricks from Bay Area factories for weight and for new construction in Fort Bragg . " Eventually , however , steam-powered vessels proved more dependable than sail , and railroads gained greater penetration of the coastal regions . Sailing vessels continued to compete with steamships and railroads well into the 20th century , but the last purpose-built sailing lumber schooner was launched in 1905

Burnham had previously contributed to plans for cities such as Cleveland ( the 1903 Group Plan ) , San Francisco ( 1905 ) , and Manila ( 1905 ) and Baguio in the Philippines , details of which appear in the 1909 '' Plan of Chicago '' publication . His plans for the redesign of San Francisco were delivered to the Board of Supervisors in September 1905 , but in the haste to rebuild the city after the 1906 earthquake and fires , Burnham ’s plans were ultimately ignored . In the Philippines , Burnham ’s Plan for Manila never materialized due to the outbreak of World War II and the relocation of the capital to another city after the war . Some components of the plan , however , did come into fruition including the shore road , which became Dewey Boulevard ( now known as Roxas Boulevard ) and the various neoclassical government buildings around Luneta Park , which very much resemble a miniature version of Washington , D.C. , in their arrangement

		ANSWER=Lockerbie bombing
		GOLD_MENTION=the Lockerbie bombing
		CONTEXT=On 4 October 2009 , Fred Halliday , Emeritus Professor of International Relations at the LSE and the School 's leading expert on the Middle East , wrote a memorandum to the LSE Council regarding the proposed cooperation with the Gaddafi Foundation . " I have repeatedly expressed reservations about formal educational and funding links with that country . " While those in favour of accepting the donation argued that " Libya is changing internally , " most informed observers agree that while some of the worst excesses for the moment have ceased , the rights of its people are badly protected . Libya " remains a country run by a secretive , erratic and corrupt elite . " Since 9/11 the Libyan government has reached compromises with the West on a number of issues , notably the Lockerbie bombing and nuclear weapons . Yet tactical changes in foreign policy are not sufficient for the purposes of evaluating political and academic links . There are also ways in which Libyan foreign policy has '' not '' changed : the country continues to call for the destruction of Israel ; Muammar Gaddafi recently called for the abolition of Switzerland , and he receives the leader of the Somali pirates operating off the Horn of Africa as honoured guests of state . Moreover , Libya 's handling of the Lockerbie bombing " has not been characterised by either consistency or clarity , " I have in the past , Halliday noted , defended accepting grants from authoritarian regimes such as the Gulf states , " but there should be clear limits on this , depending on the degree of political and human rights abuses perpetrated with them and on their ongoing foreign policy conduct . " Whitehall and the City are now happy to do business with Libya , but it does not follow that the LSE should do the same . Responsible leaders throughout the Middle East continue to express reservations regarding Libya , including " its more prominent ' liberal ' representatives . " We must remember , Halliday concluded , that the " liberal " wing within a regime such as Libya does not have the function of producing change but its role is instead " to reach compromises with internal hard-liners that serve to lessen external pressure . " A good case in point are the proposals LSE now is considering . It is , as LSE alumni in positions of responsibility in the region caution , " far too early for the School to take this step . " In 2009 , Human Rights Watch was allowed entry to Libya , via Saif al-Islam Gaddafi 's non-profit organization in order to gather facts about the human rights situation there . While HRW reported that there were concerns about the " repressive atmosphere , " they felt there were signs of " improvement " and Sarah Leah Whitson , director of HRW 's Middle East division said that one should not " underestimate the importance of the efforts made so far " by Gaddafi in the realm of human rights in Libya . She also wrote of her official visit that " the real impetus for the transformation rests squarely with a quasi-governmental organization , the Qaddafi Foundation for International Charities and Development " chaired by Gaddafi . She praised Gaddafi for establishing the country 's two semi-private newspapers , and said " it is impossible to underestimate the importance of the efforts made so far . Let 's hope this spring will last . " In January 2011 , HRW criticised other organisations as well as governments that had previously dealt with Gaddafi . HRW Business and Human Rights Director Arvind Ganesan condemned the London School of Economics ( LSE ) for allowing " abusive and corrupt officials or their families to launder their images in exchange for money " . This was later followed by Ganesen saying that " the London School of Economics did not act until Saif al-Islam 's father literally began to kill his own people " . According to NGO Monitor , this was despite the fact that David Held , Co-Director of LSE Global Governance , was partially influenced by Whitson 's remarks regarding her Libyan visit , referring to Saif al-Islam Gaddafi as a reformer

		ANSWER=Lockerbie bomber
		GOLD_MENTION=Lockerbie bomber
		CONTEXT=In September 2009 , the convicted Lockerbie bomber , Abdelbaset al-Megrahi was released from a Scottish prison on compassionate grounds . The Daily Telegraph revealed that Sikora was one of three different doctors hired by the Libyan government to report to them about Megrahi 's condition . Sikora 's report concluded that Megrahi had only 3 months to live due to terminal prostate cancer . In fact , Megrahi died on 20 May 2012 , two years and 9 months after his release . Sikora has since admitted that the " 3 months " timescale was suggested to him by the Libyans . According to the Daily Telegraph , this was not the first time that Sikora had been economical with the truth . Sikora 's medical diagnosis was not used by the Scottish Justice Minister since it had been paid for by Libya , but his diagnosis did agree with the medical evidence that '' was '' used . Once released , Megrahi returned to Libya and far outlived the 3-month prognosis . In July 2010 , in an interview with the Sunday Times , Sikora said that " it was 'em barrassing ' that Megrahi has lived much longer than expected . " and " There was always a chance he could live for ten years , 20 years . . . But it 's very unusual . " This quote was then used first by the UK press and then by a group of USA Senators to undermine the Scottish decision to release Megrahi on compassionate grounds , and then to link the release instead with BP contracts in Libya . In reply , the Scottish Government stated categorically that Sikora 's medical opinion was not used by the Scottish Justice Minister . Sikora has since complained about the way journalists have reported his views and stated that there was probably a less than 1 % chance of Megrahi living 10 years

		CONTEXT=Teresa soon becomes pregnant with a third child , but complications force Pedro to deal with the ensuing medical issues and their expense . He also begins to have moments of triumph playing local concerts and dances with the Copa Kings — as Pedro sings in his song " Quiero Brindar " , " I wan na drink to all I 've got and to all I 've accomplished . " Although earning a living as a band leader and musician proves difficult . For the locals , work in the fields depends on a good harvest , and construction work seems determined by inexplicable economic forces outside of their control . Pedro may , once again , be forced to confront the paradox that , " in order to feed their love ones , emigrants have to leave them behind . " Upon the film 's premiere at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival , the American trade reviews were predominantly positive . Johnathan Holland of '' Variety '' wrote that the film is a " quietly devastating exploration " of its subject and that " the script is beautifully observant of the stresses immigration places on family and self . " However , Neil Young of '' The Hollywood Reporter '' wrote that the film " surprisingly says little about the hot-button subjects it ambitiously sets out to explore . " . Ryan Lattanzio of '' Indiewire '' wrote that " In the vein of Ozu or even Apichatpong Weerasethakul , the film is composed of sublime fragments of life passing by " and concluded with the statement , " Peaceful , almost biblical and completely absorbing , this film is a masterpiece . " French critics were overwhelmingly positive on the film . Jacques Mandelbaum of '' Le Monde '' wrote that the film is " a remarkable first feature " by the director , and that " the deep love that binds this man and wife , the tricks the father uses to regain the look of his daughters , adolescents who are discreet and facetious in sweetly paying him the suffering of his remoteness , is all rendered with a delicacy and almost miraculous simplicity . " . Comparing the film to other Mexican cinema , Bruno Icher of '' Liberation '' writes that the film is " a new proposal , delicate and charming in a register intimate and almost quasi-documentary . " Telerama pointed out the film 's " humanistic approach , modest and sensitive to the North-South disequilibrium . " Film journal '' Positif '' noted that the film 's " attention to mise en scene makes the most quotidian situations touching

I think it 's good for me to take a break and reassess why I 'm doing it and how I 'm doing it . And I think this is probably a good way to learn about that .
