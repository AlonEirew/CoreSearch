QUERY_ANSWERS={'massive flood', 'Johnstown Flood of 1977', '1977 flood'}
QUERY_CONTEXT=The flood was preceded by rains from March 9 that did not stop until March 22 , 1936 . The storms brought warmer 50 °F ( 10 °C ) weather that was a cause of one stage of flooding and the continuous rains a second cause of flooding . The natural run-off of 1 to 3 inches ( 2.5 to 7.5 cm ) was far surpassed by the deluge of from 10 to 30 inches ( 25 to 75 cm ) of water in the region . The flood came before pending flood control legislation was enacted or any significant flood control measures implemented . The narrowness of the valleys and encroachment of buildings on the river banks contributed to record flooding . By the time nightfall came one-third of the city was under of water and by the time flooding was over twenty-five people lost their lives . The damages , estimated at $ 43 million , made it the worst flood since the flood of 1889 and the event is chronicled at the Johnstown Flood Museum After the flood , sweeping nationwide flood control laws were enacted and from 1938 to 1943 Johnstown saw many projects completed . These measures gave the people the feeling that the area was now " flood free " , and it was touted as such until the flood of 1977

		CONTEXT=Stinkfoot , a Comic Opera is an English musical with book , music , and lyrics by Vivian Stanshall and Ki Longfellow - Stanshall written for the Crackpot Theatre Company aboard the Old Profanity Showboat in Bristol , England . The show is based on a series of tales written by Longfellow about Stinkfoot , a New York City alley cat , a bit of a rogue and more than a bit of a rake . It had been intended for children , but when told by a New York City literary agent that " No mother in America would want her child identifying with Stinkfoot the alley cat , never mind its name , " the story went into a drawer for many years . It came out with the meeting in 1977 of Vivian and Ki , at which point the story became bedtime reading for Vivian 's son Rupert Stanshall ( born 1968 ) , and later for his daughter with Ki , Silky Longfellow - Stanshall ( born 1979 ) . In 1985 it “ grew up ” when Vivian and Ki decided to base a musical on its lead character , Stinkfoot . At that point , it became a melding of two very different visions and two very different musical traditions : Vivian 's days as frontman for the Bonzo Dog Band and his childhood in Leigh - on - Sea with Ki 's love of America ’s Broadway .

The following day , the United States also issued a travel warning to Americans to " take precautions in travel to the Sinai " and warned that " overland travel from Israel to the Sinai in particular is strongly discouraged . " Over the weekend prior to the attack on the border , various intelligence reports reaching the IDF 's Southern Command warned of an impending attack . Specific information regarding the time , target , and location of the attack could not be ascertained . Still , Southern Command Maj.-Gen . Tal Russo prepared his troops in case of an attack . Armored , Engineering , and Infantry soldiers were placed on high alert while the Israeli Air Force was deployed in the area as reinforcement .

QUERY_CONTEXT=In the 1959 review for '' Sight & Sound '' , David Vaughan calls '' Gigi '' " an elegant film " with a " cultivated visual taste which is everywhere apparent " . He summarises that " while '' Gigi '' does not represent a revival of the MGM musical in its heyday , it is a welcome extension of latter-day musical style in its adult subject-matter and its avoidance of spectacle made vulgar by emphasis on size . " He praises Minnelli 's talent for " the delicious amorality of the anecdote , but also the honesty and irony of its telling which have become foreign to the American cinema . " Vaughan points out " Chevalier 's practiced but irresistible charm as one of the film 's greatest assets " as well as " the brilliant high-comedy playing of Isabel Jeans , who as Aunt Alicia consummately portrays the distinction and beauty of a retired aristocrat of the '' demimonde '' . " Bosley Crowther of '' The New York Times '' called it " a musical film that bears such a basic resemblance to '' My Fair Lady '' that the authors may want to sue themselves " . He added , " But do n't think this point of resemblance is made in criticism of the film , for '' Gigi '' is a charming entertainment that can stand on its own two legs . It is not only a charming comprehension of the spicy confection of Colette , but it is also a lovely and lyrical enlargement upon that story 's flavored mood and atmosphere … Vincente Minnelli has marshaled a cast to give a set of performances that , for quality and harmony , are superb . " Abel Green of '' Variety '' called the film " 100 % escapist fare " and predicted it " is destined for a global box-office mop-up " . He added , " Alan Jay Lerner 's libretto is tailor-made for an inspired casting job for all principals , and Fritz Loewe 's tunes ( to Lerner 's lyrics ) already vie with and suggest their memorable '' My Fair Lady '' score … Miss Caron is completely captivating and convincing in the title role … Skillful casting , performance and presentation have endowed realism to the sum total … Director Minnelli 's good taste in keeping it in bounds and the general sound judgment of all concerned … distinguishes this Arthur Freed independent production . The Metrocolor rates recognition for its soft pastels under Joseph Ruttenberg 's lensing ; the Beaton costumes , sets and general production design are vivid physical assets at first sight . The skillful integration of words-and-music with the plot motivation makes this '' Gigi '' a very fair lady indeed as a boxoffice entry . " '' Time Out New York '' said , " The dominating creative contribution comes from Minnelli and Cecil Beaton … The combination of these two visual elitists is really too much — it 's like a meal consisting of cheesecake , and one quickly longs for something solid and vulgar to weigh things down . No doubt inspired by the finicky , claustrophobic sets and bric-à-brac , the cast tries ( with unfortunate success ) to be more French than the French , especially Chevalier . The exception is Gingold , who inhabits , as always , a world of her own . " '' TV Guide '' rated the film 3 ½ out of five stars , calling it " Overbaked but enjoyable , and a banquet for the eyes , thanks to the visual wonder of the Minnelli-Beaton teaming … Caron … leads the cast in a contest to see who can be the most French . The winner is Chevalier , in a performance that makes one feel as if you 're gagging on pastry … Perhaps if the sweetness of '' Gigi '' was contrasted with elements of honest vulgarity , the picture could balance itself out … Ten minutes into the movie , you 've resolved the plot and are left to wallow in lovely frou-frou . The film makes wonderful use of the usual Parisian landmarks , and benefits from extraordinary period costumes and sets . " '' Gigi '' won a record-breaking nine Academy Awards ( at the 1959 Oscars ceremony ) ; however , this record only lasted for one year , as '' Ben-Hur '' broke this record the following year with 11 Oscars . In tribute to '' Gigi '' s domination of the Oscars , the MGM switchboard answered calls the following day with " M-Gigi-M " . '' Gigi '' , eventually along with 1987 's '' The Last Emperor '' , held the record as the film ( s ) with the most Academy Award wins in every category in which it was nominated , until 2003 's '' The Lord of the Rings : The Return of the King '' broke the record at the 2004 Oscars ceremony with 11 Oscar nominations and 11 Oscar wins

		CONTEXT=Critical opinion regarding the film has been overwhelmingly positive . '' The Village Voice '' critic J. Hoberman , who in 1981 included the film in his list of the ten best films commercially released in the United States during that year , more recently wrote that the film is one " of the richest avant-garde features of the 1970s " and praised its " winning combination of sexual frankness and visual wit , " while another critic , Dennis Schwartz , wrote that the " film 's beauty is derived from its sexual frankness and playfully drawn out intimate relationship scenes , witty use of photography , and its originality as it breaks free of conventional unities of body , space and time . Export skillfully edits montage and integrates video , still photography , and performance art with elements from Cubism , Surrealism , Dada and avant-garde cinema . " '' Artforum '' noted in November 1980 that " w atching their scenes together , we realize how seldom , if ever before , the details of sexual intimacy have been shown in film from the point of view from a woman . Export privileges rupture over unity and never settles for one-dimensional solutions " and it was called one " of the most original films in this year 's exposition " and a " tour de force of cinematic invention " grounded in the director 's " fresh and intelligent sensibility , characteristically self-referential . Her visual resources include mirrors , still photography , video , dance , and films within the film , all employed with a bold and surprising inventiveness " by the catalogue notes of the 1978 Los Angeles International Film Exposition . Similarly , critic Alison Butler wrote that the " film is a witty and visually brilliant essay on gender and experience , culture and environment " and program notes used by the San Francisco Cinematheque during a screening quote critic Amy Taubin as opining that the film " makes you reconsider what you and everyone else is doing — in life and in art " and critic Steve Anker underscoring that it is an important " crossover film " combining " avant-garde and theatrical sensibilities , made during the mid-1970s . It chronicles the nightmarish breakdown of a fashion photographer as she confronts her waning identity and security as a career woman ; blending narrative experimentation , fantasy , fact and theoretical critique , it has enormous impact on independent features which followed it . " PopMatters noted that the film has " enough originality to nag at patient viewers and get at least partially under our skin " and critic Michael Atkinson wrote that it is a " weird , restless , beguilingly offbeat bit of dreamwork . " The film was presented for the first time at the Berlin International Film Festival in 1977 , it has won a Special Jury Prize at the Venice Film Festival and was recently called " seminal " during a screening at a repertory cinema , " a strong and humoristic showdown " at another and " a sonically-complex , montage-rich , darkly funny and uriniferous cornerstone of avant-garde cinema " during a screening at a New York University class . Critic Peter Hajek wrote in the Austrian newspaper '' Kurier '' that " Valie Export presents this psychopanoptic view of the present in solid , striking images and often in unexpected humorous passages . " Critic Chris Holmlund , author of the scholarly article " Feminist Makeovers : The Celluloid Surgery of Valie Export and Su Friedrich , " referred to '' Invisible Adversaries '' as a feminist version of '' Invasion of the Body Snatchers '' , noted that the film includes references to famous paintings and to '' Un Chien Andalou '' , and wrote that therefore it " is visually rick , entertaining , striking , but also demanding . " A few reviews , however , were negative . For example , London 's '' Time Out '' wrote about the film that it is " n ot unlike '' W.R. : Mysteries of the Organism '' " and that it will " probably age as badly " and a reviewer for '' The Heights '' wrote that " I was expecting a great feminist work here , but got mediocrity . I can not recommend that you see this film , " though he nevertheless praised the film as a " cornucopia of video spectacle in which Export delights , confounds and amuses the audience with her antics .

In previous years , countries that received a top 10 placing were automatically granted a spot in the next year 's final without having to compete in a semi-final , but for 2008 , the EBU changed the automatic qualification regulations so that all countries except the " Big 4 " ( France , Germany , Spain , and the United Kingdom ) and host country , would have to pass through one of two semi-finals . The EBU split up countries with a friendly voting history into separate semi-finals , to give a better chance for other countries to win . Greece and Cyprus had often been accused of favoring each other , with each awarding the other the maximum number of points ( twelve ) at the previous contest . On January 28 , 2008 , the EBU held a special draw which determined that Greece would be in '' Semi-final 1 '' held on May 20 , 2008 in Belgrade , Serbia ; Cyprus was subsequently placed in the second semi-final

		CONTEXT=Although Greece had been granted a spot in the 2008 final because of its seventh-place finish at the Eurovision Song Contest 2007 , it had to compete in a semi-final for the first time since 2004 because of new rules put into effect by the European Broadcasting Union ( EBU ) . In previous years , countries that received a top 10 placing were automatically granted a spot in the next year 's final without having to compete in a semi-final , but for 2008 , the EBU changed the automatic qualification regulations so that all countries except the " Big 4 " ( France , Germany , Spain , and the United Kingdom ) and host country , would have to pass through one of two semi-finals . The EBU split up countries with a friendly voting history into separate semi-finals , to give a better chance for other countries to win . Greece and Cyprus had often been accused of favoring each other , with each awarding the other the maximum number of points ( twelve ) at the previous contest . On January 28 , 2008 , the EBU held a special draw which determined that Greece would be in '' Semi-final 1 '' held on May 20 , 2008 in Belgrade , Serbia ; Cyprus was subsequently placed in the second semi-final

QUERY_CONTEXT=Duane Allman created the idea of having two lead guitarists , which was inspired by Curtis Mayfield ; " he wanted the bass , keyboards , and second guitar to form patterns behind the solo rather than just comping , " said Allman . Their style and incorporation of guitar harmonies was very influential on later musicians . " The pair also had a wide range of complementary techniques , often forming intricate , interlocking patterns with each other and with the bassist , Berry Oakley , setting the stage for dramatic flights of improvised melodies . " Dickey Betts ' playing was very melody-based ; " My style is just a little too smooth and round to play the blues stuff straight , because I 'm such a melody guy that even when I 'm playing the blues , I go for melody first , " he said . His listening of country and string bluegrass growing up influenced this considerably : " I played mandolin , ukulele , and fiddle before I ever touched a guitar , which may be where a lot of the major keys I play come from . " He later characterized their style as " question and answer , anticipation and conclusion , " which involved allowing each musician 's downbeat to arrive in a different spot , while also keeping consideration of the bass guitar lines . The group also held an improvisational approach to live performances , which connected the band with jam band culture . " Jazz and blues musicians have been doing this for decades , but I think they really brought that sense that anyone onstage can inspire anyone else at any given time to rock music , " said Haynes . " We sure did n't set out to be a " jam band " but those long jams just emanated from within the band , because we did n't want to just play three minutes and be over , " said Allman . '' Rolling Stone '' referred to the group as " without question the first great jam band , and they took the jam to heights that it had not previously reached . " The Allman Brothers Band were considerably influential within the Southern United States . Their arrival on the musical scene paved the way for several other notable Southern rock bands — among those Lynyrd Skynyrd , the Marshall Tucker Band and Wet Willie — to achieve commercial success , and also " almost single-handedly " made Capricorn Records into " a major independent label . " Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top , writing for '' Rolling Stone '' , wrote that the group " defined the best of every music from the American South in that time . They were the best of all of us . " He went on to call the band " a true brotherhood of players — one that went beyond race and ego . It was a thing of beauty . " The band 's extended popularity through heavy touring in the early 1990s created a new generation of fans , one that viewed the Allmans as pioneers of " latter-day collegiate jam rock . " AllMusic praised the band 's history : " they went from being America 's single most influential band to a shell of their former self trading on past glories , to reach the 21st century resurrected as one of the most respected rock acts of their era . " In 2012 , an official historic marker was erected on the site of the July 1970 Second Atlanta International Pop Festival near Byron , Georgia . The Allman Brothers Band had played two sets at the festival , which was a significant event in their career . The marker text reads , in part : " Over thirty musical acts performed , including ... Macon 's Allman Brothers Band on their launching pad to national fame . " Official sponsors of the marker included the Georgia Allman Brothers Band Association , The Allman Brothers Band Museum at the Big House , and '' Hittin ' the Note '' . In 2003 , the band released a recording of their festival opening and closing performances , '' Live at the Atlanta International Pop Festival : July 3 & 5 , 1970 ''

		CONTEXT=In a positive review for '' Cuepoint '' , Robert Christgau argued that while Azalea may never demonstrate a powerful , soulful , or attractively melodic delivery , her " striving Australian-Atlantan cadence " is original and carries every song . He deemed ' ' The New Classic '' " plenty authentic -- and damn good to boot " while dismissing Azalea 's media naysayers : " predictably , the songs where she expresses wonderment that ' Impossible Is Nothing ' are more relatable than the ones where she flaunts her liquid assets . But the ones where she pledges to keep on striving are more relatable than that , because striving is built into her flow itself . That 's what her complexity is about . " Phil Johnson from '' The Independent '' called it " an instantly engaging showcase of the 23-year-old Aussie 's talents – poppy without diluting her fierce-flowing charisma . " Kellan Miller of '' XXL '' said despite some poor songs near the end of the record , it is " a persuasive indicator that Iggy Azalea will be around for the long haul . " '' The New Classic '' was named one of the best hip-hop albums of the year by '' XXL '' on a list published on 30 June 2014 , adding that " the album proved to a gang of skepts who doubted Iggy 's controversial style from the start that she was more than capable of making hip-hop tracks with a pop appeal . " It was placed at number twenty-five on Digital Spy 's top albums of 2014 and listed among Fuse 's 40 best albums of 2014 . The album won the Breakthrough Artist Release award at the 2014 ARIA Music Awards and Favorite Rap/Hip-Hop Album at the 2014 American Music Awards , beating out Drake 's '' Nothing Was the Same '' and Eminem 's '' The Marshall Mathers LP 2 '' . It received a nomination for Best Rap Album at the 57th Grammy Awards . The album was also up for Top Rap Album at the 2015 Billboard Music Awards

QUERY_CONTEXT=According to many scholars , the name and origin of the town are traced back to the period of Arab rule . According to Ibn al-Athir ( '' The Complete History '' , VII .370.5 – 7 ) , in AH 268 ( 881/82 CE ) , the Aghlabid commander Abū Ṯawr was defeated by the Byzantines ( probably commanded by the '' strategos '' Mosilikes ) and his was army annihilated , with only seven men surviving . The locality was later named in Arabic '' Qalʿat Abī Ṯawr '' ( " Castle of Abū Ṯawr " ) , which is the origin of the modern name . Others instead maintain that the name derives from the Arabic word " qal ' at " ( fortress ) and the Sicilian " vuturu " ( vulture ) meaning of " fortress of vultures . " The town existed under Byzantine rule pre Arab conquest as Aziz Ahmad in “ A Islamic History of Sicily ” ( edinburgh university press 1975 ) states that in 852 Abbas raided Caltavuturo in the northern part of the Island and took many prisoners who were sold as slaves , The town was the site of the so-called Caltavuturo massacre on 20 January 1893 , when local authorities killed 13 and wounded 21 peasants that had occupied communal land that they claimed was theirs

		ANSWER=Arab massacres of 1929
		GOLD_MENTION=massacres of 1929
		CONTEXT=After the 1920 Arab riots and 1921 Jaffa riots , the Jewish leadership in Palestine believed that the British ( whom the League of Nations had given a mandate over Palestine in 1920 for the purpose of establishing a Jewish national home ) had no desire to confront local Arab gangs over their attacks on Palestinian Jews . Realizing that they could not rely on the British administration for protection from these gangs , the Jewish leadership created the Haganah to protect their farms and Kibbutzim . In addition to guarding Jewish communities , the role of the Haganah was to warn the residents of and repel attacks by Palestinian Arabs . In the period between 1920 – 1929 , the Haganah lacked a strong central authority or coordination . Haganah " units " were very localized and poorly armed : they consisted mainly of Jewish farmers who took turns guarding their farms or their kibbutzim . Following the Arab massacres of 1929 , the Haganah 's role changed dramatically . It became a much larger organization encompassing nearly all the youth and adults in the Jewish settlements , as well as thousands of members from the cities . It also acquired foreign arms and began to develop workshops to create hand grenades and simple military equipment , transforming from an untrained militia to a capable underground army

		GOLD_MENTION=Minoan eruption
		CONTEXT=About Minoan warfare , Branigan concluded : Archaeologist Olga Krzyszkowska agreed : " The stark fact is that for the prehistoric Aegean we have no direct evidence for war and warfare '' per se '' . " Between 1935 and 1939 , Greek archaeologist Spyridon Marinatos posited the Minoan eruption theory . An eruption on the island of Thera ( present-day Santorini ) , about from Crete , occurred during the LM IA period ( 1550 – 1500 BC ) . One of the largest volcanic explosions in recorded history , it ejected about of material and was measured at 7 on the Volcanic Explosivity Index . The eruption devastated the nearby Minoan settlement at Akrotiri on Santorini , which was entombed in a layer of pumice . Although it is believed to have severely affected the Minoan culture of Crete , the extent of its effects has been debated . Early theories proposed that volcanic ash from Thera choked off plant life on the eastern half of Crete , starving the local population ; however , more-thorough field examinations have determined that no more than of ash fell anywhere on Crete . Based on archaeological evidence , studies indicate that a massive tsunami generated by the Thera eruption devastated the coast of Crete and destroyed many Minoan settlements . Although the LM IIIA ( late Minoan ) period is characterized by affluence ( wealthy tombs , burials and art ) and ubiquitous Knossian ceramic styles , by LM IIIB Knossos ' wealth and importance as a regional center apparently declined

After the war it was proved that his testimony was false

In one incident in the 2010 preseason he was removed from training and verbally reprimanded by club leadership when he was deemed unfit to train after a big night out . Despite these struggles , his on-field development was such that he would still debut in the 2010 season 's opening match , a 56-point Richmond loss against at the MCG . Martin recorded the sixth most disposals of any Tiger ( 18 ) to go along with four marks , three tackles and three clearances . Two weeks later Martin was convicted by the AFL tribunal for a high hit on Sydney 's Josh Kennedy in round 3 . He did not receive a suspension for the incident however , returning to football the following week . After four matches Martin ranked fourth in the league for clearances and eighth for hard-ball gets . Media reports emerged after round 8 that the 18 year old Martin had received a significant contract offer from expansion club the Greater Western Sydney Giants . The offer , which the Herald Sun ’s Mark Robinson claimed to be worth $ 2.4 million over three seasons , would have taken effect in the new club 's first AFL season in 2012 . Martin later said he had never entertained the idea of moving to the start-up club . In round 10 he had gained attention for his on-field efforts again , this time being nominated for the 2010 AFL Rising Star award after a 21 disposal and 11 clearance match against Port Adelaide . Due to his previous tribunal conviction however , Martin was ruled ineligible for the award and thus did not officially place in the end of season award 's points tally . He drew the attention of Sydney coach Paul Roos by round 14 , prompting Roos to send veteran Brett Kirk onto Martin in a tagging role . Despite this extra attention , he still managed to record 18 disposals and a goal in the match at the MCG . After 17 rounds Martin ranked second at the club for clearances and inside 50s as well as third for disposals and contested possessions . At the same time he ranked first among that season 's Rising Star nominees in clearances , contested possessions and inside 50s . He was also fourth for average disposals and fifth for average tackles . In round 19 he was rested by the club before returning to play out the final five matches of the season . He missed just that one game in his debut season and finished the year ranked second at Richmond for clearances and inside 50s , as well as third for both contested possessions and disposals . In addition to winning the Fred Swift Medal for fourth place at the club 's best and fairest night , Martin also received six votes in the Brownlow Medal count that year , the most by any Richmond debutant since Craig Lambert in 1988 . At season 's end he reiterated his commitment to the club ( and rejection of the former GWS overtures ) by signing a two-year contract extension that would keep him at Richmond until the end of the 2013 season .

" Wasikowska portrayed a nineteen-year-old Alice returning to Wonderland for the first time in over a decade after fleeing from an unwanted marriage proposal . Her affinity for the character played a part in her desire for the role , as she had read the Lewis Carroll books as a child and was a fan of Jan Švankmajer 's 1988 stop-motion film '' Alice '' . She considered Burton 's film as a chance to explore a deeper characterisation of Alice , to whom she felt young women her age could relate , saying : " Alice has a certain discomfort within herself , within society and among her peers ; I ... have definitely felt similarly about all of those things , so I could really understand her not fitting in . Alice also is an observer who is thinking a lot , and that 's similar to how I am . " For Lisa Cholodenko 's indie comedy '' The Kids Are All Right '' , Wasikowska was cast as Joni , the bookish daughter of a lesbian couple ( Annette Bening and Julianne Moore ) who was conceived via artificial insemination . At her younger brother 's ( Josh Hutcherson ) request , she seeks out their biological father ( Mark Ruffalo ) . During shooting , she successfully campaigned to have Joni wear pajamas in several home scenes . She explained to '' Orlando Sentinel '' film critic Roger Moore , " Joni 's very comfortable in her place , with who she is . So I pushed to have her , whenever she was at home , in her pajamas . That ’s comfortable ! And that ’s something I do . " On 25 October , Wasikowska was honored with the Hollywood Awards ' Breakthrough Actress Award , which was presented to her by Bryce Dallas Howard , and she won the Australian Film Institute International Award for Best Actress on 12 December for her performance in '' Alice in Wonderland '' . According to '' Forbes '' , '' Alice in Wonderland '' was amongst the highest-grossing films of 2010 with $ 1.025 billion . As of June 2018 , it is the 31st-highest-grossing film of all time

		GOLD_MENTION=Mnet Asian Music Awards
		CONTEXT=2NE1 's first extended play '' 2NE1 '' ( 2009 ) was preceded by two singles . The first one , " Lollipop " , was recorded with label mate Big Bang and released on March 27 , 2009 to promote the LG Cyon phone . Though a music video was filmed , " Lollipop " was not promoted due to its product advertisement affiliation , which caused issues with the network chart eligibility . The second single , " Fire " , written and produced by 1TYM 's Teddy Park , was released that May and contained elements of hip-hop and reggae . Its music video had two versions — a " space " version and a " street " version . Within the first 24 hours of release , the videos each received over one million views . Both the song " Fire " and the group became popular online search terms . The final single , " I Do n't Care " , was released simultaneously alongside their first eponymous EP in July . Promotional activities quickly followed to demonstrate a softer , more feminine image of the group to contrast the edgier image previously portrayed in " Fire " . " I Do n't Care " became the most downloaded song of that month , later winning Song of the Year at the Mnet Asian Music Awards . Although group members recorded and released their own solo materials in August , they performed a reggae version of " I Do n't Care " on '' Inkigayo '' in September . Due to the remix 's popularity , it was released to digital outlets on September 3 as their next digital single . Buoyed by the success of their singles , sales of '' 2NE1 '' totaled 100,000 copies by the end of the year . 2NE1 later performed at the 6th Asia Song Festival , representing Korea alongside three other groups and later winning the Asian Newcomer 's award . In 2010 , 2NE1 unexpectedly released " Try to Follow Me " in February through various digital outlets without any prior announcement or promotion to support the Samsung 's Corby Folder . The song peaked at number one on the Gaon Digital Chart . That summer , 2NE1 traveled to Los Angeles and London to record English songs for an American debut album with The Black Eyed Peas 's member and music producer will.i.am . The group recorded a total of 10 songs in their initial sessions . The quartet 's first full-length album , '' To Anyone '' ( 2010 ) , was released on September 9 , and debuted at number 7 on the Billboard World Album Chart . Prior to the release of the album , it had already received 120,000 preorders . Containing a total of 12 tracks , four singles were released : the top five hits " Clap Your Hands " , " Ca n't Nobody " , " It Hurts ( Slow ) " and the chart-topping " Go Away " . A fifth song " Do n't Stop the Music " was recorded as a " special gift for Thai fans " and was also used in conjunction with the group 's Yamaha Fiore endorsement . At the 2010 Mnet Asian Music Awards , 2NE1 took home the most accolades : " Artist of the Year " , " Best Music Video " for " Ca n't Nobody " , " Best Female Group " , and " Album of the Year " award

		CONTEXT=He arrived at the club as an incredibly shy and underdeveloped personality , a fact that was noted by teammate Trent Cotchin who said though Martin was 18 “ he seemed much younger in some of the ways he behaved . ” Indeed , he struggled initially to adjust to the expectations of professional football . In one incident in the 2010 preseason he was removed from training and verbally reprimanded by club leadership when he was deemed unfit to train after a big night out . Despite these struggles , his on-field development was such that he would still debut in the 2010 season 's opening match , a 56-point Richmond loss against at the MCG . Martin recorded the sixth most disposals of any Tiger ( 18 ) to go along with four marks , three tackles and three clearances . Two weeks later Martin was convicted by the AFL tribunal for a high hit on Sydney 's Josh Kennedy in round 3 . He did not receive a suspension for the incident however , returning to football the following week . After four matches Martin ranked fourth in the league for clearances and eighth for hard-ball gets . Media reports emerged after round 8 that the 18 year old Martin had received a significant contract offer from expansion club the Greater Western Sydney Giants . The offer , which the Herald Sun ’s Mark Robinson claimed to be worth $ 2.4 million over three seasons , would have taken effect in the new club 's first AFL season in 2012 . Martin later said he had never entertained the idea of moving to the start-up club . In round 10 he had gained attention for his on-field efforts again , this time being nominated for the 2010 AFL Rising Star award after a 21 disposal and 11 clearance match against Port Adelaide . Due to his previous tribunal conviction however , Martin was ruled ineligible for the award and thus did not officially place in the end of season award 's points tally . He drew the attention of Sydney coach Paul Roos by round 14 , prompting Roos to send veteran Brett Kirk onto Martin in a tagging role . Despite this extra attention , he still managed to record 18 disposals and a goal in the match at the MCG . After 17 rounds Martin ranked second at the club for clearances and inside 50s as well as third for disposals and contested possessions . At the same time he ranked first among that season 's Rising Star nominees in clearances , contested possessions and inside 50s . He was also fourth for average disposals and fifth for average tackles . In round 19 he was rested by the club before returning to play out the final five matches of the season . He missed just that one game in his debut season and finished the year ranked second at Richmond for clearances and inside 50s , as well as third for both contested possessions and disposals . In addition to winning the Fred Swift Medal for fourth place at the club 's best and fairest night , Martin also received six votes in the Brownlow Medal count that year , the most by any Richmond debutant since Craig Lambert in 1988 . At season 's end he reiterated his commitment to the club ( and rejection of the former GWS overtures ) by signing a two-year contract extension that would keep him at Richmond until the end of the 2013 season . The extension was reported by the Herald Sun to be in the vicinity of $ 400,000-a-year

It got so bad when we toured for '' Slippery When Wet '' that there were times I was freaking out … We indulged in everything that was on offer . But it was n't real , and what I wanted above all else was to be given credit for the work I put into the songs and into the recording … The problem was that I did n't notice how the image overtook what we were about . " Of the omission of recordings from this tour from '' One Wild Night Live 1985 – 2001 '' , Jon Bon Jovi remarked : " It makes sense for the '' Slippery '' tour not to be represented , because at that time I was dosed up on cortisone and my voice was shot .

		CONTEXT=Prior to '' Unexcpected '' s release , Williams told MTV that she could n't " wait for the world to hear her new solo album " , describing it as " fresher " , " more inspirational " , and " more on the secular side " . Furthermore , she stated " whether it 's gospel or not , I wrote about it " , therefore expecting " some of her gospel fans to be a little upset " but wanted to " keep it real " . She also discussed one of the album 's primary themes – " what it 's like to be in love " – explaining " I talk about mistakes you make when you 're in love and how they affect your life " after saying " I was able to experience some things this year and I wrote about them . " In describing the album during another interview , this time for '' GospelCity '' , Williams said " these songs are just about the real me " and that she " just wrote from her heart " before acknowledging that " it did n't turn out to be as ' gospel-ly ' as some would have liked " , but " the stuff " that 's on the album " is stuff she went through " . Williams then said " this whole album is about God 's love and me " . After being asked " Michelle , as people listen to the album , Do You Know , as they get acquainted with the songs , what are you hoping to bring to their lives ? " , Williams responded " That everybody live in peace and not settle for anything less than what the Lord wants to bring your way . I know what I went through , I know God is taking me to another level . I had people around me that were not going where I was going – I had to release them from my life . " Critical reviews of the album were generally favorable . Kwaku of '' Cross Rhythms '' wrote that " Michelle seems happy to produce music which straddles between contemporary gospel and inspirational R&B " and thus " she certainly is n’t going to have problems facing the congregation when she attends church " . Sony of '' Gospel City '' described the album as a " beautifully written ... very wonderfully produced gospel album that in some places is a throwback to a Duke Ellington jazz minuet , in others it 's a fast paced hip-hop laced gospel after-party , and in others it 's a beautiful testimony of a woman at the well " He then went on to comment that " the true highlight of this album is Michelle 's unique , yet beautiful , timbre and her magnificent song writing . " Caroline Sullivan of '' The Guardian '' however gave a more mixed review , commenting that '' Do You Know ? '' " does n't provide the running start " that Williams " needs " . She then noted that " Williams 's strength is a shimmery jazz lilt . Emily Sogn of '' PopMatters '' likened Williams ' " pleasingly slow paced " singing style to pop contemporaries like Ashanti and Janet Jackson and described the album as " a decent , yet not spectacular sophomore effort " , noting that " while it might not enough to ensure her a successful career outside of her contributions to Destiny 's Child , it is n’t without its particular merits and shining moments " . '' People '' magazine commented that " there is a contemporary R&B sound " to the album " that would n't be out of place on secular radio " and noted that " The Movement " " has a hip-hop vibe , while glossy ballads like " The Way of Love " sound like they could be Destiny 's Child slow jams " . '' Entertainment Weekly '' editor Chris Willman rated the album B - and highlighted the artistic growth on the album . Comparing it to its predecessor he wrote " this second solo foray into contemporary spirituals vastly improves upon her godforsaken 2002 debut " and that " both the beats and girlish chops feel more seasoned , even if she 'll always be more R&B minimalist than the gospel powerhouse she aspires to be " . AllMusic wrote that " working with a wide array of producers ... Williams is subtly more up-tempo than on her debut . " The staff found that the songs " all point to an artist with a considerable amount of self-assurance . Not surprisingly , Williams is never far from the roots that extend back to her day job in Destiny 's Child . " First released on January 26 , 2004 , '' Do You Know '' preceded the release of Destiny 's Child 's fourth and final regular studio album '' Destiny Fulfilled '' , making Williams the only member of the group to release more than one solo album in the group 's hiatus . Williams promoted the album during various TV appearances and live performances , some of the most notable include ; live performances of " Do You Know " ( the album 's first single ) and " Purpose In Your Storm " on various '' TBN '' programs and a live performance of a newly arranged version of " The Way of Love " on '' Regis & Kelly '' . Notably , Williams also performed " Do You Know " live on the 2004 Soul Train Music Awards and throughout the '' Destiny Fulfilled ... And Lovin ' It '' world concert tour – which visited 16 countries throughout Australia , Asia , Europe , and North America with 67 dates in total . A video and audio recording of one such performance of " Do You Know " , recorded in Atlanta was included on the '' Destiny 's Child : Live in Atlanta '' 2006 DVD release , which has since been re-issued on Blu-ray .

She also discussed one of the album 's primary themes – " what it 's like to be in love " – explaining " I talk about mistakes you make when you 're in love and how they affect your life " after saying " I was able to experience some things this year and I wrote about them . " In describing the album during another interview , this time for '' GospelCity '' , Williams said " these songs are just about the real me " and that she " just wrote from her heart " before acknowledging that " it did n't turn out to be as ' gospel-ly ' as some would have liked " , but " the stuff " that 's on the album " is stuff she went through " . Williams then said " this whole album is about God 's love and me " . After being asked " Michelle , as people listen to the album , Do You Know , as they get acquainted with the songs , what are you hoping to bring to their lives ? " , Williams responded " That everybody live in peace and not settle for anything less than what the Lord wants to bring your way . I know what I went through , I know God is taking me to another level . I had people around me that were not going where I was going – I had to release them from my life . " Critical reviews of the album were generally favorable . Kwaku of '' Cross Rhythms '' wrote that " Michelle seems happy to produce music which straddles between contemporary gospel and inspirational R&B " and thus " she certainly is n’t going to have problems facing the congregation when she attends church " . Sony of '' Gospel City '' described the album as a " beautifully written ... very wonderfully produced gospel album that in some places is a throwback to a Duke Ellington jazz minuet , in others it 's a fast paced hip-hop laced gospel after-party , and in others it 's a beautiful testimony of a woman at the well " He then went on to comment that " the true highlight of this album is Michelle 's unique , yet beautiful , timbre and her magnificent song writing . " Caroline Sullivan of '' The Guardian '' however gave a more mixed review , commenting that '' Do You Know ? '' " does n't provide the running start " that Williams " needs " . She then noted that " Williams 's strength is a shimmery jazz lilt . Emily Sogn of '' PopMatters '' likened Williams ' " pleasingly slow paced " singing style to pop contemporaries like Ashanti and Janet Jackson and described the album as " a decent , yet not spectacular sophomore effort " , noting that " while it might not enough to ensure her a successful career outside of her contributions to Destiny 's Child , it is n’t without its particular merits and shining moments " . '' People '' magazine commented that " there is a contemporary R&B sound " to the album " that would n't be out of place on secular radio " and noted that " The Movement " " has a hip-hop vibe , while glossy ballads like " The Way of Love " sound like they could be Destiny 's Child slow jams " . '' Entertainment Weekly '' editor Chris Willman rated the album B - and highlighted the artistic growth on the album . Comparing it to its predecessor he wrote " this second solo foray into contemporary spirituals vastly improves upon her godforsaken 2002 debut " and that " both the beats and girlish chops feel more seasoned , even if she 'll always be more R&B minimalist than the gospel powerhouse she aspires to be " . AllMusic wrote that " working with a wide array of producers ... Williams is subtly more up-tempo than on her debut . " The staff found that the songs " all point to an artist with a considerable amount of self-assurance . Not surprisingly , Williams is never far from the roots that extend back to her day job in Destiny 's Child . " First released on January 26 , 2004 , '' Do You Know '' preceded the release of Destiny 's Child 's fourth and final regular studio album '' Destiny Fulfilled '' , making Williams the only member of the group to release more than one solo album in the group 's hiatus . Williams promoted the album during various TV appearances and live performances , some of the most notable include ; live performances of " Do You Know " ( the album 's first single ) and " Purpose In Your Storm " on various '' TBN '' programs and a live performance of a newly arranged version of " The Way of Love " on '' Regis & Kelly '' . Notably , Williams also performed " Do You Know " live on the 2004 Soul Train Music Awards and throughout the '' Destiny Fulfilled ... And Lovin ' It '' world concert tour – which visited 16 countries throughout Australia , Asia , Europe , and North America with 67 dates in total . A video and audio recording of one such performance of " Do You Know " , recorded in Atlanta was included on the '' Destiny 's Child : Live in Atlanta '' 2006 DVD release , which has since been re-issued on Blu-ray . " Do You Know " was also promoted with the filming and release of a music video for the song

		CONTEXT=Safety has long been a concern in the mining business , especially in sub-surface mining . The Courrières mine disaster , Europe 's worst mining accident , involved the death of 1,099 miners in Northern France on March 10 , 1906 . This disaster was surpassed only by the Benxihu Colliery accident in China on April 26 , 1942 , which killed 1,549 miners . While mining today is substantially safer than it was in previous decades , mining accidents still occur . Government figures indicate that 5,000 Chinese miners die in accidents each year , while other reports have suggested a figure as high as 20,000 . Mining accidents continue worldwide , including accidents causing dozens of fatalities at a time such as the 2007 Ulyanovskaya Mine disaster in Russia , the 2009 Heilongjiang mine explosion in China , and the 2010 Upper Big Branch Mine disaster in the United States . Mining has been identified by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ( NIOSH ) as a priority industry sector in the National Occupational Research Agenda ( NORA ) to identify and provide intervention strategies regarding occupational health and safety issues . The Mining Safety and Health Administration ( MSHA ) was established in 1978 to " work to prevent death , illness , and injury from mining and promote safe and healthful workplaces for US miners . " Since its implementation in 1978 , the number of miner fatalities has decreased from 242 miners in 1978 to 28 miners in 2015

QUERY_CONTEXT=And Japan was eager to take every opportunity . In 1869 they took advantage of the defeat of the rebels of the Republic of Ezo to incorporate definitely the island of Hokkaido to Japan . For centuries , Japan viewed the Ryukyu Islands as one of its provinces . In 1871 the Mudan incident happened : cannibal Taiwanese aborigines murdered 54 Ryūkyūan sailors that had their ship shipwrecked . At that time the Ryukyu Islands were claimed by both Qing China and Japan , and the Japanese interpreted the incident as an attack on their citizens . They took steps to bring the islands in their jurisdiction : in 1872 the Japanese Ryukyu Domain was declared , and in 1874 a retaliatory incursion to Taiwan was sent , which was a success . The success of this expedition emboldened the Japanese : not even the Americans could defeat the Taiwanese cannibals in the Formosa Expedition of 1867 . Very few gave it much thought at the time , but this was the first move in the Japanese expansionism series . Japan occupied Taiwan for the rest of 1874 and then left owing to Chinese pressures , but in 1879 it finally annexed the Ryukyu Islands . In 1875 Qing China sent a 300-men force to subdue the Taiwanese cannibals , but unlike the Japanese the Chinese were routed , ambushed and 250 of their men were killed ; the failure of this expedition exposed once more the failure of Qing China to exert effective control in Taiwan , and acted as another incentive for the Japanese to annex Taiwan . Eventually , the spoils for winning the First Sino-Japanese War in 1894 included Taiwan

		CONTEXT=He established himself in Chicago , where in the great fire of 1871 he lost everything he possessed . In 1875 , he moved to New York City , finding work on the '' Century '' ( then '' Scribners '' ) magazine . Cole was associated with the magazine for 40 years as a pioneer craftsman of wood engraving . He immediately attracted attention by his unusual facility and his sympathetic interpretation of illustrations and pictures , and his publishers sent him abroad in 1883 to engrave a set of blocks after the old masters in the European galleries . These achieved for him a brilliant success . His reproductions of Italian , Dutch , Spanish , Flemish and English pictures were published in book form with appreciative notes by the engraver himself . '' Old Dutch and Flemish Masters '' was one of the books that Cole had contributed his wood engravings . Though the advent of new mechanical processes had rendered wood engraving almost a lost art and left practically no demand for the work of such craftsmen , Mr Cole was thus enabled to continue his work , and became one of the foremost contemporary masters of wood engraving . He received a medal of the first class at the Paris Exhibition of 1900 , and the only grand prize given for wood engraving at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition at St Louis , Missouri , in 1904 . In 1906 he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate Academician , and became a full Academician in 1908 . His son , Alphaeus Philemon Cole , was a noted portraitist who is also today recognized as having been the worlds oldest verified living man at the time of his death

		CONTEXT=The National Hardwood Lumber Association ! Founded ! Abbreviation ! Headquarters ! Industry ! Website The National Hardwood Lumber Association ( NHLA ) was founded on April 8th , 1898 in Chicago , Illinois to establish uniformity of inspecting hardwood lumber . The NHLA is now a membership-based trade association that serves two main purposes : to stimulate economic activity and to provide a vehicle for the members to collectively strive for mutual benefit . The NHLA has continued to be a national voice for the hardwood industry . Due to the Great Fire of 1871 , NHLA was unable to erect their own offices in 1898 , therefore they first established themselves in a dimly lit office of the Chicago Hardwood Lumber Exchange , where the first meeting of the 37 founders took place on April 8 , 1898 . The cities represented at this meeting were Cincinnati , OH ; Chicago , IL ; Boston , MA ; Minneapolis , MN ; Memphis , TN ; Cairo , IL ; St. Louis , MO ; and Racine , WI . This array of attendance showed the critical situation which was threatening the industry through lack of uniform grading rules . William A. Bennett of Bennett & Witte Company was elected the first President of NHLA and immediately appointed a committee to draft the first rules for inspection . The first Rules Committee met with 59 firms and nine markets represented , and the committee established the first standardized set of hardwood lumber grading rules

		CONTEXT=Following the release of the MHRC report , Matas accused MHRC vice-chairwoman Yvonne Peters of taking a contradictory position , stating that : " So what they 're saying is that a full investigation is warranted even when there 's no evidence , as long as the accusation is within the jurisdiction of the board . There 's a lot of problems with this . What basically happened is that Siddiqui heard a rumour . She makes a complaint , as a result of which the commission goes on a five-year fishing expedition . They do n't find anything . We 're co-operating with them . And then they dismiss the complaint . That 's not a proper procedure , in my view . " Matas also criticized the procedures of the MHRC , stating that they will " take an allegation , without evidence , and just run with it to see if it 's true . " The previous year , Matas in a submission in a Moon Report on Internet hate speech , Matas charged that Canada 's human rights commissions have demonstrated " a disastrous combination of investigative zeal and substantive ignorance . " Although Matas stated that he does not believe Siddiqui acted in bad faith , he added that : " The people who run these procedures have to have a more objective viewpoint than the people who make the complaint . " In July 2009 , B'nai Brith Canada issued a press release denouncing Carleton University for hiring Hassan Diab , who was alleged by French authorities to have been responsible for the 1980 Paris synagogue bombing . Diab was living under virtual house arrest at the time ( he had been granted bail but under very strict conditions ) due to an extradition request from France . Diab , who has denied any involvement with the synagogue bombing , has not been convicted of any crime . Within a few hours of the B'nai Brith Canada complaint , Carleton University announced that it would " immediately replace the current instructor , Hassan Diab " in order to provide students " with a stable , productive academic environment that is conducive to learning . " B'nai Brith executive vice-president Frank Dimant later stated that " the university did the right thing .

They took steps to bring the islands in their jurisdiction : in 1872 the Japanese Ryukyu Domain was declared , and in 1874 a retaliatory incursion to Taiwan was sent , which was a success . The success of this expedition emboldened the Japanese : not even the Americans could defeat the Taiwanese cannibals in the Formosa Expedition of 1867 . Very few gave it much thought at the time , but this was the first move in the Japanese expansionism series . Japan occupied Taiwan for the rest of 1874 and then left owing to Chinese pressures , but in 1879 it finally annexed the Ryukyu Islands . In 1875 Qing China sent a 300-men force to subdue the Taiwanese cannibals , but unlike the Japanese the Chinese were routed , ambushed and 250 of their men were killed ; the failure of this expedition exposed once more the failure of Qing China to exert effective control in Taiwan , and acted as another incentive for the Japanese to annex Taiwan . Eventually , the spoils for winning the First Sino-Japanese War in 1894 included Taiwan

		CONTEXT=Northwestern University Woman ’s Medical School is a defunct American medical school for the professional education of women . Located in Chicago , Illinois , it was organized in 1870 as the Woman 's Hospital Medical College of Chicago , and it was in close connection with the Chicago Hospital for Women and Children . In 1879 , it severed its connection with the hospital and took the name of the Woman 's Medical College of Chicago . Co-education of the sexes , in medicine and surgery , was experimentally tried from 1868 to 1870 , but the experiment proved repugnant to the male students , who unanimously signed a protest against the continuance of the system . The result was the establishment of a separate school for women in 1870 , with a faculty of sixteen professors . The requirements for graduation were fixed at four years of medical study , including three annual graded college terms of six months each . The first term opened in the autumn of 1870 , with an attendance of twenty students . The original location of the school was in the " North Division " of Chicago , in temporary quarters . After the fire of 1871 a removal was effected to the " West Division , " where ( in 1878 - 79 ) a modest , but well arranged building was erected . A larger structure was built in 1884 . In 1891 or 1892 , the institution became part of the Northwestern University , and changed title to Northwestern University Woman 's Medical School . The university closed the college in 1902 . The college , in all its departments , was organized along the lines of the best medical schools of the country . In 1896 , there were twenty - four professorships , all capably filled , and among the faculty are some of the best known specialists in the country .

There were minimal mishaps , with only Hamilton and Timo Glock spinning . Jarno Trulli spent the majority of the session in the pits with gearbox problems , completing only two laps

		GOLD_MENTION=2009 Christmas Day attempted airplane bombing
		CONTEXT=Jasser has said that he and his family have helped build a number of small mosques in different cities using locally raised funds , and at times encountering , but always overcoming local opposition . In 2010 Jasser strongly opposed the building of the Park51 project , a 13-story Islamic community center and mosque two blocks from the World Trade Center site , which is also known as Ground Zero . He said he was concerned that the funding of the $ 100 million project might be coming from foreign Islamist sources , and also said : " Ground Zero is purely about being American . It can never be about being Muslim . " Jasser believes acts of Islamic terrorism are rooted in the ideology of political Islam or Islamism . He has expressed the opinion that the 2009 Christmas Day attempted airplane bombing , the 2009 Fort Hood shooting , and the 2010 Times Square car bombing attempt have not prodded the United States into the appropriate action , but rather have resulted in politically correct denial by U.S. government authorities , and inaction by most American Muslims . He believes that even the Bush administration took inadequate measures against Islamism in America . He says the U.S. needs to provide alternatives for Muslim youth and promote reformist groups . In his television appearances , Jasser has claimed that 3 to 5 percent of U.S. Muslims are militant and 30 to 40 percent do not believe in separation of mosque and state . He also states that he believes many Western Muslim imams are too timid in their response to Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant seemingly both criticizing but also sympathizing with its goal of a caliphate stating " Clearly , the majority of the mosques in the United States are led by imams who are Islamists — who believe that in Muslim-majority countries that the state should be identified as an Islamic state . " Jasser is an outspoken supporter of Israel and believes that Muslim organizations and leaders need to be held to a litmus test to see whether they recognize Israel as a state . Jasser and a group of American Muslims founded the nonprofit American Islamic Forum for Democracy ( AIFD ) in 2003 with the goal of demonstrating the compatibility of Islam with democracy and American values . Jasser is the group 's president and chief spokesman . The AIFD supports separation of religion and state , religious pluralism , equality of the sexes , the unconditional recognition of Israel , and the creation of an independent Palestine " on the current ' occupied territories . ' " The organization rejects terrorism and any justification for it
