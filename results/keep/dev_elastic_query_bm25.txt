By the early 1990s , Johnstown abandoned most of its steel production , although some limited fabrication work continues

During filming there was lively debate between the production team , local authorities as well as groups of citizens , as to the complex historical details of the island 's antifascist resistance . As a result , political references were omitted from the film , and the romantic core of the book was preserved , without entering complex debates about the island 's history .

In previous years , countries that received a top 10 placing were automatically granted a spot in the next year 's final without having to compete in a semi-final , but for 2008 , the EBU changed the automatic qualification regulations so that all countries except the " Big 4 " ( France , Germany , Spain , and the United Kingdom ) and host country , would have to pass through one of two semi-finals . The EBU split up countries with a friendly voting history into separate semi-finals , to give a better chance for other countries to win . Greece and Cyprus had often been accused of favoring each other , with each awarding the other the maximum number of points ( twelve ) at the previous contest . On January 28 , 2008 , the EBU held a special draw which determined that Greece would be in '' Semi-final 1 '' held on May 20 , 2008 in Belgrade , Serbia ; Cyprus was subsequently placed in the second semi-final

		CONTEXT=The album was tentatively due to be released in May 2012 , but was later announced with an official release date of December 4 , 2012 . It was originally expected to be released near the end of 2011 but the delay between albums was because Kesha wanted to try to make an album that could shift the sound of pop music into a more rock direction . While being interviewed by the '' Calgary Herald '' she explained the delay and elaborated on this , stating : " I want to take enough time to make sure it 's the reinvention of pop music . That 's the ultimate goal , to reinvent pop music . So I 'm planning on taking as much time as I need , but May sounds about right . " In the summer of 2013 , Kesha embarked on a co-headlined tour with Pitbull . The tour , North American Tour 2013 , travelled across North America , hitting venues in the United States and Canada .

		CONTEXT=The Japanese invasion of Taiwan ( ) ( May – October 1895 ) was a conflict between the Empire of Japan and the armed forces of the short - lived Republic of Formosa following the Qing Dynasty 's cession of Taiwan to Japan in April 1895 at the end of the First Sino - Japanese War . The Japanese sought to take control of their new possession , while the Republican forces fought to resist Japanese occupation . The Japanese landed near Keelung on the northern coast of Taiwan on 29 May 1895 , and in a five - month campaign swept southwards to Tainan . Although their advance was slowed by guerrilla activity , the Japanese defeated the Formosan forces ( a mixture of regular Chinese units and local Hakka militias ) whenever they attempted to make a stand . The Japanese victory at Baguashan on 27 August , the largest battle ever fought on Taiwanese soil , doomed the Formosan resistance to an early defeat . The fall of Tainan on 21 October ended organised resistance to Japanese occupation , and inaugurated five decades of Japanese rule in Taiwan .
