		CONTEXT=While traditional " stop and frisk " dragnets have largely fallen into disuse , New York 's strategy for controlling serious crime by stopping many of those loitering in areas where such loitering is thought to be associated with lesser crimes has been called a dragnet . Similarly , controversy remains over other activities held to be dragnets as well . An active area of legal controversy , for example , is that of warrant-less wiretaps . If all cell phones are monitored by machine for certain words or phrases thought to be associated with terrorism , and the results used to cue focused investigations , the ACLU argues that this constitutes a kind of dragnet . There was a large , highly publicized dragnet in Boston after the 2013 marathon race bombing .

		CONTEXT=In a May 2005 column in the '' Weekly Standard '' , Daveed Gartenstein-Ross wrote about his May 14 , 2005 , debate with Bray on PAX-TV 's Faith Under Fire program . He noted that a '' Chicago Tribune '' article had detailed how the fundamentalist Islamist Muslim Brotherhood operates in the US through MAS , and that MAS wants to see the US governed by sharia law . He noted that MAS , " except in its most public of statements " , was open about its agenda . He argued that while Bray " tries to portray MAS as an organization that embraces these shared liberal democratic values , the group simultaneously teaches its members that all government should become Islamic and that non-Islamic judicial systems should be boycotted . " In July 2005 , after the London bombings that killed 52 people , Bray said : " Let me say to the terrorists very clearly , that you will have no comfort in our community . Our community offers you no harbor . Our message is clear , you do no service to Islam , you do a great disservice to Islam and for the love of God , stop this madness . " When the '' Philadelphia Inquirer '' published some of the cartoons of Mohammed in the 2005 Mohammed cartoons controversy , Bray said : " This has nothing to do with free speech ; its pure sensationalism that reeks of religious disrespect . What the '' Philadelphia Inquirer '' has done is irresponsible , provocative , and reckless . " When in November 2006 , two imams from Boston-area mosques were arrested and charged with being involved in a scheme that secured religious worker visas for immigrants who instead got secular jobs , Bray said : " If this was sic clerics who were anything other than Muslims , would they have had to face this ? " After the September 2007 resignation of Esam Omeish from a Virginia Commission on Immigration , after it was revealed that he had publicly endorsed " the jihad way " in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict , Bray said " What 's the big news ? Everybody knows Muslims feel passionately about the Palestinian issue . What in the world is wrong about talking about the invasion of Lebanon or the plight of the Palestinian people ? " Bray served on the Board of Directors of the Interfaith Alliance and the National Interfaith Committee for Worker Justice , and is a National Co-convener of Religions for Peace-USA . He is a Washington , DC , television and radio talk show host , and has appeared on CBS News , Fox , MSNBC , CNN , C-SPAN , Aljazeera , and many TV and radio talk shows . Bray also organized protests against the U.S. war in Afghanistan , the Iraq war , and the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza

		CONTEXT=The UK government had investigated expelling Bakri even before the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 , and in July 2003 the headquarters of al-Muhajiroun , and the homes of Bakri and Choudary , were raided by the police . The following year , under new anti-terrorist legislation , the government announced that it wanted to ban al-Muhajiroun . In 2005 Bakri learned that he was at risk of prosecution for his support of the 7 July 2005 London bombers , and in August left the UK for Lebanon , where he claimed that he was on holiday . After leaving a television station where he said " I will not return to Britain unless I want to go there as a visitor or as a tourist " , he was detained by Lebanon 's general security department and held in a Beirut prison . Several days later , Bakri was excluded from returning to Britain by the Home Secretary , Charles Clarke , on the grounds that his presence in Britain was " not conducive to the public good . " Choudary condemned the decision and demanded to know what Bakri had done to justify the ban . He claimed that ministers were inventing rules to ensure that Bakri could not return . In November , Choudary and three other followers of Bakri were deported from Lebanon and returned to the UK . Choudary blamed the Foreign and Commonwealth Office for orchestrating their deportations , claiming that the four were there to help Bakri set up a madrasah

		GOLD_MENTION=2010 Times Square car bombing attempt
		CONTEXT=The overall ineffective and illegitimate result of the war on terror means that the costs have thus far outweighed the successes . Counter-terrorism efforts such as Targeted killing and drone strikes have backfired and are not proven to work , and have even perpetuated the number of terrorist attacks , including suicide bombings . While counter-terrorism may deter some attacks , it can not prevent all , and often has the result of provoking rather than reducing terrorism . The Iraq War was not productive in countering terrorism . Upward of 60 examples of terrorist incidents in America are proven consequences of United States foreign policy and military intervention . Still , no academic scholar in orthodox terrorism studies has considered American military intervention as the primary problem . It is noted that at Faisal Shahzad 's trial – following his failed 2010 Times Square car bombing attempt – he cited the drones that were killing the people of his community as the reason for his vengeance . Unmanned drone attacks in Afghanistan and Pakistan tend to target public places and gatherings , such as weddings and funerals , and are increasing the threat of terrorism . Violence emanates and results from counterinsurgency/terrorism . What America calls preventative war , the Middle East calls state terrorism

		CONTEXT=The UK government had investigated expelling Bakri even before the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 , and in July 2003 the headquarters of al-Muhajiroun , and the homes of Bakri and Choudary , were raided by the police . The following year , under new anti-terrorist legislation , the government announced that it wanted to ban al-Muhajiroun . In 2005 Bakri learned that he was at risk of prosecution for his support of the 7 July 2005 London bombers , and in August left the UK for Lebanon , where he claimed that he was on holiday . After leaving a television station where he said " I will not return to Britain unless I want to go there as a visitor or as a tourist " , he was detained by Lebanon 's general security department and held in a Beirut prison . Several days later , Bakri was excluded from returning to Britain by the Home Secretary , Charles Clarke , on the grounds that his presence in Britain was " not conducive to the public good . " Choudary condemned the decision and demanded to know what Bakri had done to justify the ban . He claimed that ministers were inventing rules to ensure that Bakri could not return . In November , Choudary and three other followers of Bakri were deported from Lebanon and returned to the UK . Choudary blamed the Foreign and Commonwealth Office for orchestrating their deportations , claiming that the four were there to help Bakri set up a madrasah

		CONTEXT=The show received a mixed reception from media publications . On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes , the show holds an approval rating of 43 % based on 30 critics , and summarized , " The 90th Academy Awards played it safe and hit no major snags -- but by clocking in at over four hours , returning host Jimmy Kimmel and company wore out their welcome long before the surprise ending . " Hank Stuever of '' The Washington Post '' marked , " In his second year , Kimmel has shown that the telecast need n't be anything but sharp and sure , with a funny host whose bits are manageable , shareable and – best of all – forgotten . We 're not making showbiz history here ; we 're just trying to get through another Oscar night . " Chief critic David Edelstein of '' Vulture '' wrote , " This was the best , most inspiring , and most sheerly likable Academy Awards telecast I 've ever seen . ... It was also – in terms of the actual awards – among the most disappointing . " '' Vanity Fair '' s , Richard Lawson wrote , " As a host , Kimmel struck a careful , appropriately measured tone ... All told , Sunday 's ceremony did an admirable job of recognizing all the turmoil surrounding it while maintaining the silly , chintzy trappings that so many of us tune into the Oscars for . " CNN 's Brian Lowry quipped , " The Oscars are a big , unwieldy beast , which invariably try to serve too many masters . Yet if the intent was ultimately to maintain a celebratory tone without ignoring either the outside world or the elephant in the room throughout this year 's awards , host Jimmy Kimmel and the show itself largely succeeded . " Others were more critical of the show . Television critic Maureen Ryan of '' Variety '' said , " All things considered , the show had a more or less low-key vibe . Normally it takes about two hours for the numbing effect to set in , but despite host Jimmy Kimmel 's best efforts , Sunday 's telecast started to feel a bit languid and low-energy far earlier . " Television critic James Poniewozik of '' The New York Times '' said , " despite the recent upheaval in Hollywood , the ceremony at large still focused mainly on celebration and glitter literally , in the case of the blinding set , which looked as if the ceremony were encased in an enormous geode . There 's also the perennial problem of bloat . The hitch , of course , is that every part of the show has its constituency . " Darren Franich of '' Entertainment Weekly '' wrote , " What fun we had at this year 's Oscars ! Long show , sure , but where to cut it ? " Writing for '' Deadline '' Greg Evans said , " Did the nearly four-hour running time contain any moments for the Oscar ages ? Probably not . " David Wiegand of the '' San Francisco Chronicle '' wrote , " Even the hope that the noise of clapping might keep the audience at home and in the theater awake , there was little of that for anything except the entrance of actors of advance age . " '' The Oregonian '' columnist Kristi Turnquist wrote , " Was it respectful ? Absolutely . Did it make for kind of a dull , earnest Oscars show ? Yeah , kind of . " Attaining 26.5 million U.S. viewers according to Nielsen ratings , the ceremony 's telecast had a 16-percent drop in viewership from last year 's ceremony and had the lowest U.S. viewership in Oscar history . On March 6 , after the final ratings were confirmed , President Donald Trump took to his Twitter account , saying , " Lowest rated Oscars in HISTORY . Problem is , we do n't have stars anymore – except your President ( just kidding , of course ) ! " . In response , Kimmel also tweeted , saying , " Thanks , lowest rated President in HISTORY .

		CONTEXT=Some media outlets received the broadcast positively . '' St. Louis Post-Dispatch '' television critic Gail Pennington praised Stewart 's performance as host writing that he " did the Oscars proud Sunday night , turning in a four-star hosting performance that unfortunately made the rest of the show seem sluggish by comparison . " Film critic Roger Ebert said that Stewart was " on target , topical and funny , " and added , " He was as relaxed , amusing and at home as Johnny Carson . " Columnist Ray Richmond of '' The Hollywood Reporter '' commented , " He seemed at times nervous and self-conscious , but on the whole , Stewart delivered with just the right balance of reverence and smugness . " Others media publications were more critical of the show . Television critic Rob Owen of the '' Pittsburgh Post-Gazette '' wrote that Stewart was more " amusing than funny " . He added , " Many of his jokes fell flat with the stars in the Kodak Theatre , and his tendency to bow down before celebrities quickly grew tiresome . " Tom Shales from '' The Washington Post '' commented , " It 's hard to believe that professional entertainers could have put together a show less entertaining than this year 's Oscars , hosted with a smug humorlessness by comic Jon Stewart , a sad and pale shadow of great hosts gone by . " Moreover , he derided the " piles and piles and miles and miles of clips from films present and past " writing that it " squandered the visual luster " of the ceremony . Associated Press television critic Frazier Moore remarked , " Stewart , usually a very funny guy , displayed a lack of beginner 's luck as first-time host ... His usually impeccable blend of puckishness and self-effacement fell flat in the service of Oscar . " He also criticized the decision to play music over the winner 's acceptance speeches calling it " distracting and obnoxious . " The American telecast on ABC drew in an average of 38.94 million people over its length , which was an 8 % decrease from the previous year 's ceremony . Additionally , the show earned lower Nielsen ratings compared to the previous ceremony with 23.0 % of households watching over a 35 share .

		CONTEXT=Pope Pius XII 's response to the Roman razzia ( Italian for roundup ) , or mass deportation of Jews , on October 16 , 1943 is a significant issue relating to Pope Pius XII and the Holocaust . Under Mussolini , no policy of abduction of Jews had been implemented in Italy . Following the capitulation of Italy in 1943 , Nazi forces invaded and occupied much of the country , and began deportations of Jews to extermination camps . Pius XII protested at diplomatic levels , while several thousand Jews found refuge in Catholic networks , institutions and homes across Italy , including in Vatican City and Pope Pius ' Summer Residence . The Catholic Church and some historians have credited this rescue in large part to the direction of Pope Pius XII . However , historian Susan Zuccotti researched the matter in detail and discovered that although the pope was aware of the Holocaust , he did not issue a rescue order . Zuccotti states that there is " considerable evidence of papal disapproval of the hiding of Jews and other fugitives in Vatican properties . "

After a failed resistance at the Pyramid of Cestius by remaining loyalist soldiers , carabinieri ( including a school of cadets ) , and civilians , the Germans occupied Rome . They announced the imposition of German military law with summary execution for violators . Three days later ( on 12 September ) , Nazi commandos tracked down and rescued Mussolini from his hidden prison in the Gran Sasso and set him up in the puppet regime of the so-called " Republic of Salò " in Northern Italy . In October they rounded up and deported the Jews of Rome for extermination at Auschwitz and also made numerous mass roundups of non-Jewish male civilians for forced labor . Meanwhile , General Mark Clark 's Fifth Army in Salerno suffered severe setbacks , and General Eisenhower and other Allied leaders began concentrating their attention on the imminent invasion of France , temporarily neglecting Italy

		CONTEXT=The following day , the German army began moving in on Rome , and that night the King and Badoglio fled the city for Pescara and then to Bari , leaving a leadership vacuum .

Three days later ( on 12 September ) , Nazi commandos tracked down and rescued Mussolini from his hidden prison in the Gran Sasso and set him up in the puppet regime of the so-called " Republic of Salò " in Northern Italy . In October they rounded up and deported the Jews of Rome for extermination at Auschwitz and also made numerous mass roundups of non-Jewish male civilians for forced labor .

		CONTEXT=Pope Pius XII 's response to the Roman razzia ( Italian for roundup ) , or mass deportation of Jews , on October 16 , 1943 is a significant issue relating to Pope Pius XII and the Holocaust . Under Mussolini , no policy of abduction of Jews had been implemented in Italy . Following the capitulation of Italy in 1943 , Nazi forces invaded and occupied much of the country , and began deportations of Jews to extermination camps . Pius XII protested at diplomatic levels , while several thousand Jews found refuge in Catholic networks , institutions and homes across Italy , including in Vatican City and Pope Pius ' Summer Residence . The Catholic Church and some historians have credited this rescue in large part to the direction of Pope Pius XII . However , historian Susan Zuccotti researched the matter in detail and discovered that although the pope was aware of the Holocaust , he did not issue a rescue order . Zuccotti states that there is " considerable evidence of papal disapproval of the hiding of Jews and other fugitives in Vatican properties . "

		CONTEXT=The following day , the German army began moving in on Rome , and that night the King and Badoglio fled the city for Pescara and then to Bari , leaving a leadership vacuum . The Royal Italian Army , although outnumbering the German soldiers three to one , was leaderless , poorly equipped , and in chaos . After a failed resistance at the Pyramid of Cestius by remaining loyalist soldiers , carabinieri ( including a school of cadets ) , and civilians , the Germans occupied Rome . They announced the imposition of German military law with summary execution for violators . Three days later ( on 12 September ) , Nazi commandos tracked down and rescued Mussolini from his hidden prison in the Gran Sasso and set him up in the puppet regime of the so-called " Republic of Salò " in Northern Italy . In October they rounded up and deported the Jews of Rome for extermination at Auschwitz and also made numerous mass roundups of non-Jewish male civilians for forced labor . Meanwhile , General Mark Clark 's Fifth Army in Salerno suffered severe setbacks , and General Eisenhower and other Allied leaders began concentrating their attention on the imminent invasion of France , temporarily neglecting Italy

		CONTEXT=In May 1943 the division transferred for garrison duties to the Greek island of Cefalonia .

The Germans therefore summarily executed over half of the divisions soldiers and all of its officers in revenge during the Massacre of the Acqui Division

		CONTEXT=In 1994 , Ginsburgh received widespread criticism for his article " Baruch Hagever " in which he defended Baruch Goldstein who had massacred 29 Palestinian worshippers at the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron . Rabbi Ginsburgh wrote that it is possible to view Baruch Goldstein 's act as either following or defying five Halachic principles , namely " sanctification of God 's name " , " saving life " ( referring to allegations that Goldstein had received prior warning from the IDF regarding a planned Arab massacre of Jews , " revenge " , " eradication of the seed of Amalek " and " war " . The conclusion to the article is that Goldstein 's act emanated from the super-rational powers of his soul , therefore one can not rely on logical reasoning to determine whether the act was worthy or condemnable

Another issue for Schygulla was low pay , and she led a revolt against Fassbinder during the making of '' Effi Briest '' , shot in September 1972 some time before its commercial release . His response was typically blunt : " I ca n't stand the sight of your face any more . You bust my balls " .

" US President Barack Obama approved the targeted killing of al-Awlaki by April 2010 , making al-Awlaki the first US citizen ever placed on the CIA target list . That required the consent of the US National Security Council , and officials argued that the attack was appropriate because the individual posed an imminent danger to national security . In May 2010 , Faisal Shahzad , who pleaded guilty to the 2010 Times Square car bombing attempt , told interrogators he was " inspired by " al-Awlaki , and sources said Shahzad had made contact with al-Awlaki over the Internet . Representative Jane Harman called him " terrorist number one " , and '' Investor 's Business Daily '' called him " the world 's most dangerous man " . In July 2010 , the US Treasury Department added him to its list of Specially Designated Global Terrorists , and the UN added him to its list of individuals associated with al-Qaeda . In August 2010 , al-Awlaki 's father initiated a lawsuit against the US government with the American Civil Liberties Union , challenging its order to kill al-Awlaki . In October 2010 , US and UK officials linked al-Awlaki to the 2010 cargo plane bomb plot . In September 2011 , al-Awlaki was killed in a targeted killing drone attack in Yemen .

Similarly , controversy remains over other activities held to be dragnets as well . An active area of legal controversy , for example , is that of warrant-less wiretaps . If all cell phones are monitored by machine for certain words or phrases thought to be associated with terrorism , and the results used to cue focused investigations , the ACLU argues that this constitutes a kind of dragnet . There was a large , highly publicized dragnet in Boston after the 2013 marathon race bombing . A dragnet that caught worldwide attention was conducted by French law enforcement after the Charlie Hebdo shooting that killed twelve people in January 2015

		GOLD_MENTION=UpStairs Lounge arson attack
		CONTEXT=The 1998 memorial for the 1973 UpStairs Lounge arson attack and fire proved to be a turning point for the modern LGBTQ modern rights movement in New Orleans when mourners refused to avoid TV cameras and media awaiting outside the service . Instead of using the side exit and leaving through an alley the 300-strong crowd sang " United We Stand " , a theme song of the gay bar , as they left the memorial service through the front doors . Previous to this the LGBTQ community was closeted and underground . The fire was called the " first gay tragedy of the modern rights movement " and " the last major national news event in the gay community to go almost completely unreported by the national media . " The Metropolitan Community Church has a long history in the city of New Orleans , dating back to the 1970s . A small congregation , led by Reverend William " Bill " Larson , formed in 1971 and first started holding Sunday afternoon services at St. George 's Episcopal Church run by Father Bill P. Richardson , a minister who had employed gays as assistant ministers and had just recently returned from a summer Union Theological Seminary seminar entitled " Homosexuality , Women 's Liberation , and Communal Living . " The Gay Liberation Front had recently collapsed and Richardson was determined to assist the LGBTQ community to " accept themselves . " St. George 's even opened an alternative bookstore which stocked feminist and gay liberation titles . MCC New Orleans met at St. George 's for the first six months of its existence . They then met at the Up Stairs Lounge before moving to Larson 's apartment in 1973 until June 24 , 1973 , when the UpStairs Lounge arson attack took the lives of Larson and other members of the congregation . It was one of two dozen attacks on MCC churches over the years , but it was the deadliest eventually taking thirty-two lives including both the pastor and associate pastor , the casualties included one third of the local MCC chapter . The New Orleans church was one of 36 MCC 's in the country , MCC was emerging and remains one of the largest membership LGBT organizations in the world . According to '' Out For Good '' authors Dudley Clendinen and Adam Nagourney , it was " the first gay tragedy of the modern gay rights movement , " and possibly " the last major national news event in the gay community to go almost completely unreported by the national media . " The lounge was crowded with members of the congregation and revelers celebrating the final night of their Gay pride weekend . The fire had been set on the stairs to the upstairs bar between the street door and the " solid fire door " at the second-floor entrance . The " canvas awning over the street door was untouched . " From the night of the fire the New Orleans Police Department , the State Fire Marshall 's Office and the Fire Prevention Bureau treated the blaze as an arson and repeatedly spoke of it in that light . The police department 's chief of detectives , Major Henry Morris , said there was hints of firebombing , but no evidence to prove it . No lighter or trace of gasoline was found . It was the deadliest fire in the city for nearly two hundred years and No one was ever convicted of the crimes

He later promoted a concert near the Pyramids of Teotihuacan in Mexico , to be held during the solar eclipse of 11 July 1991 . However , with only weeks to go , important equipment had not arrived and the sinking in the Atlantic Ocean of a cargo ship containing the purpose-built pyramidal stage and other technical equipment made staging the concert impossible . Jarre 's disappointment was such that he " could not cope with Mexican food for two years " . About two years later he released '' Chronologie '' , an album influenced by the techno-music scene . From a technical standpoint , the album is a reversion to a concept seen in Jarre 's '' Oxygène '' / '' Équinoxe '' period , where a grandiose overture precedes more rhythmic sections . The album features Jarre 's traditional collection of instruments like the ARP 2600 and Minimoog , as well as newer synthesisers such as the Roland JD-800 and the Kurzweil K2000

		CONTEXT=On Tuesday , October 3 , 1995 , the verdict in the O. J. Simpson murder case was announced and Simpson was acquitted on both counts of murder . The public reaction to the verdict remains a popular subject because initial polling showed that most blacks ( 70 % ) agreed with the verdict while most whites ( 75 % ) did not . The media called this the " racial gap . " In 2016 , FiveThirtyEight reported that the gap has narrowed with most African Americans now believing Simpson committed the murders . The narrowing racial gap is primarily attributed to several factors : Daniel Petrocelli disproving all of the blood planting claims at the civil trial , defense witness Dr. Henry Lee publishing a study that effectively disproved the contamination claim presented at trial , and the fading of Simpson 's celebrity status since the trial .

		CONTEXT=On Tuesday , October 3 , 1995 , the verdict in the O. J. Simpson murder case was announced and Simpson was acquitted on both counts of murder . The public reaction to the verdict remains a popular subject because initial polling showed that most blacks ( 70 % ) agreed with the verdict while most whites ( 75 % ) did not . The media called this the " racial gap . " In 2016 , FiveThirtyEight reported that the gap has narrowed with most African Americans now believing Simpson committed the murders . The narrowing racial gap is primarily attributed to several factors : Daniel Petrocelli disproving all of the blood planting claims at the civil trial , defense witness Dr. Henry Lee publishing a study that effectively disproved the contamination claim presented at trial , and the fading of Simpson 's celebrity status since the trial .

		CONTEXT=On Tuesday , October 3 , 1995 , the verdict in the O. J. Simpson murder case was announced and Simpson was acquitted on both counts of murder . The public reaction to the verdict remains a popular subject because initial polling showed that most blacks ( 70 % ) agreed with the verdict while most whites ( 75 % ) did not . The media called this the " racial gap . " In 2016 , FiveThirtyEight reported that the gap has narrowed with most African Americans now believing Simpson committed the murders . The narrowing racial gap is primarily attributed to several factors : Daniel Petrocelli disproving all of the blood planting claims at the civil trial , defense witness Dr. Henry Lee publishing a study that effectively disproved the contamination claim presented at trial , and the fading of Simpson 's celebrity status since the trial .

His intention was to seize the arms there , as many as could be taken , and use them to arm the white supporters and those few enslaved who could handle a firearm ; for the others he ordered pikes . In the Appalachian mountains there would be an anti-slavery polity , encouraging the enslaved to flee their owners , as far south as Georgia .

		CONTEXT=While the early scenes of Lincoln 's life are remarkably accurate , much of the later scenes contain historical inaccuracies . The famous Lincoln-Douglas debates , in addition to the historically accurate topic of the extension of slavery , have been turned into an argument about secession . Lincoln was famously an underdog for the Republican Presidential nomination in 1860 ; in the film it is suggested he is the sole nominee as a result of the Lincoln-Douglas debates . The outbreak of the Civil War seems to be the Union firing on Charleston , South Carolina from Fort Sumter , rather than the other way around . Also , early in hostilities , General Winfield Scott is depicted as being overconfident of a quick victory ( and something of a buffoon ) , when in reality he was one of the voices in the minority claiming the war would be long , costly , and bloody . Lincoln receives a report from the Secret Service that some copperheads in the North have issued threats against him . The Secret Service was not created until two months after Lincoln 's death . Finally , in the climax of the film , Lincoln delivers a conflation of famous words from the Gettysburg Address and Second Inaugural Address at Ford 's Theatre on April 14 , 1865 – just moments before being assassinated . This was Griffith 's second portrayal of Lincoln 's assassination , the first being in '' The Birth of a Nation ''

		CONTEXT=During the 1840s , Bowser painted banners for a diverse range of clients , including the Know Nothing Party , and received a commission to paint the portrait of prominent abolitionist and real estate developer Jacob C. White . Active in that decade 's efforts to repeal the clause in Pennsylvania 's Constitution which prohibited blacks from voting , Bowser and his family also became so involved with the abolition movement that their home became a stop on the Underground Railroad . In 1858 , politics and advocacy merged with art when Bower painted the portrait of abolitionist John Brown while Brown was visiting the Bowser home . During this same period , Bowser also completed work on his painting , '' The Firebell in the Night '' . In addition , he was also active , during this phase of his life , with the Grand United Order of Odd Fellows . As Grand Master of the Order in Philadelphia , he delivered the keynote address at the Annual Moveable Committee of the G.U.O. of O.F. in Toronto , Canada on October 17 , 1859 as its members celebrated the organization 's thirteenth anniversary . According to news reports , he was " listened to throughout with much attention , and was frequently rapturously applauded " as he " defined in eloquent terms the nature of the work of Odd Fellows — especially that great and leading principle , Charity , " and " remarked upon the practical good effected by Odd Fellowship , in alleviating distress and bestowing many of the comforts of life upon the aged and infirm of the Order , as well as conferring benefactions upon the widow and orphan . " Bowser 's work on the first banner was paid for through a commission awarded by the Contraband Relief Association ( CRA ) , an organization headed by Elizabeth Keckley , the formerly enslaved woman who became Mary Todd Lincoln 's dressmaker . It was then presented by the CRA to the leaders of 1st United States Colored Infantry . With respect to the other Bowser-designed battle flags , historians at the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission note that : " The 127th and 3rd regiments marched carrying banners reading ' We will prove ourselves men ' and ' Rather Die Freemen , Than Live To Be Slaves . ' Beneath these , black soldiers protect white women representing Columbia , the symbol of the republic . The 45th 's banner , proclaiming ' One Cause , One Country , ' shows a black soldier proudly holding an American flag in front of a bust of George Washington as black troops fight in the background . The 24th 's banner shows a black soldier ascending a hill , his arms outstretched in prayer , beneath the words ' Let Soldiers in War , Be Citizens in Peace . ' " For the 22nd USCT banner , Bowser depicted a black soldier pointing " a bayonet at the chest of a Confederate who has allowed his flag to fall and who is tossing aside his sword , " beneath the words , " Sic semper tyrannis " ( " thus always to tyrants " ) , a phrase which would come to have an entirely different meaning two years later when shouted by John Wilkes Booth after his assassination of Lincoln at Ford 's Theater

Douglas 's support for the concept of popular sovereignty , which called for each individual territory to decide on the status of slavery , alienated many Southern Democrats .

Still , at the opening , less than one-half of the delegates were committed , and many expected the convention to nominate a compromise candidate like Pennsylvania Senator Philander C. Knox , Massachusetts Senator Henry Cabot Lodge , or 1916 nominee Charles Evans Hughes . No candidate was able to corral a majority after nine ballots . After the convention adjourned for the day , Republican Senators and other leaders , who were divided and without a singular political boss , met in Room 404 of the Blackstone Hotel in Chicago . After a nightlong session , these party leaders tentatively concluded Harding was the best possible compromise candidate ; this meeting has often been described as having taken place in a " smoke-filled room . " The next day , on the tenth ballot , Harding was nominated for president . Delegates then selected Massachusetts governor Calvin Coolidge to be his vice-presidential running mate

Martin recorded the sixth most disposals of any Tiger ( 18 ) to go along with four marks , three tackles and three clearances . Two weeks later Martin was convicted by the AFL tribunal for a high hit on Sydney 's Josh Kennedy in round 3 . He did not receive a suspension for the incident however , returning to football the following week . After four matches Martin ranked fourth in the league for clearances and eighth for hard-ball gets . Media reports emerged after round 8 that the 18 year old Martin had received a significant contract offer from expansion club the Greater Western Sydney Giants . The offer , which the Herald Sun ’s Mark Robinson claimed to be worth $ 2.4 million over three seasons , would have taken effect in the new club 's first AFL season in 2012 . Martin later said he had never entertained the idea of moving to the start-up club . In round 10 he had gained attention for his on-field efforts again , this time being nominated for the 2010 AFL Rising Star award after a 21 disposal and 11 clearance match against Port Adelaide . Due to his previous tribunal conviction however , Martin was ruled ineligible for the award and thus did not officially place in the end of season award 's points tally . He drew the attention of Sydney coach Paul Roos by round 14 , prompting Roos to send veteran Brett Kirk onto Martin in a tagging role . Despite this extra attention , he still managed to record 18 disposals and a goal in the match at the MCG .

He and his co-writer , Hervé Guibert , worked for six years on the scenario , which tells of a love affair between an older man involved in prostitution and a teenage boy , a dark view in the context of HIV/AIDS . His 1994 film was '' La Reine Margot '' , based on the 1845 historical novel of the same name by Alexandre Dumas . It won the Jury Prize and Best Actress Award ( Virna Lisi ) at Cannes , as well as five César Awards . Set in the 16th-century , depicting the conflict between Catholics and Protestants in France , it shows battles and the St Bartholomew 's day massacre . A scene of the queen with the head of her lover is reminiscent of the opera '' Salome '' , uniting cult and obsession ( " Einheit von Kult und Obsession " ) , as Koch remarks . The film was Chéreau 's longest , most expensive production , and his greatest financial success .

		CONTEXT=And Japan was eager to take every opportunity . In 1869 they took advantage of the defeat of the rebels of the Republic of Ezo to incorporate definitely the island of Hokkaido to Japan . For centuries , Japan viewed the Ryukyu Islands as one of its provinces . In 1871 the Mudan incident happened : cannibal Taiwanese aborigines murdered 54 Ryūkyūan sailors that had their ship shipwrecked . At that time the Ryukyu Islands were claimed by both Qing China and Japan , and the Japanese interpreted the incident as an attack on their citizens . They took steps to bring the islands in their jurisdiction : in 1872 the Japanese Ryukyu Domain was declared , and in 1874 a retaliatory incursion to Taiwan was sent , which was a success . The success of this expedition emboldened the Japanese : not even the Americans could defeat the Taiwanese cannibals in the Formosa Expedition of 1867 . Very few gave it much thought at the time , but this was the first move in the Japanese expansionism series . Japan occupied Taiwan for the rest of 1874 and then left owing to Chinese pressures , but in 1879 it finally annexed the Ryukyu Islands . In 1875 Qing China sent a 300-men force to subdue the Taiwanese cannibals , but unlike the Japanese the Chinese were routed , ambushed and 250 of their men were killed ; the failure of this expedition exposed once more the failure of Qing China to exert effective control in Taiwan , and acted as another incentive for the Japanese to annex Taiwan . Eventually , the spoils for winning the First Sino-Japanese War in 1894 included Taiwan

The situation caused some political debate as the UN troops had been given orders only to " deter attacks " and did not have a mandate or adequate equipment to fully defend the mainly Muslim town of Goražde , which was initially declared " safe " by the UN , thus rendering them exposed when armed members of the Army of Republika Srpska ( Bosnian Serb Army ) ignored the NATO ultimatum and attacked the town without warning . The regiment managed to hold off the Bosnian Serbs until they were forced to retreat into bunkers - those who did not make it quickly enough were taken hostage - and remained trapped underground while BiH Army reinforcements arrived and fought back . The commanding officer , Lt Col Jonathon Riley ( later promoted to Lieutenant General ) , broke with protocol and directly reported to then Prime Minister John Major about the situation over the phone while in the bunker . All the men were eventually safely rescued . An unprecedented five gallantry awards , seven mentions in despatches and two Queen 's Commendations for Valuable Service were awarded to the regiment . Although the incident was largely unreported at that time , the regiment was credited in hindsight by observers for saving the town from a possible genocide - after failing to take Goražde , the Bosnian Serbs continued south to Srebrenica , where they would massacre over 8,000 Bosniaks

		CONTEXT=On Tuesday , October 3 , 1995 , the verdict in the O. J. Simpson murder case was announced and Simpson was acquitted on both counts of murder . The public reaction to the verdict remains a popular subject because initial polling showed that most blacks ( 70 % ) agreed with the verdict while most whites ( 75 % ) did not . The media called this the " racial gap . " In 2016 , FiveThirtyEight reported that the gap has narrowed with most African Americans now believing Simpson committed the murders . The narrowing racial gap is primarily attributed to several factors : Daniel Petrocelli disproving all of the blood planting claims at the civil trial , defense witness Dr. Henry Lee publishing a study that effectively disproved the contamination claim presented at trial , and the fading of Simpson 's celebrity status since the trial .

When Pacini 's popularity declined in the mid-19th century , the opera was all but forgotten until 1996 when it received its first performance in modern times at the Festival della Valle d'Itria in Martina Franca . L'ultimo giorno di Pompei influenced either directly or indirectly several other 19th - century works , most notably Karl Bryullov 's 1833 painting , The Last Day of Pompeii .

		CONTEXT=Riverside Park is a park in Kamloops , British Columbia , Canada that encompasses a beach next to a river . The park is bordered by the Thompson River and Landsdowne Street . There is a monument in the park that indicates the height to which four different floods reached throughout the history of the park . Riverside Park also includes a water park . There is an 11 PM curfew at the park , but it is not normally enforced . In 1885 , the site that would eventually become the park was used as a campsite by Chinese Canadians from Savona 's Ferry working on the Canadian Pacific Railway . When members of the On - to - Ottawa Trek stopped in Kamloops on their way from Vancouver to Ottawa , Ontario in 1935 , Mayor W.J. Moffat offered the men an empty hospital to sleep in , but the men declined , many choosing rather to sleep in Riverside Park where they had only one blanket to share between three or four men . In 2011 , a parking garage was proposed to be built in the park , but a group called the Friends of Riverside Park gathered signatures from more than 10 % of the Kamloops electorate opposing the proposal , thereby forcing a referendum on the subject . Before the referendum could take place , however , the city council unanimously voted to put an end to the plans to build the parking garage .

The storms brought warmer 50 °F ( 10 °C ) weather that was a cause of one stage of flooding and the continuous rains a second cause of flooding . The natural run-off of 1 to 3 inches ( 2.5 to 7.5 cm ) was far surpassed by the deluge of from 10 to 30 inches ( 25 to 75 cm ) of water in the region . The flood came before pending flood control legislation was enacted or any significant flood control measures implemented . The narrowness of the valleys and encroachment of buildings on the river banks contributed to record flooding . By the time nightfall came one-third of the city was under of water and by the time flooding was over twenty-five people lost their lives . The damages , estimated at $ 43 million , made it the worst flood since the flood of 1889 and the event is chronicled at the Johnstown Flood Museum After the flood , sweeping nationwide flood control laws were enacted and from 1938 to 1943 Johnstown saw many projects completed . These measures gave the people the feeling that the area was now " flood free " , and it was touted as such until the flood of 1977

		CONTEXT=The region had already experienced several large earthquakes , the very large 1855 Wairarapa Earthquake , and the 1934 Pahiatua earthquake in the Northern Wairarapa . The 1855 earthquake occurred on the Wairarapa Fault which is part of the North Island Fault System . At 11.16 pm a small and sharp but brief earthquake of magnitude 7.2 Ms ( Mw 6.9-7.2 ) shook a wide area in the lower North Island from Eketahuna to Masterton , Featherston and Wellington ; and was noticed from Auckland to near Dunedin . The main earthquake was of 7.2 Ms and the epicentre was near Masterton and 12 km deep . The quake lasted for over a minute and had been preceded by a foreshock three hours earlier at 8.15 pm . Many buildings in Masterton were damaged . The mayor Thomas Jordan declared a state of emergency and got troops to patrol the town . There was considerable damage in Palmerston North . In Wellington twenty thousand chimneys fell , and there was one death in the suburb of Kelburn when a 70-year old retired chemist Hedley Victor Evens ( sic ) was killed by coal gas from a fractured pipe . Some downtown pediments were damaged , but some had already been removed after the 1931 Hawke 's Bay earthquake . The city engineer K. E . Luke held that damage was less severe as the quake ended swiftly . Another shock in the area struck on 2nd August at 12.34 am , preceded by a foreshock on the late afternoon of the 1st .

		CONTEXT=Released in Europe to acclaim in 1952 , '' Othello '' won the '' Grand Prix du Festival International du Film '' at the Cannes Film Festival under the Moroccan flag . Welles could not find the film a distributor in the United States for over three years , and even after its U.S. release it was largely ignored . The film was re-released to theaters in a 1992 restoration that screened out of competition at the 1992 Cannes Film Festival and was shown to acclaim in the United States . The film has a 93 % approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes , based on 32 reviews with an average rating of 7.9 / 10 . The website 's critical consensus states , " This ragged take on Othello may take liberties with the source material , but Orson Welles 's genius never fails to impress . " In 1992 , Beatrice Welles-Smith , daughter of Orson Welles , supervised the restoration of the film , which saw over $ 1 million spent on improving the picture quality , re-synching the audio , adding extra sound effects , and completely re-recording the music in stereo . Although the restoration was greeted with positive reviews upon its release , it subsequently came under attack for numerous technical flaws and alterations . Further alterations were made between the restoration 's theatrical release and its home media release , after complaints that the opening scene lacked the Gregorian chanting it had previously had , and another scene was missing entirely . This is the only version which has been available on VHS and DVD since the mid-1990s , since legal action by Beatrice Welles has blocked either version released by Orson Welles from being sold . This version runs to 91 minutes

		CONTEXT=On January 27 , 2011 the festival sent 9 filmmakers to 9 cities across the US to screen and discuss their films . The cities and films included : Bob Tourtellotte of Reuters wrote " Sundance 2011 has proven to be exceptionally strong , audiences and filmmakers seem to agree . " Tourtellotte reported that Robert Redford said that three years ago the Sundance Institute " set out to get back to its roots of supporting alternative voices in cinema and he felt like this year that strategy paid off . " Redford said " This year , what has excited me , is I think the quality is increasing in diversity and is increasing in depth . " The AP reported that Redford said it 's " always a relief " when the festival ends because " it 's really exhausting . " Kenneth Turan , film critic for the '' Los Angeles Times '' , wrote " though the festival has gotten ever bigger — and ( thankfully ) more efficient in moving its close to 50,000 attendees in and out of its far-flung theaters — it still retains the scrappy , antic spirit that has animated it from the start . " Turan wrote " One of the paradoxes of Sundance is that the quirkiness and charm around the edges of the festival are not always fully appreciated because so much of the media focus is on the premieres section and the U.S. dramatic competition " which he said " are , frankly , often the weakest parts of the festival . " Turan said " Sundance 's insistence on giving equal weight to documentaries and dramas has made it into as important a nonfiction showcase as any festival in the world ; witness the fact that four out of the five Oscar-nominated docs this year debuted at Sundance last January . " He also wrote that the foreign language film competition " is a strength at Sundance , and yet that field is given even less popular attention than the documentaries . " Peter Knegt wrote that this year 's festival " probably wo n't replicate last year 's Oscar record . " He said " Despite a huge surge in sales , this year 's Sundance slate looks like it might be the least Oscar-friendly in some time . " He noted that the U.S. Dramatic Grand Jury Prize winners have been nominated for Best Picture for two years ( referring to '' Precious '' and '' Winter 's Bone '' ) . Knegt speculated on films that might be nominated for the Oscars .

		CONTEXT=In 2012 , Mirren played Alfred Hitchcock 's wife Alma Reville in the 2012 biopic '' Hitchcock '' , directed by Sacha Gervasi and based on Stephen Rebello 's non-fiction book '' Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho '' . The film centres on the pair 's relationship during the making of '' Psycho '' , a controversial horror film that became one of the most acclaimed and influential works in the filmmaker 's career . It became a moderate arthouse success and garnered a lukewarm critical response from critics , who felt that it suffered from " tonal inconsistency and a lack of truly insightful retrospection . " Mirren was universally praised for her play however , with Roger Ebert noting that the film depended most on her portrayal , which he found to be " warm and effective . " Her other film that year was '' The Door '' , a claustrophobic drama film directed by István Szabó , based on the Hungarian novel of the same name . Set at the height of communist rule in 1960s Hungary , the story of the adaptation centres on the abrasive influence that a mysterious housekeeper wields over her employer and successful novelist , played Martina Gedeck .

" The following year , Mirren replaced Bette Midler in David Mamet 's biographical television film '' Phil Spector '' about the American musician . The HBO film focuses on the relationship between Spector and his defense attorney Linda Kenney Baden , played by Mirren , during the first of his two murder trials for the 2003 death of Lana Clarkson in his California mansion . '' Spector '' received largely mixed to positive reviews from critics , particularly for Mirren and co-star Al Pacino 's performances , and was nominated for eleven Primetime Emmy Awards , also winning Mirren a Screen Actors Guild Award at the 20th awards ceremony .

Also in 2013 , Mirren voiced the character of Dean Abigail Hardscrabble in Pixar 's computer-animated comedy film '' Monsters University '' , which grossed $ 743 million against its estimated budget of $ 200 million , and reprised her role in the sequel film '' Red 2 '' .
