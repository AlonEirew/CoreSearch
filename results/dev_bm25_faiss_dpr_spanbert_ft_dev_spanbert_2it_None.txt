		CONTEXT=Extensive damage from the 1977 flood was heavy and there was talk of the company pulling out . Again , the city won a reprieve from the company 's top management , which had always regarded the Johnstown works with special affection because of its history and reputation . As the increasing amount of federal environmental regulations became more difficult to comply with and the issues with the aging manufacturing facilities grew more significant , and as steel companies began closing down plants all over the country , by 1982 it looked as if Johnstown had exhausted its appeals . By the early 1990s , Johnstown abandoned most of its steel production , although some limited fabrication work continues

		ANSWER=Nieuwmarkt riots
		GOLD_MENTION=
		CONTEXT=The Nieuwmarkt riots ( Dutch : Nieuwmarktrellen ) , also referred to as the Amsterdam metro riots , is a series of serious disturbances in the Nieuwmarkt neighbourhood of Amsterdam , Netherlands . On 24 March 1975 , which later became known as Blue Monday , and on 8 April 1975 , protests against the planned demolition of homes ended in confrontations with over a hundred municipal police supported by 500 military police . The homes were considered by residents and protesters to be in good condition , but had to make way for the construction of the East Line tunnel of the Amsterdam metro . This was needed because the construction of the 3.5 km tunnel was largely done by sinking large concrete caissons . As a result of the riots , the city council of Amsterdam decided to abandon further plans for additional metro lines .

		CONTEXT=The canyon was just one of the many areas along the Front Range that were devastated in the September 2013 flood . While not as intense as the 1976 flood , the storms that caused the flooding in 2013 still sent enough water down the canyon to wash out the highway in many places . The flood also damaged the US Bureau of Reclamation 's Dille Diversion Dam . The biggest infrastructure casualty , however , was the City of Loveland 's hydroelectric plant ( rebuilt after the 1976 flood ) ; the Idylwilde Reservoir was completely filled with silt and rocks , the Idylwilde Dam broke free of the bedrock , and the hydroelectric plant in the Viestenz-Smith Mountain Park was filled with water and silt . The dam was in the process of being relicensed with the FERC , but it was instead demolished , the dam material and contents of the reservoir being used as fill for highway repairs . The park is currently being redone in such a way to better withstand future flooding

		GOLD_MENTION=devastating floods
		CONTEXT=December 1861 and January 1862 brought about devastating floods that placed the future of the city in doubt . In order to resolve the situation , the city residents agreed that additional levee construction was necessary . However , the city was divided between camps that supported a relatively small grading of a few feet to raise the city just above the rivers ' cresting levels and those that supported a substantial grading to accommodate basements in city businesses . In the upcoming election of 1863 , the level at which the city should be raised became a primary factor ; a candidate that supported high-level grading won , and high-level grading renovation proceeded . Earth was removed from a dangerous bend nearby the confluence of the two rivers and used to raise city blocks in 1868 ; the city 's sidewalks , until construction was finally finished , were uneven because neighbors of raised city blocks often remained at the pre-construction level . After the filled regions beneath buildings had settled , new streets had to be paved . While planking had been used in the past , newly raised streets chose either the smooth ( though indurable ) Nicolson pavement or the easily dirtied ( though durable ) cobblestone pavement . Grading and paving processes were fully completed by 1873 , leaving the first floors of many buildings at the time as basements and leaving second floors as new main floors . Today , this system of 19th-century basements is known as the Sacramento Underground

		GOLD_MENTION=Republican National Convention
		CONTEXT=The organization 's leaders maintained that " some U.S. laws , such as the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 , which limits the amount of time a family can receive federal assistance , violate Articles 23 , 25 and 26 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights . Those articles guarantee , respectively , the right to work for a living wage under humane conditions ; the right to adequate food , housing , medical care and social security ; and the right to education . " Starting in June 1998 , KWRU led the New Freedom Bus Tour , which traveled across the country , gathering stories of human rights violations to present as a petition to the United Nations . " Under the banner ' Freedom from Unemployment , Hunger and Homelessness , ' the KWRU team collected additional evidence on the negative impact of welfare reform and held educational sessions teaching the poor about their economic rights . " ( A second such bus tour was organized by the PPEHRC in November – December 2002 , which traveled to 27 cities to record human rights violations . ) In the late 1990s , Honkala started another nonprofit , the Poor People 's Economic Human Rights Campaign , of which she became National Coordinator . The PPEHRC represents " a network of over 40 poor people 's organizations from across the U.S. " One commentator has written that the campaign " is the only national movement to come out of welfare reform that has been organized by poor people , and not their advocates . " This organization was formed in direct response to the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act ( PRWORA ) of 1996 ( also known as the Welfare Reform Act ) , signed into law by Democratic President Bill Clinton , which she and her allies claim hurts recipients of welfare . The organization 's mission statement reads , " The Poor People 's Economic Human Rights Campaign is committed to uniting the poor across color lines as the leadership base for a broad movement to abolish poverty . We work to accomplish this through advancing economic human rights as named in the universal declaration of human rights — such as the rights to food , housing , health , education , communication and a living wage job . " Part of the purpose of the organization is to make homelessness and the homeless visible , in order to force politicians to act . Honkala claims that the latter prefer that the homeless remain invisible , so they wo n't have to address the problem . In a speech , Honkala said : " That 's what the authorities are saying to you : ' Go hide ! Go be under a bridge , or ... hide under a bench , and we wo n't arrest you , we wo n't do anything to you , because you will be quiet ! ' " As Honkala declared , " When you have nothing , you still have your voice . " In October 1999 , PPEHRC organized a month-long March of the Americas , from Washington , DC , to the United Nations in New York . Participants in the march included low-income families from the US , Canada and Latin America . The group " marched 15 miles a day for 32 days , sleeping in tent cities , churches and community centers at night , and holding press conferences and protests in local communities . " In July 2000 , a PPEHRC march for the opening day of the Republican Party 's National Convention in Philadelphia drew 10,000 homeless and poor people from around the country . ( Of the several protest marches during that convention , this was the only one denied a permit by city authorities . ) In November 2000 , at the historic Riverside Church in Manhattan in New York City , the PPEHRC held a " Poor People 's World Summit to End Poverty , " consisting of several hundred activists from some 30 countries , to share " experiences and work to build an international movement for economic human rights drawing explicitly on international treaties . " On July 4 , 2003 , Philadelphia held a celebration for the opening of the National Constitution Center , a new facility housing the Liberty Bell . Poor and homeless families from the city held a peaceful protest to demand their economic rights . " As the demonstrators marched toward Constitution Center single-file , carrying their own mattresses and led by children , park rangers , federal guards , and city police formed lines to prevent the families from approaching . Singing ' We Shall Not Be Moved , ' the demonstrators locked arms and refused to leave the sidewalk . Protest leaders Honkala and Galen Tyler had prepared a ' Declaration of Economic Human Rights ' to present at the Center . As they moved toward the Center , police moved to stop them , threw them to the ground , handcuffed them , and placed them under arrest ... Honkala was charged with one first-degree felony and four other felony counts . Police officers claimed that Honkala had struck one of them in the chest . However , a video taken at the time clearly shows Honkala carrying a mattress and being struck by the officer ... all the charges were subsequently withdrawn by the District Attorney 's office . " In August 2004 , Honkala marched with the PPEHRC in New York City ( without a permit ) to protest President Bush and the Republican National Convention ( RNC ) and to publicly call for greater attention by the government to the needs of the poor and homeless

		ANSWER=Open Mouth Operations
		GOLD_MENTION=
		CONTEXT=Open mouth operations are communications by a central bank that affect Central Bank interest rates . They are a tool of monetary policy . The term was coined by economists Graeme Guthrie and Julian Wright in the year 2000 . While looking at the operations and communications of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand , these economists found that communications by the central bank had a much more significant effect on the interest rate than did Central Bank operations . Unbeknownst to most economists , Open Mouth Operations let central banks change interest rates without significantly changing their daily monetary operations . Mario Draghi 's 2012 statement that “ the ECB will do whatever it takes to preserve the euro , and believe me , it will be enough ” , is an example of a successful Open Mouth Operation used to lower the interest rates of Spanish government bonds : following the announcement , Spanish government bond interest rates dropped 352 basis points without the ECB having to purchase them .

		ANSWER=criticising capitalism
		GOLD_MENTION=mass murder
		CONTEXT=In 1988 , the party made '' The Next Step '' into a bulletin for its supporters . Later that year , a monthly magazine called '' Living Marxism '' was set up for a wider readership . Despite its beginnings as a far-left outlet , the politics espoused by the magazine developed a pronounced libertarianism . In December 1990 , '' Living Marxism '' ran an article which argued that the corrosive effect of the collapse of both Stalinism and reformism on the working class meant that " for the time being at least , the working class has no political existence " . In 1997 , the point was put more forcefully : In today 's circumstances class politics can not be reinvented , rebuilt , reinvigorated or rescued . Why ? Because any dynamic political outlook needs to exist in an interaction with existing individual consciousness . And contemporary forms of consciousness in our atomised societies can not be used as the foundation for a more developed politics of solidarity . Between 1990 and 1997 , the party developed the view that more than capitalism itself the danger facing humanity was the absence of a force for social change ( in philosophical language , a " subject " of history ) and the culture of low expectations that suppressed it . Prefacing a 1996 '' Living Marxism '' manifesto , Mick Hume argued : Of course ... we could have produced a familiar list of left-wing slogans complaining about problems like unemployment , exploitation and poverty which continue to scar our society . But that would be to ignore the transformation which has taken place in the political climate ... . At different times , different issues matter most . Each era has thrown up its own great questions which define which side you are on ... . A t '' Living Marxism '' , we see our job today as doing much more than criticising capitalism . That is the easy bit . There is a more pressing need to criticise the fatalistic critics , to counter the doom-mongers and put a positive case for human action in pursuit of social liberation . ... D ealing with ... unconventional questions , and puncturing the anti-human prejudices which surround them , is the precondition for making political action possible in our time . In February 1997 , shortly after the party disbanded , '' Living Marxism '' re-branded as '' LM '' , possibly to further distance itself from its leftist origins . Articles in '' LM '' argued : This magazine ran at least two articles in which the authors argued that the mass murder carried out in Rwanda in 1994 should not be described as genocide . In December 1995 , '' LM '' carried a report from an aid worker in Rwanda which argued : The lesson I would draw from my visit is that we must reject the term ' genocide ' in Rwanda . It has been used inside and outside Rwanda to criminalise the majority of ordinary Rwandan people , to justify outside interference in the country 's affairs , and to lend legitimacy to a minority military government imposed on Rwanda by Western powers . '' LM '' continued to create controversy on a variety of issues , most notably on the British Independent Television News ( ITN ) coverage of the Balkan conflict in the 1990s . The controversy centred on '' LM '' featuring an article by Thomas Deichmann in which he alleged that the ITN coverage of a refugee detention centre in Trnopolje during the conflict gave the false impression that the Bosnian Muslims were being held against their will in Serbian concentration camps . The ensuing libel award and costs arising from legal action by the ITN against '' LM '' were estimated to total around £ 1 million . The action bankrupted the magazine and its publishers

		CONTEXT=Prior to the 1912 United States presidential election , Wheeler publicly debated the former California governor James N. Gillett on the question of which Republican nominee deserved the backing of his party , to be decided at the primary elections . Wheeler spoke for Theodore Roosevelt while Gillett argued for incumbent William Howard Taft . Wheeler said Taft was " blind to the signs of the times " , the candidate of " men satisfied with the old political methods . " In the event , Taft won the primary but Roosevelt ran anyway as a third party candidate , splitting the Republican vote to allow Woodrow Wilson to gain the presidency . In 1920 , Wheeler traveled to Chicago to serve as alternate delegate for California at the Republican National Convention . The California delegation put Wheeler on the podium to give a rousing speech for the nomination of California-born candidate Hiram Johnson who had been Roosevelt 's running mate in 1912

		ANSWER=criticising capitalism
		GOLD_MENTION=mass murder
		CONTEXT=In 1988 , the party made '' The Next Step '' into a bulletin for its supporters . Later that year , a monthly magazine called '' Living Marxism '' was set up for a wider readership . Despite its beginnings as a far-left outlet , the politics espoused by the magazine developed a pronounced libertarianism . In December 1990 , '' Living Marxism '' ran an article which argued that the corrosive effect of the collapse of both Stalinism and reformism on the working class meant that " for the time being at least , the working class has no political existence " . In 1997 , the point was put more forcefully : In today 's circumstances class politics can not be reinvented , rebuilt , reinvigorated or rescued . Why ? Because any dynamic political outlook needs to exist in an interaction with existing individual consciousness . And contemporary forms of consciousness in our atomised societies can not be used as the foundation for a more developed politics of solidarity . Between 1990 and 1997 , the party developed the view that more than capitalism itself the danger facing humanity was the absence of a force for social change ( in philosophical language , a " subject " of history ) and the culture of low expectations that suppressed it . Prefacing a 1996 '' Living Marxism '' manifesto , Mick Hume argued : Of course ... we could have produced a familiar list of left-wing slogans complaining about problems like unemployment , exploitation and poverty which continue to scar our society . But that would be to ignore the transformation which has taken place in the political climate ... . At different times , different issues matter most . Each era has thrown up its own great questions which define which side you are on ... . A t '' Living Marxism '' , we see our job today as doing much more than criticising capitalism . That is the easy bit . There is a more pressing need to criticise the fatalistic critics , to counter the doom-mongers and put a positive case for human action in pursuit of social liberation . ... D ealing with ... unconventional questions , and puncturing the anti-human prejudices which surround them , is the precondition for making political action possible in our time . In February 1997 , shortly after the party disbanded , '' Living Marxism '' re-branded as '' LM '' , possibly to further distance itself from its leftist origins . Articles in '' LM '' argued : This magazine ran at least two articles in which the authors argued that the mass murder carried out in Rwanda in 1994 should not be described as genocide . In December 1995 , '' LM '' carried a report from an aid worker in Rwanda which argued : The lesson I would draw from my visit is that we must reject the term ' genocide ' in Rwanda . It has been used inside and outside Rwanda to criminalise the majority of ordinary Rwandan people , to justify outside interference in the country 's affairs , and to lend legitimacy to a minority military government imposed on Rwanda by Western powers . '' LM '' continued to create controversy on a variety of issues , most notably on the British Independent Television News ( ITN ) coverage of the Balkan conflict in the 1990s . The controversy centred on '' LM '' featuring an article by Thomas Deichmann in which he alleged that the ITN coverage of a refugee detention centre in Trnopolje during the conflict gave the false impression that the Bosnian Muslims were being held against their will in Serbian concentration camps . The ensuing libel award and costs arising from legal action by the ITN against '' LM '' were estimated to total around £ 1 million . The action bankrupted the magazine and its publishers

		GOLD_MENTION=Republican National Convention
		CONTEXT=The organization 's leaders maintained that " some U.S. laws , such as the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 , which limits the amount of time a family can receive federal assistance , violate Articles 23 , 25 and 26 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights . Those articles guarantee , respectively , the right to work for a living wage under humane conditions ; the right to adequate food , housing , medical care and social security ; and the right to education . " Starting in June 1998 , KWRU led the New Freedom Bus Tour , which traveled across the country , gathering stories of human rights violations to present as a petition to the United Nations . " Under the banner ' Freedom from Unemployment , Hunger and Homelessness , ' the KWRU team collected additional evidence on the negative impact of welfare reform and held educational sessions teaching the poor about their economic rights . " ( A second such bus tour was organized by the PPEHRC in November – December 2002 , which traveled to 27 cities to record human rights violations . ) In the late 1990s , Honkala started another nonprofit , the Poor People 's Economic Human Rights Campaign , of which she became National Coordinator . The PPEHRC represents " a network of over 40 poor people 's organizations from across the U.S. " One commentator has written that the campaign " is the only national movement to come out of welfare reform that has been organized by poor people , and not their advocates . " This organization was formed in direct response to the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act ( PRWORA ) of 1996 ( also known as the Welfare Reform Act ) , signed into law by Democratic President Bill Clinton , which she and her allies claim hurts recipients of welfare . The organization 's mission statement reads , " The Poor People 's Economic Human Rights Campaign is committed to uniting the poor across color lines as the leadership base for a broad movement to abolish poverty . We work to accomplish this through advancing economic human rights as named in the universal declaration of human rights — such as the rights to food , housing , health , education , communication and a living wage job . " Part of the purpose of the organization is to make homelessness and the homeless visible , in order to force politicians to act . Honkala claims that the latter prefer that the homeless remain invisible , so they wo n't have to address the problem . In a speech , Honkala said : " That 's what the authorities are saying to you : ' Go hide ! Go be under a bridge , or ... hide under a bench , and we wo n't arrest you , we wo n't do anything to you , because you will be quiet ! ' " As Honkala declared , " When you have nothing , you still have your voice . " In October 1999 , PPEHRC organized a month-long March of the Americas , from Washington , DC , to the United Nations in New York . Participants in the march included low-income families from the US , Canada and Latin America . The group " marched 15 miles a day for 32 days , sleeping in tent cities , churches and community centers at night , and holding press conferences and protests in local communities . " In July 2000 , a PPEHRC march for the opening day of the Republican Party 's National Convention in Philadelphia drew 10,000 homeless and poor people from around the country . ( Of the several protest marches during that convention , this was the only one denied a permit by city authorities . ) In November 2000 , at the historic Riverside Church in Manhattan in New York City , the PPEHRC held a " Poor People 's World Summit to End Poverty , " consisting of several hundred activists from some 30 countries , to share " experiences and work to build an international movement for economic human rights drawing explicitly on international treaties . " On July 4 , 2003 , Philadelphia held a celebration for the opening of the National Constitution Center , a new facility housing the Liberty Bell . Poor and homeless families from the city held a peaceful protest to demand their economic rights . " As the demonstrators marched toward Constitution Center single-file , carrying their own mattresses and led by children , park rangers , federal guards , and city police formed lines to prevent the families from approaching . Singing ' We Shall Not Be Moved , ' the demonstrators locked arms and refused to leave the sidewalk . Protest leaders Honkala and Galen Tyler had prepared a ' Declaration of Economic Human Rights ' to present at the Center . As they moved toward the Center , police moved to stop them , threw them to the ground , handcuffed them , and placed them under arrest ... Honkala was charged with one first-degree felony and four other felony counts . Police officers claimed that Honkala had struck one of them in the chest . However , a video taken at the time clearly shows Honkala carrying a mattress and being struck by the officer ... all the charges were subsequently withdrawn by the District Attorney 's office . " In August 2004 , Honkala marched with the PPEHRC in New York City ( without a permit ) to protest President Bush and the Republican National Convention ( RNC ) and to publicly call for greater attention by the government to the needs of the poor and homeless

		GOLD_MENTION=2010 MTV Video Music Awards
		CONTEXT=The design team for the series conceived eighteen outfits to compliment Gaga 's outré and eccentric reputation , although they did not collaborate with any of Gaga 's stylists or creative director Nicola Formichetti . Due to the outfits ' unconventional appearances , Jean was given more freedom to animate the large array of costumes , as these rapid changes " would n't be possible in real life " . " There 's a moment in the episode , " Jean resumed , " when she starts out with her hair down . Then , there 's a curtain pulled in front of her , and in seconds , she has a completely different outfit on with a cone bra and her hair is all hairsprayed up and big and frizzy . In real life , that would probably take 8 hours . " Many of the costumes were inspired from previous outfits Gaga had worn , including her meat dress and her Kermit the Frog dress . " We did a lot of research , looking back at her old outfits , and she 's really been in a million different things , had a million different looks . " Many aspects of Gaga 's career are referenced in the episode . " You 're All My Little Monsters " , a musical number specifically created for the episode , is a parody of Gaga 's relationship with her devout " Little Monsters " — a phrase Gaga uses to refer to her fans . To '' Spin '' columnist Devon Maloney , the song was ultimately an overtly cartoonized version of her single " Born This Way " ( 2011 ) that embraces the " freakiness " of Springfield . Several of Gaga 's outfits and looks emulate several iconic costumes the singer had previously worn , such as the " Living Dress " and pyrotechnic leotard she wore during her endeavors on The Monster Ball Tour , as well as her wardrobe at the 53rd Grammy Awards . One in particular , a dress consisting of pork chops , is a parody of the singer 's meat dress , which she wore at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards . During the credits of " Lisa Goes Gaga " , main character Homer Simpson performs a rendition of " Poker Face " ( 2009 ) . At the end of the episode , a title card promotes the Maggie-starring short film '' The Longest Daycare '' , which was shown before '' Ice Age : Continental Drift '' ( 2012 )

Jim Farber of '' Daily News '' wrote that " she delivered it with equal parts defiance and need " .

		CONTEXT=The album received mixed reviews from music critics . According to review aggregator Metacritic , the album has a score of 48/100 based on 8 reviews , indicating " mixed or average reviews " . On another aggregator website , Album of the Year , it holds the 4th position on a list of worst reviewed albums of 2014 . Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic gave the album 2.5 stars out of 5 saying that " Michele is not a natural pop star . This was true in 2009 when she debuted on '' Glee '' as Rachel Berry and it 's even clearer in 2014 . " Mike Ayers from '' Billboard '' gave a mostly positive review , saying , " Lyrically , '' Louder '' is rather one-sided , as she often sings about the perils of relationships , over and over , in ways that we 've all heard many times at this point . Still , it 's a solid effort that shows she has promise as a bonafide pop artist . " Sarah Rodman of '' The Boston Globe '' gave the album a mostly positive review , writing , " The Broadway veteran puts her mighty soprano through its paces on bouncy dance tracks , soaring ballads , and midtempo pop tunes where she straddles the line , mostly comfortably , between Katy Perry and Celine Dion . " Kyle Anderson of '' Entertainment Weekly '' gave the album a B - , writing , " It 's hard to be that mad at '' Louder '' , because it 's so admirably and lovingly crafted . There 's nothing wrong with Lea Michele 's debut , and that 's its biggest problem . While well curated and exquisitely executed , '' Louder '' is missing the visceral oomph that defines the gulf between superstars and the rest of the top 40 chum . " At '' USA Today '' , Jerry Shriver rated the album 2.5 stars out of four , and stated that " softer would have been a better approach . " He added that the song " Battlefield " points to a more promising direction . Kevin McFarland of '' The A.V. Club '' gave a C - rating , writing , " '' Louder '' , Michele 's debut solo album under her own name , does feature her distinctive talent as a vocalist . But the record is caught in an unfortunate stylistic limbo between fun-loving , youthful pop and the maturity of adult contemporary artists . " Jim Farber of the '' New York Daily News '' awarded the album two stars . He criticized , " Michele does n't so much sing as trumpet like an elephant eager for the charge . Her voice has more need than vulnerability , more anger than understanding . " Christopher R. Weingarten of '' Rolling Stone '' also gave a negative review , stating , " This album of insta-dated EDM-pop anthems and half-cocked bass drops probably wo n't help Michele 's cause . The songs about love 's ups and downs have a few memorable lyrics ( ' My heart 's too drunk to drive ' ) but not nearly enough . " '' Louder '' was nominated for World 's Best Album at the 2014 World Music Awards , held in Monaco on May 27 , 2014

		CONTEXT=The " Take a Bow " video was a source of inspiration for Justin Timberlake 's music video for his 2006 single , " SexyBack " . According to Timberlake , he decided to work with director Michael Haussman on his " SexyBack " video because " Take a Bow " is one of his favorite Madonna videos . He went on to say " Even today , I still remember the visuals , the images , how he captured her . A lot of times , Madonna seems like she 's the person in control , and in that video , she seemed vulnerable . It was a cool thing to see . " According to director Dave Meyers , the music video for Britney Spears ' 2009 single " Radar " is a " tribute " to Madonna 's " Take a Bow " video . When speaking of Spears and the " Radar " video , Meyers explained , " we were looking for a way to take her into a contemporary , classy environment . I felt empowered by referencing Madonna 's ' Take a Bow ' video . Britney has n't done anything like that .

Babyface said the performance was terrifying for him : " I was nervous as hell . But you could n't actually see my legs shaking under the suit . When we finished , she told me she had never been that nervous before . That was crazy to me -- I was thinking , ' You 're Madonna , you 're on stage all the time ! ' " . On February 18 , 1995 , Madonna arrived in Europe to promote '' Bedtime Stories '' ; that same day , she appeared on German TV show '' Wetten , dass . . ?

Direct Lyrics ' Kevin Apaza wrote : " We totally dug this video . We liked the high budget , all the perfect details , the deep message conveyed , and of course Katy 's humor too " . Ross McNeilage from MTV UK similarly praised the video , pointing out its " high-concept " and stating : " The ... singer 's visual treatment brings the lyrics to life , highlighting its themes of resilience with a fitting storyline . Despite the serious undertones of defiance , the video is jam-packed with Katy 's goofy humour throughout and does n't take itself too seriously at all . " Evan Jorssen of NRJ likened the three women seen in the clip accompanying Perry to characters from the 1993 American comedy horror fantasy film '' Hocus Pocus '' and the 1899 French film '' Cinderella '' . Julien Goncalves of Pure Charts compared parts of the video 's concept to Madonna 's live performance of " Vogue " ( 1990 ) at the 1990 MTV Video Music Awards . In a negative review , Highsnobiety 's Gorsler wrote : " The visuals are , to put it kindly , less than stellar , with over-the-top production and a lavishly nonsensical plot making the music video one of the weirdest things to come out this year . But all that is to be expected from an artist like Katy Perry , who is famous for her eccentricity . " He also criticized the heavy product placement and the use of an air horn rap trumpet sound at the beginning of the video , which " sound s like Katy Perry spent a little too much time playing around with Virtual DJ " .

		ANSWER=Gaga
		GOLD_MENTION=2010 MTV Video Music Awards
		CONTEXT=The design team for the series conceived eighteen outfits to compliment Gaga 's outré and eccentric reputation , although they did not collaborate with any of Gaga 's stylists or creative director Nicola Formichetti . Due to the outfits ' unconventional appearances , Jean was given more freedom to animate the large array of costumes , as these rapid changes " would n't be possible in real life " . " There 's a moment in the episode , " Jean resumed , " when she starts out with her hair down . Then , there 's a curtain pulled in front of her , and in seconds , she has a completely different outfit on with a cone bra and her hair is all hairsprayed up and big and frizzy . In real life , that would probably take 8 hours . " Many of the costumes were inspired from previous outfits Gaga had worn , including her meat dress and her Kermit the Frog dress . " We did a lot of research , looking back at her old outfits , and she 's really been in a million different things , had a million different looks . " Many aspects of Gaga 's career are referenced in the episode . " You 're All My Little Monsters " , a musical number specifically created for the episode , is a parody of Gaga 's relationship with her devout " Little Monsters " — a phrase Gaga uses to refer to her fans . To '' Spin '' columnist Devon Maloney , the song was ultimately an overtly cartoonized version of her single " Born This Way " ( 2011 ) that embraces the " freakiness " of Springfield . Several of Gaga 's outfits and looks emulate several iconic costumes the singer had previously worn , such as the " Living Dress " and pyrotechnic leotard she wore during her endeavors on The Monster Ball Tour , as well as her wardrobe at the 53rd Grammy Awards . One in particular , a dress consisting of pork chops , is a parody of the singer 's meat dress , which she wore at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards . During the credits of " Lisa Goes Gaga " , main character Homer Simpson performs a rendition of " Poker Face " ( 2009 ) . At the end of the episode , a title card promotes the Maggie-starring short film '' The Longest Daycare '' , which was shown before '' Ice Age : Continental Drift '' ( 2012 )

Nina Braca from '' Billboard '' called it " triumphant " , while '' The Malay Mail '' said it was " humorous " , and Nolfi from '' Entertainment Weekly '' described it as " candy-colored " . Direct Lyrics ' Kevin Apaza wrote : " We totally dug this video . We liked the high budget , all the perfect details , the deep message conveyed , and of course Katy 's humor too " . Ross McNeilage from MTV UK similarly praised the video , pointing out its " high-concept " and stating : " The ... singer 's visual treatment brings the lyrics to life , highlighting its themes of resilience with a fitting storyline . Despite the serious undertones of defiance , the video is jam-packed with Katy 's goofy humour throughout and does n't take itself too seriously at all . " Evan Jorssen of NRJ likened the three women seen in the clip accompanying Perry to characters from the 1993 American comedy horror fantasy film '' Hocus Pocus '' and the 1899 French film '' Cinderella '' . Julien Goncalves of Pure Charts compared parts of the video 's concept to Madonna 's live performance of " Vogue " ( 1990 ) at the 1990 MTV Video Music Awards . In a negative review , Highsnobiety 's Gorsler wrote : " The visuals are , to put it kindly , less than stellar , with over-the-top production and a lavishly nonsensical plot making the music video one of the weirdest things to come out this year . But all that is to be expected from an artist like Katy Perry , who is famous for her eccentricity . " He also criticized the heavy product placement and the use of an air horn rap trumpet sound at the beginning of the video , which " sound s like Katy Perry spent a little too much time playing around with Virtual DJ " . '' Vice '' magazine also slightly criticized the product placement sequences

		CONTEXT=The " Take a Bow " video was a source of inspiration for Justin Timberlake 's music video for his 2006 single , " SexyBack " . According to Timberlake , he decided to work with director Michael Haussman on his " SexyBack " video because " Take a Bow " is one of his favorite Madonna videos . He went on to say " Even today , I still remember the visuals , the images , how he captured her . A lot of times , Madonna seems like she 's the person in control , and in that video , she seemed vulnerable . It was a cool thing to see . " According to director Dave Meyers , the music video for Britney Spears ' 2009 single " Radar " is a " tribute " to Madonna 's " Take a Bow " video . When speaking of Spears and the " Radar " video , Meyers explained , " we were looking for a way to take her into a contemporary , classy environment .

Babyface said the performance was terrifying for him : " I was nervous as hell . But you could n't actually see my legs shaking under the suit . When we finished , she told me she had never been that nervous before . That was crazy to me -- I was thinking , ' You 're Madonna , you 're on stage all the time ! ' " . On February 18 , 1995 , Madonna arrived in Europe to promote '' Bedtime Stories '' ; that same day , she appeared on German TV show '' Wetten , dass . . ?

At the end of the performance , she thanked the audience in Italian language , and received standing ovation . Madonna did rehearse the song for 2004 's Re-Invention World Tour , but it was ultimately cut from the setlist and not included in the show

		GOLD_MENTION=2004 bombings of hotels
		CONTEXT=The Elmasry affair led to criticisms that the media focussed entirely on the comments of the CIC president while neglecting controversial comments made on the same program by a B'nai Brith official , Adam Aptowitzer , who stated that " When Israel uses terror ... to destroy a home and convince people ... to be terrified of what the possible consequences are , I 'd say that 's an acceptable use to terrify somebody . " The remarks only received attention several weeks after the broadcast , and after Elmasry 's apology and proffered resignation , when a press release by the Canadian Arab Federation highlighted them . Following the CAF press release , Aptowitzer retracted his comments and resigned his position with the B'nai Brith . '' Toronto Star '' city editor John Ferri told the '' Toronto Star '' 's ombud , Don Sellar , " we all had egg on our faces ... i t was embarrassing for every paper in the city not to get the whole story from the outset . " In a letter to the '' Toronto Star '' following Sellar 's column , Elmasary complained about the affair : Canadian news media - including the Star - launched a relentless and unfair attack against the Canadian Islamic Congress ( CIC ) and me while covering up for weeks the outrageous statements made on the same show by Adam Aptowitzer , then the Ontario chairman of the B'nai Brith Institute of International Affairs . While never referring to Aptowitzer 's statements , the media used news stories , editorials , op-ed pieces , columns , photos , front-page coverage , cartoons , and radio and television commentaries to paint a negative picture of CIC and myself which seriously distorts and falsifies the truth . It was widely reported , for example , that " Elmasry said all Israelis over 18 were legitimate targets for suicide bombers . " This is totally false . The media never questioned the completeness or the accuracy of the radio show transcript that was given to them . Instead , they totally and completely relied on the heavily selective one provided to them , which was one-sided and referred only to my remarks , but not to those by Aptowitzer . Elmasry also criticized Canadian Jewish groups over this incident . In an article entitled " When Jews Target a Canadian Muslim " , Elmasry accused the Canadian Jewish Congress ( CJC ) and Bnai Brith Canada of " putting pressure on my university to fire me " and that his words were " mis-represented to the public exactly as the CJC wished " . He also stated that " a Toronto Jewish businessman had threatened to withdraw his financial support for a chair of Jewish studies . " He also criticized the 2004 bombings of hotels in Taba , Egypt on the grounds that some of the victims there were not Israelis . These remarks prompted harshly-worded responses from representatives of the Canadian Jewish Congress and several prominent Canadian Muslims . At first , Elmasry defended his remarks by insisting that he was merely sharing the standard Palestinian point of view . This led to further charges from his critics , who accused him of using the Palestinians as a scapegoat . In a letter to the '' Toronto Star '' , he denied having said what he was reported to have said

		CONTEXT=Mithiborwala wrote that the Mumbai 26/11 attack was carried out by the CIA and Mossad , its objective being to establish a pro-US/Israeli consensus among Indians , allowing the US/Israeli political elite " to deploy our Military into the war theatre in Afghanistan . " In June 2011 Mithiborwala wrote that David Headley , who was involved with planning the 26/11 attack , was " a CIA-FBI operative whose task was to organize & expedite the Mumbai 26/11 terror attacks . " He wrote that the attacks were the result of a CIA/Saudi Arabian/Mossad conspiracy , saying " The strategic period & the timing of the terror attacks are a pointer to the powers behind the perpetrators . " Mithiborwala believes that Osama bin Laden has been dead since the latter half of December 2001 . He expressed his belief that the parties saying he was still alive were doing this because " The ghost of Bin Laden serves multiple purposes both at the Global and Indian context " , mainly to generate fear for the Hindu community and to be a " false hero " for Muslims , falsely inspiring youth to follow the " flawed path of extremism and terror . " When several small bombs were set off in Pune on 1 August 2012 , Mithiborwala and Kishore Jagtap called them a " Chitpawan Brahmanical-Manuwadi reaction to the restoration of the true Samadhi-Burial Shrine of Saibai , the first wife of Shivaji Maharaj , " and thus " part of the ongoing caste war that has once again erupted all across Maharashtra . " After the 21 February 2013 terrorist bombing in Hyderabad , Mithiborwala charged the ruling Indian Congress Party with staging it to win conservative Hindu votes . He claimed the bombing would be blamed on fictitious " ' Sleeper Cells ' of disgruntled Muslim youth , who will begin to be picked up from the lanes of this city , " and most of whom " will be police informers & petty criminals who will be entrapped into owning up for this terror attack . " Both the Pune and Hyderabad bombings were believed to have been carried out by the Indian Mujahideen

		CONTEXT=In early August 2012 , Israel 's National Security Council 's counter-terrorism bureau renewed its travel advisory against visiting the Sinai Peninsula , due to information on potential terrorist attacks against tourists , including kidnappings . The warning may have been due to Hamas ' release of Abu Walid al-Maqdisi , a Salafi leader of an al-Qaeda-affiliated terrorist group , responsible for three bombings in Dahab in 2006 , and which is believed to have close ties with terror cells operating in the Sinai Peninsula . The following day , the United States also issued a travel warning to Americans to " take precautions in travel to the Sinai " and warned that " overland travel from Israel to the Sinai in particular is strongly discouraged . " Over the weekend prior to the attack on the border , various intelligence reports reaching the IDF 's Southern Command warned of an impending attack . Specific information regarding the time , target , and location of the attack could not be ascertained . Still , Southern Command Maj.-Gen . Tal Russo prepared his troops in case of an attack . Armored , Engineering , and Infantry soldiers were placed on high alert while the Israeli Air Force was deployed in the area as reinforcement . Russo evacuated troops from the Kerem Shalom border crossing , where the militants would later break through , in anticipation of them coming under attack

Investigations have shown that these were mainly motivated by a resentment of the poverty faced by many Bedouin in the area . Attacking the tourist industry was viewed as a method of damaging the industry so that the government would pay more attention to their situation . ( See 2004 Sinai bombings , 2005 Sharm El Sheikh bombings and 2006 Dahab bombings ) . Since the 2011 Egyptian Revolution , unrest has become more prevalent in the area including the 2012 Egyptian-Israeli border attack in which 16 Egyptian soldiers were killed by militants .

		CONTEXT=On 4 October 2009 , Fred Halliday , Emeritus Professor of International Relations at the LSE and the School 's leading expert on the Middle East , wrote a memorandum to the LSE Council regarding the proposed cooperation with the Gaddafi Foundation . " I have repeatedly expressed reservations about formal educational and funding links with that country . " While those in favour of accepting the donation argued that " Libya is changing internally , " most informed observers agree that while some of the worst excesses for the moment have ceased , the rights of its people are badly protected . Libya " remains a country run by a secretive , erratic and corrupt elite . " Since 9/11 the Libyan government has reached compromises with the West on a number of issues , notably the Lockerbie bombing and nuclear weapons . Yet tactical changes in foreign policy are not sufficient for the purposes of evaluating political and academic links . There are also ways in which Libyan foreign policy has '' not '' changed : the country continues to call for the destruction of Israel ; Muammar Gaddafi recently called for the abolition of Switzerland , and he receives the leader of the Somali pirates operating off the Horn of Africa as honoured guests of state . Moreover , Libya 's handling of the Lockerbie bombing " has not been characterised by either consistency or clarity , " I have in the past , Halliday noted , defended accepting grants from authoritarian regimes such as the Gulf states , " but there should be clear limits on this , depending on the degree of political and human rights abuses perpetrated with them and on their ongoing foreign policy conduct . " Whitehall and the City are now happy to do business with Libya , but it does not follow that the LSE should do the same . Responsible leaders throughout the Middle East continue to express reservations regarding Libya , including " its more prominent ' liberal ' representatives . " We must remember , Halliday concluded , that the " liberal " wing within a regime such as Libya does not have the function of producing change but its role is instead " to reach compromises with internal hard-liners that serve to lessen external pressure . " A good case in point are the proposals LSE now is considering . It is , as LSE alumni in positions of responsibility in the region caution , " far too early for the School to take this step . " In 2009 , Human Rights Watch was allowed entry to Libya , via Saif al-Islam Gaddafi 's non-profit organization in order to gather facts about the human rights situation there . While HRW reported that there were concerns about the " repressive atmosphere , " they felt there were signs of " improvement " and Sarah Leah Whitson , director of HRW 's Middle East division said that one should not " underestimate the importance of the efforts made so far " by Gaddafi in the realm of human rights in Libya . She also wrote of her official visit that " the real impetus for the transformation rests squarely with a quasi-governmental organization , the Qaddafi Foundation for International Charities and Development " chaired by Gaddafi . She praised Gaddafi for establishing the country 's two semi-private newspapers , and said " it is impossible to underestimate the importance of the efforts made so far . Let 's hope this spring will last . " In January 2011 , HRW criticised other organisations as well as governments that had previously dealt with Gaddafi . HRW Business and Human Rights Director Arvind Ganesan condemned the London School of Economics ( LSE ) for allowing " abusive and corrupt officials or their families to launder their images in exchange for money " . This was later followed by Ganesen saying that " the London School of Economics did not act until Saif al-Islam 's father literally began to kill his own people " . According to NGO Monitor , this was despite the fact that David Held , Co-Director of LSE Global Governance , was partially influenced by Whitson 's remarks regarding her Libyan visit , referring to Saif al-Islam Gaddafi as a reformer

		CONTEXT=The show received a mixed reception from media publications . On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes , the show holds an approval rating of 43 % based on 30 critics , and summarized , " The 90th Academy Awards played it safe and hit no major snags -- but by clocking in at over four hours , returning host Jimmy Kimmel and company wore out their welcome long before the surprise ending . " Hank Stuever of '' The Washington Post '' marked , " In his second year , Kimmel has shown that the telecast need n't be anything but sharp and sure , with a funny host whose bits are manageable , shareable and – best of all – forgotten . We 're not making showbiz history here ; we 're just trying to get through another Oscar night . " Chief critic David Edelstein of '' Vulture '' wrote , " This was the best , most inspiring , and most sheerly likable Academy Awards telecast I 've ever seen . ... It was also – in terms of the actual awards – among the most disappointing . " '' Vanity Fair '' s , Richard Lawson wrote , " As a host , Kimmel struck a careful , appropriately measured tone ... All told , Sunday 's ceremony did an admirable job of recognizing all the turmoil surrounding it while maintaining the silly , chintzy trappings that so many of us tune into the Oscars for . " CNN 's Brian Lowry quipped , " The Oscars are a big , unwieldy beast , which invariably try to serve too many masters . Yet if the intent was ultimately to maintain a celebratory tone without ignoring either the outside world or the elephant in the room throughout this year 's awards , host Jimmy Kimmel and the show itself largely succeeded . " Others were more critical of the show . Television critic Maureen Ryan of '' Variety '' said , " All things considered , the show had a more or less low-key vibe . Normally it takes about two hours for the numbing effect to set in , but despite host Jimmy Kimmel 's best efforts , Sunday 's telecast started to feel a bit languid and low-energy far earlier . " Television critic James Poniewozik of '' The New York Times '' said , " despite the recent upheaval in Hollywood , the ceremony at large still focused mainly on celebration and glitter literally , in the case of the blinding set , which looked as if the ceremony were encased in an enormous geode . There 's also the perennial problem of bloat . The hitch , of course , is that every part of the show has its constituency . " Darren Franich of '' Entertainment Weekly '' wrote , " What fun we had at this year 's Oscars ! Long show , sure , but where to cut it ? " Writing for '' Deadline '' Greg Evans said , " Did the nearly four-hour running time contain any moments for the Oscar ages ? Probably not . " David Wiegand of the '' San Francisco Chronicle '' wrote , " Even the hope that the noise of clapping might keep the audience at home and in the theater awake , there was little of that for anything except the entrance of actors of advance age . " '' The Oregonian '' columnist Kristi Turnquist wrote , " Was it respectful ? Absolutely . Did it make for kind of a dull , earnest Oscars show ? Yeah , kind of . " Attaining 26.5 million U.S. viewers according to Nielsen ratings , the ceremony 's telecast had a 16-percent drop in viewership from last year 's ceremony and had the lowest U.S. viewership in Oscar history . On March 6 , after the final ratings were confirmed , President Donald Trump took to his Twitter account , saying , " Lowest rated Oscars in HISTORY . Problem is , we do n't have stars anymore – except your President ( just kidding , of course ) ! " . In response , Kimmel also tweeted , saying , " Thanks , lowest rated President in HISTORY .

But its charm never quite wears off , for reasons summed up in the title . " Actress Angourie Rice had similar sentiments , writing in an essay that “ it was such a fascinating experience to witness the actors ’ performances turned into van Gogh style paintings . The great thing about this film is that it also made me question what the merging of artforms meant for art , film , and everything in between . ” Giuseppe Sedia of the '' Krakow Post '' praised the impressive visual style of the movie . However , he added , " In their concern to keep the viewers interested , directors Kobiela and Welchman have built an over-narrated and spirit-dampening movie in which the preponderance of the dialogues hinders the viewers ’ immersion into the violent beauty and materiality of Van Gogh ’s oeuvre " . The film won the " Most Popular International Feature " award at the 2017 Vancouver International Film Festival . It was nominated in the Hollywood Music in Media Awards 2017 for Best Original Score in an Animated Film .

		CONTEXT=The division was formed in 1939 as part of the '' Ordnungspolizei '' or Orpo ( uniformed national police ) . While all German police organizations were controlled by Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler in his capacity as Chief of German Police in the Interior Ministry , they were not at this time considered part of the SS , nor was the '' Polizei '' Division on par with the other Waffen-SS divisions . This status was reflected in the quality of the equipment they were issued and their retention of police insignia and rank structure . The division was transferred to the Waffen-SS in 1942 and was upgraded to a '' Panzergrenadier '' division . It fought in France , the Soviet Union , Greece ( where it orchestrated the Distomo massacre ) and Pomerania and surrendered to the Americans in May 1945

		CONTEXT=The following day , the German army began moving in on Rome , and that night the King and Badoglio fled the city for Pescara and then to Bari , leaving a leadership vacuum . The Royal Italian Army , although outnumbering the German soldiers three to one , was leaderless , poorly equipped , and in chaos . After a failed resistance at the Pyramid of Cestius by remaining loyalist soldiers , carabinieri ( including a school of cadets ) , and civilians , the Germans occupied Rome . They announced the imposition of German military law with summary execution for violators . Three days later ( on 12 September ) , Nazi commandos tracked down and rescued Mussolini from his hidden prison in the Gran Sasso and set him up in the puppet regime of the so-called " Republic of Salò " in Northern Italy . In October they rounded up and deported the Jews of Rome for extermination at Auschwitz and also made numerous mass roundups of non-Jewish male civilians for forced labor . Meanwhile , General Mark Clark 's Fifth Army in Salerno suffered severe setbacks , and General Eisenhower and other Allied leaders began concentrating their attention on the imminent invasion of France , temporarily neglecting Italy

		CONTEXT=The Bianca Monticellana or Capra Bianca di Monte San Biagio is an indigenous breed of domestic goat from Lazio in central Italy . It takes its name from the town and comune of Monte San Biagio , which until 1862 was known as Monticelli . It is raised in the provinces of Frosinone and Rome , on the Monti Aurunci , the Monti Ausoni , the Monti Lepini , the Monti delle Mainarde in the Val Comino and on the Monti Prenestini . The area of distribution is very similar to that of the Ciociara Grigia , from which it is however quite distinct . The Bianca Monticellana breed descends from a flock of about 700 head of white goats brought to Monticelli from Villa Latina in about 1850 by the Minchella family of shepherds . It is probably the same breed described as " Bianca Romana " ( " Roman white " ) in the early years of the twentieth century , and not subsequently documented .

		ANSWER=SED Party Control Commission
		GOLD_MENTION=events in Moscow
		CONTEXT=By 1948 it was becoming apparent that the government control structure being unrolled in the Soviet occupation zone was based on careful planning . The key planners were a group of German Communist party members who had spent the Nazi period , including the war years , exiled in Moscow , and survived . On 30 April 1945 the 30 man Ulbricht Group had been flown in from Moscow to " prepare the ground " for the period of Soviet occupation . From the outset there was a certain mutual mistrust between the senior party comrades returning from Moscow , led by Walter Ulbricht and also including Wilhelm Pieck , and others who had survived the war years exiled in western Europe . Suspicion of the western survivors was especially intense where their wartime experiences had involved contact with Americans . Government nervousness increased during the later 1948s in the wider context of growing cold war tensions . In September 1948 the East German leader Walter Ulbricht announced the creation of an SED Party Control Commission , mandated to " lead the fight against hostile agents in the service of foreign powers " . This turned out to be the prelude to a period of purges in East Germany that recalled events in Moscow during the later 1930s . The targets in East Germany were ( again ) identified as " Trotskyists " and " anglo-american agents " . Marie Weiterer 's work for the Unitarian Universalist Service Committee in the south of France and later in Paris had always been undertaken with the full agreement of the leadership of the exiled German Communist party , but in the new spirit of the age it was nevertheless now characterised by the East German authorities as amounting to espionage activity undertaken in the service of Noel Field . On 1 September 1950 the party Central Committee published the text of a resolution dated 24 August 1950 ( identified as the " Field resolution " ) which excluded various senior party officers from party membership . Those accused were then sent into what amounted to " internal exile " . The most senior of these was Paul Merker . Maria Weiterer was another of those excluded from the party and stripped of all party related functions

After that and in accordance to orders given specifically to EDES by the Allied forces to push them out of the area , fierce fighting occurred between the two sides . According to British reports , the Cham collaborationist bands managed to flee to Albania with all of their equipment , together with half million stolen cattle as well as 3,000 horses , leaving only the elderly members of the community behind . On 18 June 1944 , EDES forces with Allied support launched an attack on Paramythia . After short-term conflict against a combined Cham-German garrison , the town was finally under Allied command .

He was also one of the architects of the 1929 Lateran Treaty , which ended the " Roman Question " ( a dispute over the status of the papacy since the Italian unification ) , and recognized the sovereignty of Vatican City , which made it an actor of international relations . A claimed attempt to assassinate Venturi with a paper knife ( actually the result of a homosexual lovers ' quarrel ) , one year before the treaty 's completion , made headlines around the world . Venturi had begun the process of reconciliation by convincing Mussolini to donate the valuable library of the Palazzo Chigi to the Vatican .

		ANSWER=Monday Night Football
		GOLD_MENTION=assassination
		CONTEXT=On November 24 , 1963 , the NFL played its full schedule of seven games ( untelevised due to uninterrupted coverage of the assassination , but well-attended ) , only two days after the assassination of President Kennedy , while the rival American Football League ( AFL ) postponed its four games out of respect for the fallen president . Rozelle soon came to regret his decision to have the NFL play , and frequently stated publicly that it had been his worst mistake . However , Rozelle and White House Press Secretary Pierre Salinger had been classmates at the University of San Francisco years before , and Rozelle had consulted with him . Salinger urged Rozelle to play the games . Rozelle felt that way , saying that " it has been traditional in sports for athletes to perform in times of great personal tragedy . " He also said that football was Kennedy 's game and the late president thrived on competition . Rozelle 's " aptitude for conciliation " with the league 's owners and his work in expanding the NFL , however , led to his receiving '' Sports Illustrated '' magazine 's 1963 " Sportsman of the Year " award . The award was ironic , since it was the existence of the '' AFL '' that expanded the sport and forced the NFL to grant franchises to Dallas and Minnesota . By 1965 , the rival American Football League was firmly established , with a new NBC-TV contract , and a new superstar in New York Jets quarterback Joe Namath . After an NFL team ( the Giants ) had signed an AFL player ( the Buffalo Bills ' Pete Gogolak ) in early 1966 , American Football League commissioner Al Davis had shaken the NFL . Davis had immediately started signing NFL stars such as Roman Gabriel , John Brodie and Mike Ditka to contracts with AFL teams . Fearful of their league 's collapse , NFL owners , without the knowledge of Rozelle , approached AFL owners ( without the knowledge of Davis ) and requested merger talks . AFL and NFL executives including Lamar Hunt , founder of the AFL and owner of the Kansas City Chiefs , completed a plan . Rozelle is erroneously credited with forging the merger . In October 1966 , he did testify to Congress to convince them to allow the merger , promising that if they permitted it , '' " Professional football operations will be preserved in the 23 cities and 25 stadiums where such operations are presently being conducted . " '' ; and '' " Every franchise of both leagues will remain in its present location . " '' The merger was allowed , but despite Rozelle 's promises , numerous NFL teams have since moved , or used the threat of moving to have cities build or improve stadiums . Following the urging of American Football League commissioner Al Davis , Rozelle also agreed to the creation of the Super Bowl and later supported the concept of '' Monday Night Football '' . NFL sources have since aggrandized Rozelle 's part in both the merger and Monday Night Football . Rozelle is also often erroneously credited with introducing the concept of shared television revenues to professional football . He did advocate it for the merged NFL , but he was simply embracing the concept which had been implemented by the AFL ten years before the merger

		CONTEXT=The Fortified Sector of the Dauphiné ( Secteur Fortifié du Dauphiné ) was the French military organization that in 1940 controlled the section of the Alpine Line portion of the Maginot Line facing Italy in the vicinity of Briançon . By comparison with the integrated defenses of the main Maginot Line , or even of the Fortified Sector of the Maritime Alps to the south , the Dauphiné sector consisted of a series of distinct territories that covered two main invasion routes into France : the route from Turin over the Col de Montgenèvre to Briançon and Grenoble , and the route from Coni over the Col de Larche to Barcelonette and Gap . The sector was the scene of probing attacks by Italian forces during the Italian invasion of France in 1940 , in which the French defenses successfully resisted Italian advances until the June 1940 armistice that granted Italy access to southeastern France .

		CONTEXT=At the beginning of 1999 , Wright was kept off WCW television for an extended length of time until May , when Wright came up with his own idea for a gimmick : Promotional spots began appearing on WCW television featuring Wright as a surprising new Rivethead-style character named Berlyn ( an intentional misspelling of the city Berlin , the capital of Wright 's home country Germany ) , with a black Mohawk and goatee replacing his blond hair . He was clad entirely in black with a long trench coat and arrogantly refused to speak English . He spoke through an interpreter — Uta Ludendorff — and was accompanied to the ring by a large wrestler known as The Wall . The promos coincided with the aftermath of the Columbine school massacre , which threw a hitch in WCW 's plans . Sensing the unintentional similarities in dress between Berlyn and the teenage killers , WCW delayed the debut of Berlyn for several months . During his debut on August 30 on '' Nitro '' , he quickly insulted Americans , debuting the character as a heel

		ANSWER=Montreal Massacre
		GOLD_MENTION=Montreal massacre
		CONTEXT=Adam Thrasher argued that the " Take Back the Night " marches cause polarization in gender relations , since women discourage men from participating . Thrasher said , as paraphrased by Dan Lazin of '' The Gateway '' , that " unthinking men may be incited to further hatred towards women . " Thrasher argued that while the strips criticize " the ideas of some hard-core feminists , " they are not against all women . Thrasher added that " The reason I did it is because it 's such a taboo to make fun of violence against women , against Take Back the Night . " Thrasher also stated that " When I drew up the cartoon , I was n't thinking about Marc Lepine and the Montreal massacre which was a crime against humanity , I think , more than a crime against women . " A Saturday October 25 , 1997 , editorial of '' The Globe and Mail '' argued that the actions against Thrasher were censorship and that " the instinct to block the juvenile humour was more disturbing than the juvenalia itself . " The '' Alberta Report '' said in 1997 that " '' Space Moose '' is a festival of caricatured scatology , violence , perversion , irreligion and even pedophilia . It has stimulated outrage before , but in five years the university had never suppressed the strip , despite lampoons of University institutions , Trekkies , the mentally retarded , and Christians . Only one group , it seems , has the clout to make the university turn censor . " In response to Thrasher 's argument that the marches could polarize gender relations and that the comic had a different message than perceived , Gretchen Hess said that the intent of the strip was not easily discernible and that the effect of the strip should be considered in addition to the intent . Linda Trimble argued that " t he pretty direct message of the cartoon was ' It 's open season on feminists . Kill all the women . " Joyce Green , a University of Regina political science professor who was another complainant , argued that " I do n't see any difference between the Montreal Massacre and the cartoon . " Green added that the group had complained about the strips " not because we 're paranoid but because we 're terrified . " Shannon Sampert , a political science student who was another one of the complainants , said that she was not surprised that the appeal went in favor of Thrasher . She believed that additional students would try to take the course of action that Thrasher took , and she believed that Feminists would cause an outcry against the appeals

		GOLD_MENTION=45th Golden Globe Awards
		CONTEXT=Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 75 % based on reviews from 51 critics , with an average rating of 6.8 / 10 . The site 's critical consensus reads , " One of Steven Spielberg 's most ambitious efforts of the 1980s , '' Empire of the Sun '' remains an underrated gem in the director 's distinguished filmography . " By comparison , Metacritic calculated an average score of 62 out of 100 based on 22 reviews , indicating " generally favorable reviews " . J. G. Ballard gave positive feedback , and was especially impressed with Christian Bale 's performance . Critical reaction was not universally affirmative , but Richard Corliss of '' Time '' stated that Spielberg " has energized each frame with allusive legerdemain and an intelligent density of images and emotions . " Janet Maslin from '' The New York Times '' called the film " a visual splendor , a heroic adventurousness and an immense scope that make it unforgettable . " Julie Salamon of '' The Wall Street Journal '' wrote that the film as " an edgy , intelligent script by playwright Tom Stoppard , Spielberg has made an extraordinary film out of Mr. Ballard 's extraordinary war experience . " J. Hoberman from '' The Village Voice '' decried that the serious subject was undermined by Spielberg 's " shamelessly kiddiecentric " approach . Roger Ebert gave a mixed reaction , " Despite the emotional potential in the story , it did n't much move me . Maybe , like the kid , I decided that no world where you can play with airplanes can be all that bad . " On his TV show with Gene Siskel , Ebert said that the film " is basically a good idea for a film that never gets off the ground . " Siskel added , " I do n't know what the film is about . It 's so totally confused and taking things from different parts . On one hand , if it wants to say something about a child 's - eye view of war , you got a movie made by John Boorman called '' Hope and Glory '' that was just released that is much better , and much more daring in showing the whimsy that children 's view of war is . On the other hand , this film wants to hedge its bet and make it like an adventure film , so you 've got like '' Indiana Jones '' with the John Malkovich character helping the little kid through all the fun of war . I do n't know what Spielberg wanted to do . " The film won awards from the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures for Best Film and Best Director , and Bale received a special citation for Best Performance by a Juvenile Actor , the first National Board award bestowed on a child actor . At the 60th Academy Awards , '' Empire of the Sun '' was nominated for Art Direction , Cinematography , Editing , Original Music Score , Costume Design ( Bob Ringwood ) , and Sound ( Robert Knudson , Don Digirolamo , John Boyd and Tony Dawe ) . It did not convert any of the nominations into awards . Allen Daviau , who was nominated as cinematographer , publicly complained , " I ca n't second-guess the Academy , but I feel very sorry that I get nominations and Steven does n't . It 's his vision that makes it all come together , and if Steven was n't making these films , none of us would be here . " The film won awards for cinematography , sound design , and music score at the 42nd British Academy Film Awards . The nominations included production design , costume design , and adapted screenplay . Spielberg was honored for this work by the Directors Guild of America , while the American Society of Cinematographers honored Allen Daviau . '' Empire of the Sun '' was nominated for Best Motion Picture ( Drama ) and Original Score at the 45th Golden Globe Awards . John Williams earned a Grammy Award nomination

		GOLD_MENTION=1992 Eurovision Song Contest
		CONTEXT=Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny appears at his back door in his boxers and invites viewers for a look around his house ; including a ( now fully dressed ) encounter with his karaoke machine . He then sets off on his bicycle for an interview at RTÉ . Alas his attempts to get there unscathed come undone when his bike receives a puncture and he has to resort to queueing for a bus like the common person . When the bus arrives , he realises he has no money but after asking for some spare cash from an innocent bystander , he turns around to find the bus has pulled off again . In the RTÉ carpark , Pat Kenny sits in his car , casting his eyes over his fellow broadcasters and enviously longing to join them in their casual conversation . When he finally plucks up the courage to approach Marian Finucane and Joe Duffy , the latter is overheard insulting him and Pat heads back to his car . With Pat due on air in ten minutes , Tom decides to join him in the passenger seat but he must first overcome the clutches of George Hook , who once again attempts to lure him to Newstalk . Pat asks Tom what the world really thinks of him , believing that his assistant is the only person in the world who is loyal to him . Tom attempts to avoid the question , distracting Pat by ( wrongly ) telling him that Enda Kenny has just arrived . Eventually Tom opts to tell Pat , albeit with much hesitation , that he is '' " absolutely unbelievable " '' . At that moment Enda Kenny finally arrives at the studio , still in his biker gear and collapses with exhaustion on the steps having raced through Dublin to make the interview on schedule . Kenny and Kenny square off on air and , with Pat faced with an adversary so similar in perceived personality , popularity and name he is even more unable to cope with his feelings of unworthiness than usual . Pat breaks down live on air , mistaking Enda 's rival , Taoiseach Bertie Ahern , for his own rival , '' Liveline '' presenter Joe Duffy . This prompts Enda to join him in his moment of unrelenting emotion . The next morning Tom arrives at Pat 's house . Pat assumes he has come with his P45 or details of who is to take over the mantle of the station 's highest earning broadcaster . However Tom merely points to two giant sacks of complimentary mail he has carried on his bike from RTÉ headquarters . One of them even wants to sleep with the presenter , who quickly places the letter in the left front pocket of his dressing gown . Pat is astounded to discover he is all over the news and that celebrities such as 1992 Eurovision Song Contest winner Linda Martin , music mogul Louis Walsh and Boyzone lead singer Ronan Keating are talking about him . He hurries indoors to switch on his television . There he finds that figures from the worlds of sport and politics including Irish national football team manager Steve Staunton , Ireland rugby manager Eddie O'Sullivan and Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams are lining up in their droves to pay tribute to him . He is intrigued to find Fintan O'Toole has also spoken greatly of him but becomes irritated when he finds that Steve Staunton seems to have taken over the airwaves , typically reiterating how Pat has done a great job , how he works for the team , has delivered a great result and what else can you say . Meanwhile , Bertie Ahern repeatedly rings Tom 's mobile to request an interview with Pat , but on each occasion Tom tells him to ring back later . Pat and Tom stroll into RTÉ , where George Hook is astounded to hear of Pat 's newfound popularity . He is adamant that Tom will soon join him at Newstalk but Tom shows his unswaying loyalty by declaring he will go only where Pat goes . On Friday night George slips into RTÉ and just as an episode of '' The Late Late Show '' is coming to a close , approaches Pat 's dressing room . George is inadvertently knocked to the floor by a stray microphone where he lies moaning until Pat emerges from the dressing room . Pat steps over George and leaves RTÉ with Tom , telling his assistant that he should not allow anyone to undermine him before demanding that he open the door

		ANSWER=MIND diet is more effective at reducing cognitive decline
		GOLD_MENTION=
		CONTEXT=The Mediterranean - DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay diet , or more commonly , the MIND diet , combines the portions of the DASH ( Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension ) diet and the Mediterranean diet . Both the DASH diet and the Mediterranean diet have been shown to improve cognition ; however , neither were developed to slow neurodegeneration ( e.g. Alzheimer 's disease ) . Therefore , a team at Rush University Medical Center , headed by Martha Clare Morris ( a nutritional epidemiologist ) , worked to create the MIND diet . Like the DASH and Mediterranean diets , the MIND diet emphasizes the intake of fresh fruit , vegetables , and legumes . The MIND diet also includes recommendations for specific foods , like leafy greens and berries , that have been scientifically shown to slow cognitive decline . Recent research has shown that the MIND diet is more effective at reducing cognitive decline than either the Mediterranean or DASH diets alone . Additional testing has shown that the level of adherence to the MIND diet also impacts the diet 's neuro - protective effects .

		CONTEXT=The total population of children in Ghana under the age of 15 is 38.01 % . The youth constitute the most important human resource potential that can contribute significantly to the overall development of a nation . The idea of children on the streets violates the children 's act which states that under no circumstance should a person below the age of fifteen be allowed to work or fend for him or herself . Therefore , the increasing phenomenon of street - ism is a menace . The street children are viewed worldly as problem ( because some of them steal to survive ) rather than people whose first habitat is the street . Obviously , extreme deprivation and social exclusion create opportunities for engaging in crime . Street children are among the most physically visible of all children , living and working on various street corners and public squares in our cities ranging from Aflao to Bawku . Ironically , they are also among the most ' invisible ' , considering that they are the most difficult groups to reach with provision of vital services such as education and healthcare , and thus the hardest to protect . Once on the street , aside being exposed to the mercy of the weather , they are vulnerable to all forms of exploitation and abuse , a life far removed from the childhood envisioned in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child . Street children represent one of the most marginalized groups of children worldwide . They face multiple deprivation of their rights on a daily basis .

The will-they-or-won ' t-they plot does n't work because they 've already been in and out of that relationship too many times . Meredith is a nag and McDreamy is henpecked . " On a more positive note , her relationship with Shepherd was included in AOL TV 's list of the " Best TV Couples of All Time " and in the same list by '' TV Guide '' . During the sixth season the development of the character was praised , Glenn Diaz of '' BuddyTV '' commented that " You got ta love Mer when she 's gloomy . " , in addition to praising Pompeo 's performance . In her review of the episode Tainted Obligation she wrote " I felt for Meredith , but after Lexie 's heartfelt begging and pleading , I was happy that Mere finally grows up and casts her selfishness aside . Three seasons ago Meredith would never have dreamed of putting Lexie first , and I was proud of her for giving up part of her liver — her offer to get to know her dad was an even bigger milestone . " Reviewing the first part of the eighth season , TV Fanatic lauded the character and wrote : " this season belongs to Meredith Grey . She is the '' heart and soul of the show '' and has been outstanding . This is a character that used to be so dark and twisty and has now grown into a more mature woman . Ellen Pompeo has been at the top of her game this season . " '' Wit & Fancy '' praised the transformation of the character and stated , " Of course Meredith will still make rash decisions like when she took off with Zola or tampered with the trial , but she does things out of love and the kindness of her heart now and not because she is dark and twisty . Considering where Meredith was at the beginning and where she is now , I think she went through a remarkable journey and did more than just growing up , she finally became ' all whole and healed ' . " Maura O'Malley of '' Bustle '' also lauded the development of the character ahead of season 12 saying , " When the series began , Meredith was just a girl sitting in a bar celebrating the exciting next phase of her life . She had graduated medical school , she was starting her residency at a prestigious hospital , and she was simply looking for a no-strings attached , one night stand . What she got instead was a complicated romantic relationship that rivals Romeo and Juliet — but the key is , she was n't searching for love . Working and learning were — and continue to be — her priorities , while McDreamy was simply an added perk . Hopefully , the new season of Grey 's Anatomy will reflect this change in tone , because Meredith is a strong , independent woman — and she will be just fine . " Later in the series , Ellen Pompeo received critical acclaim with numerous critics lauding her portrayal of the character . Reviewing the episode She 's Leaving Home '' CarterMatt '' called her the " anchor " for Grey 's saying , " Throughout , this was an episode completely anchored by Ellen Pompeo , who has done some of her best work ever on the show the past couple of weeks . Tonight , she cried , she fought , and she learned that she was carrying his child . " and added that Pompeo is often " ovelooked " saying , " Her subtlety is probably why she is often overlooked . " Rick Porter of '' Zap2it '' reviewing " How to Save a Life " wrote , " Without Meredith , and without one of Pompeo 's strongest performances in her long time on the show , " How to Save a Life " would have run the risk of coming across as a baldly manipulative death episode , the likes of which the show has done several times before . He added . " How to Save a Life " may not be the ideal Emmy-submission episode for Pompeo , considering Meredith is off screen for more than half of it . But it 's among the best work she 's ever done on the show . " '' USA Today '' also lauded Pompeo saying , " In some ways , the episode ( How to Save a Life ) was even more of a showcase for Pompeo . She had some of the more memorable and well-played scenes , from her angry response to the doctor who tries to tell her what her choices are , to her resignation when she realizes she has to comfort and motivate the young doctor whose mistakes cost Derek his life . " The relation between Meredith and Cristina has been acclaimed and been a highlight of the show . Mark Perigard of the Boston Herald considered the friendship to be " the secret core of Grey 's " . Aisha Harris of '' Slate '' called their relation '' The Best Female Friendship on TV '' adding that " With those two characters , showrunner Shonda Rhimes and her team of writers created one of the most nuanced and realistic portrayals of female friendship on television . " Samantha Highfill of '' Entertainment Weekly '' called Cristina and Meredith the best female friends on TV because " they do n't try to be " . There 's nothing fake about them , which is a rarity in how female friends are portrayed on television . She further went on to call them ' soulmates ' , " And even though they 'd never dare get sappy enough to say it , they 're soul mates . Margaret Lyons of Vulture ( magazine ) called the friendship " dream BFF relationship . " and the primary focus of the show , " One of the series ' calling cards has been its depiction of female friendship and particularly the primacy that friendship enjoyed over romantic relationships . " '' E! '' at the time of Sandra Oh 's exit wrote , " In Grey 's Anatomy 's 10-year history , the doctor duo has been through a lot together : weddings , deaths , plane crashes , bomb threats , shooting , you name it , they 've lived ( and danced ) through it . " and added , " And with the three words , ' Y '' ou 're my person . '' ' Cristina Yang and Meredith Grey solidified their status as the small screen 's best best friends ever . " Marama Whyte of '' Hypable '' wrote , " Critically , the key relationship in Meredith 's life was not her romance with Derek Shepherd , but her passionate , indestructible , absolutely enviable friendship with Cristina . Talk about relationship goals ; who wants McDreamy when Cristina Yang could be your person . These two were the real powerhouse , and Shonda Rhimes did n't shy away from making the audience remember this . Derek was the love of her life , but Cristina was her soul mate . More than anyone else , Cristina challenged Meredith , was honest with her and inspired her . For these reasons , it was Cristina who was constantly the source of Meredith 's character development , not Derek . " Pompeo 's character has also been used to define the image a strong woman , '' Bustle '' previewing the 12th season wrote , " Meredith Grey has always been capable of being on her own . Grey 's Anatomy is about Meredith 's journey . Men and romantic interests are a part of her life , but they are not the priority . She does n't need McDreamy . Grey 's Anatomy does n't need McDreamy . So even if the writers do decide to create a new love interest for Ms. Grey ( Martin Henderson , perhaps ? ) , it would n't matter . I have faith that the show 's writers will do this storyline justice , because TV needs more strong single women — and Meredith seems like the perfect candidate . " The site added , " This past season was almost a trial run for a McDreamy-less Grey 's Anatomy . When Derek left for Washington D.C. to pursue his research , Meredith stayed behind and focused on her own career . She did n't chase him . Her priority were her children and the Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital . Meredith showed that she would never put aside her own dreams and aspirations for a man , and I believe that this wo n't change after Derek 's death . " Pompeo has won and has been nominated for multiple awards for her portrayal of Grey . She and the '' Grey 's Anatomy '' cast won Best Ensemble in a Television Series at the 2006 Satellite Awards . During the following year 's ceremony , she was named Best Actress in a Television Drama Series . She was among the '' Grey 's Anatomy '' cast members awarded the Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series accolade at the 13th Screen Actors Guild Awards , and received nominations in the same category in 2006 and 2008 . Pompeo received a Best Performance by an Actress in a Drama Series nomination at the 64th Golden Globe Awards – the program won Best Drama Series at the same ceremony . Also in 2007 , Pompeo and the female cast and crew of '' Grey 's Anatomy '' received the Women in Film Lucy Award , which honors those " whose work in television has positively influenced attitudes toward women . " Pompeo 's performance has garnered her multiple People 's Choice Awards . At the 37th People 's Choice Awards , she was nominated against Dempsey and Oh in the Favorite TV Doctor category , and the following year , she was a contender in the Favorite TV Drama Actress category . Since 2012 , Pompeo has received a nomination at the People 's Choice Awards every year in two categories at 40th People 's Choice Awards alongside Patrick Dempsey and Sandra Oh respectively . She won the Best Drama Actress Award at both the 39th People 's Choice Awards and the 41st People 's Choice Awards . In 2007 , show-business awards reporter Tom O'Neil commented that Pompeo was overdue an Emmy Award nomination for her role in '' Grey 's Anatomy '' . Readers of O'Neil 's awards website , '' The Envelope '' , included Pompeo in their 2009 nominations for Best Drama Actress in the site 's Gold Derby TV Awards . '' Entertainment Weekly '' launched the EWwy Awards in 2008 , to honor actors who have not received Emmy nominations . Pompeo was nominated in the Best Actress in a Drama Series category , and placed fourth , with 19 percent of readers ' votes

		CONTEXT=On behalf of the WJC , Singer also made a number of policy statements . He notably expressed alarm that companies would profit from surging digital sales of Adolf Hitler 's book " Mein Kampf " . Singer told ABC News that " w hile the academic study of Mein Kampf is certainly legitimate , the spike in ebook sales likely comes from neo-Nazis and skinheads idolizing the greatest monster in history , " and added : " We think that responsible companies should n't profiteer from the sales of hate books , or at least should donate the profits to help the victims of anti-Semitism , racism and other like bigotries . " Following the 2014 Gaza conflict and a subsequent surge in anti-Semitic activity , Singer urged European governments to " strengthen police protection of Jewish sites and to ban or disband violent rallies . " He urged them to " stop the agitation and protect their Jewish populations , or Jews will ultimately turn their back on those countries . Jews live in Europe by right , not sufferance . " Addressing a pro-Israel rally in Stockholm , Sweden , on 31 August 2014 , Singer declared : “ Israel and its actions in Gaza are used as an excuse to besiege a synagogue in Paris , to shout ‘ Jews to the gas ’ on the streets of Berlin , or to attack people wearing a Jewish skullcap . None of this is acceptable , and it is high time that European leaders stand up against these expressions of antisemitism and take action . ” In September 2014 , it was announced that the World Jewish Congress would play a leading role in preparing the commemorative events in Auschwitz marking the 70th anniversary of the liberation of the notorious Nazi death camp , in January 2015 .

		ANSWER=Janet Jackson
		GOLD_MENTION=1987 MTV Video Music Awards
		CONTEXT=Jam and Lewis were the primary instrumentalists for the recording , including percussion , piano , drums , and also provided background vocals . Jackson accompanied Jam and Lewis on keyboard and took part in composing the arrangements . Stephen Holden of '' The New York Times '' observed the album was prominent example of the developing relationship with musicians and modern technology , stating " ... technology has altered the form , shape , scale and even the meaning of popular music ... The album was n't created by a studio band , as were most pop-rock albums in the 1960s and '70s , but by the producers and the singer programming mechanized drum and keyboard textures . " Jackson 's father disapproved of the new material and image of '' Control '' , claiming it would never sell . In a cover story for '' Spin '' magazine titled " Damn It , Janet : The Battle for Control of Janet Jackson , " Joseph was reported saying " i f Janet listens to me , she 'll be as big as Michael . " She and McClain disregarded his objections . Commenting on the final product , Jackson stated : " It 's aggressive , cocky , very forward . It expresses exactly who I am and how I feel . I 've taken control of my own life . This time I 'm gon na do it my way . " Fashion photographer and illustrator Tony Viramontes created the stylized cover for the new album and the singles '' Nasty '' and '' Control '' . Jackson said of Viramontes , " He was very creative , and I believe one day his work will be iconic . He was such a joy to work with . I miss him . " Author Dean Rhys Morgan in '' Bold , Beautiful and Damned : The World of Fashion Illustrator Tony Viramontes '' discusses how Jackson was " transformed from a former child star into an assured fashion forward figure with her trendsetting big hair and severe all black ensemble . Until this point , Jackson had been more a reflection than pioneer , more interpreter than innovator . This album was all about Janet and who she wanted to be . " Alexander Fury wrote in '' The Independent '' , " the artwork created with Eighties illustrator Tony Viramontes for '' Control '' stands the test of time . " Although A&M did not consider a full concert tour to promote Jackson 's album , the label funded a three-week promotional tour across the United States in 13 cities following its release . In addition to the studio release , a remix album , '' Control : The Remixes '' , was released in select countries in November , 1987 . Jackson 's lyrical expression has been noted as one of the key elements of the album 's success . Author Dave Marsh in '' The Heart of Rock & Soul : The 1001 Greatest Singles Ever Made '' ( 1999 ) comments : " Certainly , Janet must have written her own lyrics , which went after men — in particular , not very well disguised stand-ins for her father and former husband — more venomously than another guy would have dared . '' Control '' , the resulting album , was one of the best-sellers of 1986 – 1987 , producing five hit singles . " Jesus Garber , then-director of A&M 's black music marketing and promotion , noted that in addition to crossover promotion from black to pop music charts , music video was utilized to launch Jackson into super stardom . Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine credits the release of '' Control '' as " the birth of Janet the music video star , as six of the nine tracks were turned into popular videos that all but announced her as queen of the production dance number . " Henderson commented that Jackson 's dancing ability , trained by a then-unknown Paula Abdul , only served to propel her into further stardom . Charlie Minor , then-senior vice president of promotion for A&M stated : " The images completed the image of Janet Jackson with the buyer ... They gave her a face , dance , action identity with the songs , and a visual image of her as a rock 'n' roll star . " Jonathan Cohen of '' Billboard '' magazine commented " Jackson 's accessible sound and spectacularly choreographed videos were irresistible to MTV , and helped the channel evolve from rock programming to a broader , beat-driven musical mix . " The video for " Nasty " received three nominations for the fifth annual 1987 MTV Video Music Awards , winning Best Choreography for Paula Abdul

		GOLD_MENTION=VMAs
		CONTEXT=After the commercial lackluster of her eighth studio album , '' Britney Jean '' ( 2013 ) , Spears started her Las Vegas residency show , Britney : Piece of Me , which attained commercial success . Later , in September 2014 , Spears posted a picture of herself in the studio , hinting that she was recording new music . In another interview , a month later , she revealed that she was working " very slowly , but progressively " on the album . In 2015 , she released the song " Pretty Girls " with Iggy Azalea , however the song was met with moderate impact and Spears headed back to the studio to record more songs , but did n't have plans to release a new album . In November 2015 , Spears teased on her Instagram account that she was working with songwriters Justin Tranter and Julia Michaels , by posting a picture of them looking " bemused " with the caption : " Working hard and hardly working ... new album ... wheeeee ! . " A month later , Tranter gave an interview for website NewNowNext about his work with Spears and commented : " Working with Britney is a fucking dream . She is so sweet , so inspiring and a master on the mic . Me and Julia had to leave the studio one day because our screams of excitement after every take she did were distracting the producers . " In late 2016 , during interviews to promote the album , Spears declared that she wanted to explore new things on the record , and that it was her " most hip-hop album , " explaining : " ... there are like two or three songs that go in the direction of more urban that I 've wanted to do for a long time now , and I just have n't really done that . " In May 2016 , in an exclusive interview for website '' Breathe Heavy '' , Tranter revealed : " Nobody ever talks about Britney as a writer and she ’s f " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " was written by Mattias Larsson , Robin Fredriksson , Julia Michaels , Justin Tranter and Sandy Chila , with production being done by Mattman & Robin . Mattman & Robin were also responsible for programming , drums , percussion , snaps , handclaps , synths , guitars , bass and kalimba , while Michaels and Jermaine Jackson provided background vocals . It was recorded at 158 Studios , Westlake Village , California , The Studio at the Palms , Las Vegas , Nevada , and at Wolf Cousins Studios , Stockholm , Sweden . " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is an electropop , and dance-pop song that lasts for three minutes and twenty-two seconds ( 3:22 ) . It features " subtle keyboards , a strummed guitar , " and " wobbly bass " in its instrumentation . For Brian Josephs of '' Spin '' , the song 's guitar slaps " recall her 2001 single ' I 'm a Slave 4 U. ' " Other critics also felt that the " strummed flamenco guitar " on the song is similar to those on Justin Timberlake 's " Like I Love You " . Bianca Gracie of '' Fuse '' opined that the song reminded her of " the glory days ( no pun intended ) of ' Circus ' and ' Femme Fatale ' . " Lyrically , " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is a flirty song about Spears " offer ing several reasons why her lover should come over and options , which can be seen in the lines " Nobody should be alone if they do n't have to be " and " I could get into that kissin ' and touchin ' / Or we could be good and do next to nothin ' . " Amy Roberts of '' Bustle '' noted that the lyrics are about hooking up , adding that they " celebrate the idea that casual relationships do n't need to be lacking respect or understanding . You do n't have to be in love with , or committing to , the person that you 're hooking up with , but that also does n't mean that you ca n't connect with them on a different level than just sex . In fact , Spears makes it clear that it 's kind of even cool if her hook-up does n't want to have sex . Her partner can draw the boundaries of where the massage she 's offering starts and ends , and if it remains as nothing more than a back rub then so be it – that 's totally cool . " For Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine , the song features " some dubious lyrics that seem to suggest masturbatory self-love " in the lines : " All I want is what you want/And all you want is me . " The chorus of the song features " a shouted gang " of backup singers , singing : " Whatever you want / whatever you need / I 'll do it ! . " Lewis Corner of Digital Spy called it " a thumping pop anthem , " praising " Britney 's seductive vocal delivery . " Gil Kaufman of '' Billboard '' named it a " fun , flirty " track . Bianca Gracie of '' Fuse '' described it as a " pulsating track that is a flirty booty call that is bound to own the dance floor . " Robbie Daw of Idolator found it to be " a traditional Spears-style chunk of dance-pop " and " arguably the best yet , with its thick whomping bass and that sparkling ' nobody should be alone if they do n't have to be ' breakdown . " Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine called it " impeccably produced downstairs music , " adding that it " is an irresistible slice of dance-pop , with an ebullient bassline and staccato acoustic guitar . " Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic declared that " some of the highlights on the album are the silliest songs , " citing " Do You Wan na Come Over " 's " overheated flamenco chorus " as an example . Maura Johnston of '' Boston Globe '' said the song was one of the album 's high points , noting that the song " is jolted to life by the slashed guitars that helped make ' Toxic ' a pop thrill . " John Murphy of musicOMH was positive while noting that the track " has a rush and urgency about it which marks it out as one of the album 's best songs . " Nolan Feeney of '' Entertainment Weekly '' also picked it as a highlight , praising the " acoustic guitars and gurgling bass lines that make for one freaky pop experiment . " Alex Macpherson of '' The Guardian '' wrote that the song " takes the party back to Britney 's heyday , " praising the inclusion of the flamenco guitar . For '' Los Angeles Times '' writer Mikael Wood , the song " restore s some of the sonic invention that once defined Spears ' biggest hits . " Nick Levine , writing for '' NME '' , echoed the same thought , writing : " The lusty strut of ‘ Do You Wan na Come Over ? ’ nods to her early-noughties Neptunes-produced hits . " In his Vice column , Robert Christgau selected " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " and " Clumsy " as his favorite tracks on the album .

		CONTEXT=" Motivation " is a R&B slow jam song written by Richard Butler ( Rico Love ) , Jim Jonsin , Dwayne Carter and Danny Morris . The racy lyrics center around Rowland asking her man to use his hands all over her body , and are accompanied by a " synth-saturated beat " produced by Jonsin . In terms of instruments , " Motivation " uses sparse keyboard notes , programmed beats and pulsing synths in the chorus . Wayne adds a rap verse complementing Rowland 's seductive suggestions , using the kitchen and a car as metaphors for sex . According to Scott Shetler from AOL Music , Rowland uses the lyrics to promise " to be her lover 's motivation . " Rowland called the record a mixture between dance and mash-up . When asked by MTV what Rowland thought of the song , she said , " It has that personality and characteristic to it that I do n't think anybody can deny . That 's why when Wayne dropped that insane verse on there ... I was like , ' You really brought that up even more . ' He went into the studio and just did it . I do n't think it takes much for Wayne to think . He just does it . He 's so admirable . " Ryan Brockington , from the '' New York Post , '' was amongst the first to review " Motivation . " In his review , he said " The single is a big leap from the dance club synth pop that Kelly has been releasing the past year and it seems like she might be trying to shimmy her way back into the hip-hop world by teaming up with the Midas touch vocals of Lil Wayne . " Both '' Rap-Up '' and AOL Music 's Scott Shetler called the song " sexy . " Becky Bain from Idolator disliked the song for not being memorable . The short review was summed up with the closing phrase , " she ’s going to need another hit to help promote her album when it finally is ready to drop . " Wesley Case from '' The Baltimore Sun '' complemented the song 's sexy quality . " If this is n't the year 's hands-down sexiest song thus far , it has to be in the discussion . Rowland , whose sultry voice could get a priest hot , weaving in and out of the minimal beat , and setting the table for Lil Wayne 's stuttering , after-hours guest-verse . Stack the pieces together and it 's an understated knockout that gets sexier with each spin . " Billboard ranked it number five on their " Critics ' Picks : 20 Best Songs of 2011 " " Motivation " was nominated for two awards at the 2011 Soul Train Music Awards including Best Dance Performance and Song of the Year.It won the award for Song of the Year and was also nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration at the 54th Grammy Awards , which was held on February 12 , 2012

		GOLD_MENTION=assassination
		CONTEXT=In handling the Korean DMZ conflict of 1966 – 1969 , Park Chung-hee enabled industrial progress while suppressing the rights of the South Korean people . According to Major Daniel P. Bolger 's analysis , Park enjoyed the emergency powers at his disposal in the time of conflict , which he preserved until 1979 . The military , intelligence and police forces he consolidated in order to defeat the DPRK and flout the invasion of Ulchin-Samcheok were re-calibrated towards suppressing human rights , domestic opponents and restricting freedom of speech and press . The adoption of the Yusin Constitution on November 21 , 1972 , granted President Park full control over South Korea by co-opting the rule of law until his assassination in 1979 at the hands of secret service chief Kim Jae-kyu . Some historians argue that the consolidation of the military established under Park paved the way for continued authoritarianism even after Park 's demise , as evidenced by General Cheon Hu-hwan 's brief repetition of martial law in 1980 . As a consequence , the accumulation of emergency powers during the time of Ulchin-Samcheok delayed the democratization of South Korea in the long term

After meeting Maharishi Mahesh Yogi at a UNICEF Variety Gala in Paris , Love , along with other high-profile celebrities such as the Beatles and Donovan traveled to Rishikesh in India during February and March 1968 . The following Beach Boys album '' Friends '' had songs influenced by the Transcendental Meditation taught by the Maharishi .

Starting on May 3 , 1968 , the tour lasted five shows and was canceled when the Maharishi had to withdraw to fulfill film contracts . Because of disappointing audience numbers and the Maharishi 's withdrawal , twenty-four tour dates were subsequently canceled at a cost estimated at $ 250,000 for the band .

		CONTEXT=Schaffner likens the Beatles ' 1966 recordings to the moment of transformation in the film '' Wizard of Oz '' , " where , when Dorothy discovers herself transported from Kansas to Oz , the film dramatically changes from black-and-white to glorious technicolor " . The album was the source of confusion for the group 's more conservative fans ; a female fan later complained in '' Beatles Monthly '' that 1966 represented the end of " The Beatles we used to know before they went stark , raving mad " . The release coincided with a period of public relations challenges for the band , the combination of which led to their decision to retire from touring following the end of their North American tour , on 29 August . In the US , the album 's release was a secondary event to the controversy surrounding the recent publication there of Cleave 's interview with Lennon , in which he had remarked that the Beatles had become " more popular than Jesus " . This episode followed the unfavourable reaction to the '' Yesterday and Today '' butcher sleeve , from the press , radio stations and retail outlets . As a result , at press conferences during the tour , questions were typically focused on religious matters rather than the band 's new music .

		ANSWER=Wah - Wah
		GOLD_MENTION=
		CONTEXT=" Wah - Wah " is a song by English rock musician George Harrison from his 1970 triple album All Things Must Pass . Harrison wrote the song following his temporary departure from the Beatles in January 1969 , during the troubled Get Back sessions that resulted in their Let It Be album and film . The lyrics reflect his frustration with the atmosphere in the group at that time – namely , Paul McCartney 's over-assertiveness and criticism of his guitar playing , John Lennon 's lack of engagement with the project and dismissal of Harrison as a songwriter , and Yoko Ono 's constant involvement in the band 's activities . Music critics and biographers recognise the song as Harrison 's statement of personal and artistic freedom from the Beatles . Its creation contrasted sharply with his rewarding collaborations outside the group in the months before the Get Back project , particularly with Bob Dylan and the Band in upstate New York .

		GOLD_MENTION=tour that started in West Germany
		CONTEXT=By 1966 , the Beatles had grown weary of live performance . In John Lennon 's opinion , they could " send out four waxworks ... and that would satisfy the crowds . Beatles concerts are nothing to do with music anymore . They 're just bloody tribal rites . " In June that year , two days after finishing the album '' Revolver '' , the group set off for a tour that started in West Germany . While in Hamburg they received an anonymous telegram stating : " Do not go to Tokyo . Your life is in danger . " The threat was taken seriously in light of the controversy surrounding the tour among Japan 's religious and conservative groups , with particular opposition to the Beatles ' planned performances at the sacred Nippon Budokan arena . As an added precaution , 35,000 police were mobilised and tasked with protecting the group , who were transported from hotels to concert venues in armoured vehicles . The Beatles then performed in the Philippines , where they were threatened and manhandled by its citizens for not visiting First Lady Imelda Marcos . The group were angry with their manager , Brian Epstein , for insisting on what they regarded as an exhausting and demoralising itinerary

		ANSWER=What Goes Around
		GOLD_MENTION=2015 Country Music Association Awards
		CONTEXT=Unlike his previous record primarily focused on R&B and pop genres , '' FutureSex/LoveSounds '' is less concentrated on one particular sound , thus representing a wider range . Timberlake explains , " It 's more broad as far as the styles I wanted to mix in to my own type of thing . " A musically " complex " album , '' FutureSex/LoveSounds '' is a fusion of rap , rock , funk , soul , gospel , new wave , opera , and world music , characterized by preludes and interludes interspersed on the album 's tracks . '' Entertainment Weekly '' noted that the album 's sound is a " sonic departure " from both NSYNC and '' Justified '' . Although " What Goes Around " sounds similar to '' Justified '' , Timberlake admitted that it is the only song in the new album to have such similarity . '' The 20/20 Experience '' is a neo soul album partly inspired by the expansive song structures of 1960s and 1970s rock . Mikael Wood of the '' Los Angeles Times '' found its elaborate structures ambitious in the vein of Stevie Wonder , Prince , and Michael Jackson . Since his marriage , he incorporated themes of romance in his songwriting , as '' Complex '' noted , showing that he " writes his tracks on his emotions , leaving him with a career of personal albums . " Moments of emotional pain after betrayal influenced the songwriting of some previous records . Longtime critic Robert Hilburn for the '' Los Angeles Times '' praised Timberlake 's act after attending the Justified and Stripped Tour in 2003 , considering him " born for the stage ( with ) the savvy instincts to put together a show that works . Rather than make himself the constant center of attention , he was comfortable enough at times simply to be part of a talented ensemble . " In 2013 , Timberlake introduced his big-band orchestra called the Tennessee Kids for Legends of the Summer and The 20/20 Experience World Tour which includes guitarists , dancers , background singers , drummers , bassists , keyboardists , trumpeters , a music coordinator , a percussionist , a saxophonist , among others musicians . The 20/20 Experience allowed Timberlake to throw back to the big-band era , its stage production embraced a vintage sheen and everyone in classic suits . For the tour , Timberlake had a horn section onstage with him called The Regiment Horns . '' The Hollywood Reporter '' 's Emily Zemler described him as a performer who is " genuinely having fun , " whereas Jon Pareles of '' The New York Times '' commented that the singer " reveals something darker , more fiery and intense " while performing post-breakup revenge songs , such as " Cry Me a River " and " What Goes Around ... Comes Around " . '' Billboard '' editor Phil Gallo praised Timberlake 's medley performance at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards , saying he " gave the show its heart and center , " also mentioning his place as a modern recording artist and a solid link in the lineage of the most acclaimed performers in the show 's history . '' The New York Times ' '' editor Katie Rogers highlighted Timberlake 's crossover appeal after his performance with Chris Stapleton at the 2015 Country Music Association Awards . Described by critics as a " consummate showman , " Timberlake usually plays guitar , piano and keyboard in his shows

		CONTEXT=The Beach Boys were at their lowest popularity in the late 1960s , and their cultural standing was especially worsened by their public image , which remained incongruous with the " heavier " music of their peers . From 1968 onward , Brian 's songwriting output declined substantially , but the public narrative of " Brian-as-leader " continued . After meeting Maharishi Mahesh Yogi at a UNICEF Variety Gala in Paris , Love , along with other high-profile celebrities such as the Beatles and Donovan traveled to Rishikesh in India during February and March 1968 . The following Beach Boys album '' Friends '' had songs influenced by the Transcendental Meditation taught by the Maharishi . In support of the '' Friends '' album , Love had arranged for the Beach Boys to tour with the Maharishi in the U.S. . Starting on May 3 , 1968 , the tour lasted five shows and was canceled when the Maharishi had to withdraw to fulfill film contracts . Because of disappointing audience numbers and the Maharishi 's withdrawal , twenty-four tour dates were subsequently canceled at a cost estimated at $ 250,000 for the band . '' Friends '' , released on June 24 , peaked at number 126 in the US . A collection of Beach Boys backing tracks , '' Stack-o-Tracks '' , was issued by Capitol in August .

In the chorus , Vikki sings that " love is " the product of a number of impulsive decisions , such as " taking a chance on two hearts beating as one .

		GOLD_MENTION=2010 AFL Rising Star
		CONTEXT=He arrived at the club as an incredibly shy and underdeveloped personality , a fact that was noted by teammate Trent Cotchin who said though Martin was 18 “ he seemed much younger in some of the ways he behaved . ” Indeed , he struggled initially to adjust to the expectations of professional football . In one incident in the 2010 preseason he was removed from training and verbally reprimanded by club leadership when he was deemed unfit to train after a big night out . Despite these struggles , his on-field development was such that he would still debut in the 2010 season 's opening match , a 56-point Richmond loss against at the MCG . Martin recorded the sixth most disposals of any Tiger ( 18 ) to go along with four marks , three tackles and three clearances . Two weeks later Martin was convicted by the AFL tribunal for a high hit on Sydney 's Josh Kennedy in round 3 . He did not receive a suspension for the incident however , returning to football the following week . After four matches Martin ranked fourth in the league for clearances and eighth for hard-ball gets . Media reports emerged after round 8 that the 18 year old Martin had received a significant contract offer from expansion club the Greater Western Sydney Giants . The offer , which the Herald Sun ’s Mark Robinson claimed to be worth $ 2.4 million over three seasons , would have taken effect in the new club 's first AFL season in 2012 . Martin later said he had never entertained the idea of moving to the start-up club . In round 10 he had gained attention for his on-field efforts again , this time being nominated for the 2010 AFL Rising Star award after a 21 disposal and 11 clearance match against Port Adelaide . Due to his previous tribunal conviction however , Martin was ruled ineligible for the award and thus did not officially place in the end of season award 's points tally . He drew the attention of Sydney coach Paul Roos by round 14 , prompting Roos to send veteran Brett Kirk onto Martin in a tagging role . Despite this extra attention , he still managed to record 18 disposals and a goal in the match at the MCG . After 17 rounds Martin ranked second at the club for clearances and inside 50s as well as third for disposals and contested possessions . At the same time he ranked first among that season 's Rising Star nominees in clearances , contested possessions and inside 50s . He was also fourth for average disposals and fifth for average tackles . In round 19 he was rested by the club before returning to play out the final five matches of the season . He missed just that one game in his debut season and finished the year ranked second at Richmond for clearances and inside 50s , as well as third for both contested possessions and disposals . In addition to winning the Fred Swift Medal for fourth place at the club 's best and fairest night , Martin also received six votes in the Brownlow Medal count that year , the most by any Richmond debutant since Craig Lambert in 1988 . At season 's end he reiterated his commitment to the club ( and rejection of the former GWS overtures ) by signing a two-year contract extension that would keep him at Richmond until the end of the 2013 season . The extension was reported by the Herald Sun to be in the vicinity of $ 400,000-a-year

		ANSWER=Do You Wan na Come Over
		GOLD_MENTION=VMAs
		CONTEXT=After the commercial lackluster of her eighth studio album , '' Britney Jean '' ( 2013 ) , Spears started her Las Vegas residency show , Britney : Piece of Me , which attained commercial success . Later , in September 2014 , Spears posted a picture of herself in the studio , hinting that she was recording new music . In another interview , a month later , she revealed that she was working " very slowly , but progressively " on the album . In 2015 , she released the song " Pretty Girls " with Iggy Azalea , however the song was met with moderate impact and Spears headed back to the studio to record more songs , but did n't have plans to release a new album . In November 2015 , Spears teased on her Instagram account that she was working with songwriters Justin Tranter and Julia Michaels , by posting a picture of them looking " bemused " with the caption : " Working hard and hardly working ... new album ... wheeeee ! . " A month later , Tranter gave an interview for website NewNowNext about his work with Spears and commented : " Working with Britney is a fucking dream . She is so sweet , so inspiring and a master on the mic . Me and Julia had to leave the studio one day because our screams of excitement after every take she did were distracting the producers . " In late 2016 , during interviews to promote the album , Spears declared that she wanted to explore new things on the record , and that it was her " most hip-hop album , " explaining : " ... there are like two or three songs that go in the direction of more urban that I 've wanted to do for a long time now , and I just have n't really done that . " In May 2016 , in an exclusive interview for website '' Breathe Heavy '' , Tranter revealed : " Nobody ever talks about Britney as a writer and she ’s f " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " was written by Mattias Larsson , Robin Fredriksson , Julia Michaels , Justin Tranter and Sandy Chila , with production being done by Mattman & Robin . Mattman & Robin were also responsible for programming , drums , percussion , snaps , handclaps , synths , guitars , bass and kalimba , while Michaels and Jermaine Jackson provided background vocals . It was recorded at 158 Studios , Westlake Village , California , The Studio at the Palms , Las Vegas , Nevada , and at Wolf Cousins Studios , Stockholm , Sweden . " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is an electropop , and dance-pop song that lasts for three minutes and twenty-two seconds ( 3:22 ) . It features " subtle keyboards , a strummed guitar , " and " wobbly bass " in its instrumentation . For Brian Josephs of '' Spin '' , the song 's guitar slaps " recall her 2001 single ' I 'm a Slave 4 U. ' " Other critics also felt that the " strummed flamenco guitar " on the song is similar to those on Justin Timberlake 's " Like I Love You " . Bianca Gracie of '' Fuse '' opined that the song reminded her of " the glory days ( no pun intended ) of ' Circus ' and ' Femme Fatale ' . " Lyrically , " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is a flirty song about Spears " offer ing several reasons why her lover should come over and options , which can be seen in the lines " Nobody should be alone if they do n't have to be " and " I could get into that kissin ' and touchin ' / Or we could be good and do next to nothin ' . " Amy Roberts of '' Bustle '' noted that the lyrics are about hooking up , adding that they " celebrate the idea that casual relationships do n't need to be lacking respect or understanding . You do n't have to be in love with , or committing to , the person that you 're hooking up with , but that also does n't mean that you ca n't connect with them on a different level than just sex . In fact , Spears makes it clear that it 's kind of even cool if her hook-up does n't want to have sex . Her partner can draw the boundaries of where the massage she 's offering starts and ends , and if it remains as nothing more than a back rub then so be it – that 's totally cool . " For Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine , the song features " some dubious lyrics that seem to suggest masturbatory self-love " in the lines : " All I want is what you want/And all you want is me . " The chorus of the song features " a shouted gang " of backup singers , singing : " Whatever you want / whatever you need / I 'll do it ! . " Lewis Corner of Digital Spy called it " a thumping pop anthem , " praising " Britney 's seductive vocal delivery . " Gil Kaufman of '' Billboard '' named it a " fun , flirty " track . Bianca Gracie of '' Fuse '' described it as a " pulsating track that is a flirty booty call that is bound to own the dance floor . " Robbie Daw of Idolator found it to be " a traditional Spears-style chunk of dance-pop " and " arguably the best yet , with its thick whomping bass and that sparkling ' nobody should be alone if they do n't have to be ' breakdown . " Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine called it " impeccably produced downstairs music , " adding that it " is an irresistible slice of dance-pop , with an ebullient bassline and staccato acoustic guitar . " Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic declared that " some of the highlights on the album are the silliest songs , " citing " Do You Wan na Come Over " 's " overheated flamenco chorus " as an example . Maura Johnston of '' Boston Globe '' said the song was one of the album 's high points , noting that the song " is jolted to life by the slashed guitars that helped make ' Toxic ' a pop thrill . " John Murphy of musicOMH was positive while noting that the track " has a rush and urgency about it which marks it out as one of the album 's best songs . " Nolan Feeney of '' Entertainment Weekly '' also picked it as a highlight , praising the " acoustic guitars and gurgling bass lines that make for one freaky pop experiment . " Alex Macpherson of '' The Guardian '' wrote that the song " takes the party back to Britney 's heyday , " praising the inclusion of the flamenco guitar . For '' Los Angeles Times '' writer Mikael Wood , the song " restore s some of the sonic invention that once defined Spears ' biggest hits . " Nick Levine , writing for '' NME '' , echoed the same thought , writing : " The lusty strut of ‘ Do You Wan na Come Over ? ’ nods to her early-noughties Neptunes-produced hits . " In his Vice column , Robert Christgau selected " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " and " Clumsy " as his favorite tracks on the album . Amy Mackelden of '' Bustle '' elaborated about the track : With a strong '90s vibe , an upbeat tempo , and a surprising rhythm , " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " utilizes the best of Spears ' talents . ... " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " embraces the current trend for songs that are musically complicated , that layer up their beats and sound effects , and feature multiple voices and infectious shouting during their choruses . Much like Hailee Steinfeld and Gwen Stefani 's latest offerings , " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is melodic , has a fast tempo , and is instantly recognizable . And most importantly , it 's fun . On August 18 , 2016 , Spears added " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " , as well as " Make Me ... " , to the setlist of her Las Vegas residency show Britney : Piece of Me . Later , on September 1 , 2016 , a performance of the song was broadcast from Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas for Today . During the performance , she used " an outfit similar to her risqué costume from 2016 's VMAs , while her backup dancers stood out in brightly-colored tank tops and shorts , " as reported by '' Entertainment Weekly '' Ruth Kinane . The song was also included in Spears 's setlist for the iHeartRadio Music Festival on September 24 , 2016 . Spears also performed it at I Heart Radio Jingle Ball , Triple Show and B26 Pepsi Jingle Bash during December 2016 . Also performed it at Apple Music Festival which was held in United Kingdom

On May 27 , 2014 Cyrus performed the song during the World Music Awards held in Monte Carlo , Monaco ; where she also won four World Music Awards . She wore a gown with a scenic theme based on flowers during the performance . It received positive reviews for its understated simplicity and strong vocal delivery . Cyrus returned to perform the song during the musical festival on June 21 , 2014 , Summertime Ball at Wembley Stadium of London , in front of 80,000 people . Cyrus has performed the song during her ongoing Bangerz Tour . A critic from the '' Nashville Scene '' praised the performance , writing , " Wrecking Ball was sung by Miley and earnestly shouted in unison by the arena , some of the audience tearing up . " Blake Hannon praised Cyrus ' vocal delivery , writing , " The crowd kept going when things slowed down for Wrecking Ball . It was the highlight of the night , and not because of anything visual . The costumed characters vanished and the screen was black , with Cyrus belting out one of the best pop power ballads in recent memory with only a smattering of lights . It 's a reminder that beneath it all , Cyrus has a voice — and a pretty big one , at that . " In September 2013 , British singer-songwriter James Arthur covered " Wrecking Ball " on Radio Hamburg in Germany . Later that month , The Gregory Brothers released a country version , which Laura Vitto from Mashable felt " trades in Miley 's pop-ballad sound for a twangier feel .

		CONTEXT=Music critics favorably reviewed " Never Catch Me " . Named Best New Track by '' Pitchfork Media '' , editor Jayson Greene praised Lamar 's performance , writing " his hyper-vaulting flow and embedded rhyme patterns within rhyme patterns " . For its year-end list of " The 100 Best Tracks of 2014 " , '' Pitchfork '' ranked the song at number 23 . Also commenting on Lamar , '' Billboard '' 's Chris Payne wrote , " There are n't many A-list rappers who could handle a beat like this , but Kendrick is clearly one of them . " '' Rolling Stone '' editor Jon Dolan gave the song three-and-a-half out of five stars , commenting " Over offhandedly lovely , warp-speed psychedelic soul-jazz , Lamar unleashes a word-mad waterfall with a worried emotional core ( " analyze my demise I say I 'm super-anxious " , he raps ) . " '' Consequence of Sound '' editor Nina Corcoran wrote : " when combined with one of Lamar ’s hottest verses to date ( before '' To Pimp a Butterfly '' ) , the song explodes . But it does n’t stop there . FlyLo shows off his talent by shifting gears post-Kendrick verse the only way you can : insane keys , double-time bass drum , and unrelenting hand claps . Eventually , it ’s all swallowed up in massive swelling synth and choral hums , fading to a beautiful , passionate outro . " Directed by Hiro Murai , the video begins at a funeral ( including attendees Flying Lotus and Thundercat in cameo roles ) . Seemingly a sad video , it turns instantly joyful when the two late children - a boy and a girl - bound out of their caskets at the front of the church and dance gleefully down the aisle . The mourners ca n't see the children as they dance right out of the church and out onto a blacktop , but a group of other kids chases after them as they hop in a hearse and drive away . The clip was featured by several publications on their year-end list of best videos , including '' Pitchfork '' , '' Spin '' , and Stereogumwith the latter listing it at number one . The video received two nominations at the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards : Best Choreography and Best Cinematography , ultimately winning the latter

On another aggregator website , Album of the Year , it holds the 4th position on a list of worst reviewed albums of 2014 . Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic gave the album 2.5 stars out of 5 saying that " Michele is not a natural pop star . This was true in 2009 when she debuted on '' Glee '' as Rachel Berry and it 's even clearer in 2014 . " Mike Ayers from '' Billboard '' gave a mostly positive review , saying , " Lyrically , '' Louder '' is rather one-sided , as she often sings about the perils of relationships , over and over , in ways that we 've all heard many times at this point . Still , it 's a solid effort that shows she has promise as a bonafide pop artist . " Sarah Rodman of '' The Boston Globe '' gave the album a mostly positive review , writing , " The Broadway veteran puts her mighty soprano through its paces on bouncy dance tracks , soaring ballads , and midtempo pop tunes where she straddles the line , mostly comfortably , between Katy Perry and Celine Dion . " Kyle Anderson of '' Entertainment Weekly '' gave the album a B - , writing , " It 's hard to be that mad at '' Louder '' , because it 's so admirably and lovingly crafted . There 's nothing wrong with Lea Michele 's debut , and that 's its biggest problem . While well curated and exquisitely executed , '' Louder '' is missing the visceral oomph that defines the gulf between superstars and the rest of the top 40 chum . " At '' USA Today '' , Jerry Shriver rated the album 2.5 stars out of four , and stated that " softer would have been a better approach . " He added that the song " Battlefield " points to a more promising direction . Kevin McFarland of '' The A.V. Club '' gave a C - rating , writing , " '' Louder '' , Michele 's debut solo album under her own name , does feature her distinctive talent as a vocalist . But the record is caught in an unfortunate stylistic limbo between fun-loving , youthful pop and the maturity of adult contemporary artists . " Jim Farber of the '' New York Daily News '' awarded the album two stars . He criticized , " Michele does n't so much sing as trumpet like an elephant eager for the charge . Her voice has more need than vulnerability , more anger than understanding . " Christopher R. Weingarten of '' Rolling Stone '' also gave a negative review , stating , " This album of insta-dated EDM-pop anthems and half-cocked bass drops probably wo n't help Michele 's cause . The songs about love 's ups and downs have a few memorable lyrics ( ' My heart 's too drunk to drive ' ) but not nearly enough . " '' Louder '' was nominated for World 's Best Album at the 2014 World Music Awards , held in Monaco on May 27 , 2014

		GOLD_MENTION=VMAs
		CONTEXT=After the commercial lackluster of her eighth studio album , '' Britney Jean '' ( 2013 ) , Spears started her Las Vegas residency show , Britney : Piece of Me , which attained commercial success . Later , in September 2014 , Spears posted a picture of herself in the studio , hinting that she was recording new music . In another interview , a month later , she revealed that she was working " very slowly , but progressively " on the album . In 2015 , she released the song " Pretty Girls " with Iggy Azalea , however the song was met with moderate impact and Spears headed back to the studio to record more songs , but did n't have plans to release a new album . In November 2015 , Spears teased on her Instagram account that she was working with songwriters Justin Tranter and Julia Michaels , by posting a picture of them looking " bemused " with the caption : " Working hard and hardly working ... new album ... wheeeee ! . " A month later , Tranter gave an interview for website NewNowNext about his work with Spears and commented : " Working with Britney is a fucking dream . She is so sweet , so inspiring and a master on the mic . Me and Julia had to leave the studio one day because our screams of excitement after every take she did were distracting the producers . " In late 2016 , during interviews to promote the album , Spears declared that she wanted to explore new things on the record , and that it was her " most hip-hop album , " explaining : " ... there are like two or three songs that go in the direction of more urban that I 've wanted to do for a long time now , and I just have n't really done that . " In May 2016 , in an exclusive interview for website '' Breathe Heavy '' , Tranter revealed : " Nobody ever talks about Britney as a writer and she ’s f " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " was written by Mattias Larsson , Robin Fredriksson , Julia Michaels , Justin Tranter and Sandy Chila , with production being done by Mattman & Robin . Mattman & Robin were also responsible for programming , drums , percussion , snaps , handclaps , synths , guitars , bass and kalimba , while Michaels and Jermaine Jackson provided background vocals . It was recorded at 158 Studios , Westlake Village , California , The Studio at the Palms , Las Vegas , Nevada , and at Wolf Cousins Studios , Stockholm , Sweden . " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is an electropop , and dance-pop song that lasts for three minutes and twenty-two seconds ( 3:22 ) . It features " subtle keyboards , a strummed guitar , " and " wobbly bass " in its instrumentation . For Brian Josephs of '' Spin '' , the song 's guitar slaps " recall her 2001 single ' I 'm a Slave 4 U. ' " Other critics also felt that the " strummed flamenco guitar " on the song is similar to those on Justin Timberlake 's " Like I Love You " . Bianca Gracie of '' Fuse '' opined that the song reminded her of " the glory days ( no pun intended ) of ' Circus ' and ' Femme Fatale ' . " Lyrically , " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is a flirty song about Spears " offer ing several reasons why her lover should come over and options , which can be seen in the lines " Nobody should be alone if they do n't have to be " and " I could get into that kissin ' and touchin ' / Or we could be good and do next to nothin ' . " Amy Roberts of '' Bustle '' noted that the lyrics are about hooking up , adding that they " celebrate the idea that casual relationships do n't need to be lacking respect or understanding . You do n't have to be in love with , or committing to , the person that you 're hooking up with , but that also does n't mean that you ca n't connect with them on a different level than just sex . In fact , Spears makes it clear that it 's kind of even cool if her hook-up does n't want to have sex . Her partner can draw the boundaries of where the massage she 's offering starts and ends , and if it remains as nothing more than a back rub then so be it – that 's totally cool . " For Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine , the song features " some dubious lyrics that seem to suggest masturbatory self-love " in the lines : " All I want is what you want/And all you want is me . " The chorus of the song features " a shouted gang " of backup singers , singing : " Whatever you want / whatever you need / I 'll do it ! . " Lewis Corner of Digital Spy called it " a thumping pop anthem , " praising " Britney 's seductive vocal delivery . " Gil Kaufman of '' Billboard '' named it a " fun , flirty " track . Bianca Gracie of '' Fuse '' described it as a " pulsating track that is a flirty booty call that is bound to own the dance floor . " Robbie Daw of Idolator found it to be " a traditional Spears-style chunk of dance-pop " and " arguably the best yet , with its thick whomping bass and that sparkling ' nobody should be alone if they do n't have to be ' breakdown . " Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine called it " impeccably produced downstairs music , " adding that it " is an irresistible slice of dance-pop , with an ebullient bassline and staccato acoustic guitar . " Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic declared that " some of the highlights on the album are the silliest songs , " citing " Do You Wan na Come Over " 's " overheated flamenco chorus " as an example . Maura Johnston of '' Boston Globe '' said the song was one of the album 's high points , noting that the song " is jolted to life by the slashed guitars that helped make ' Toxic ' a pop thrill . " John Murphy of musicOMH was positive while noting that the track " has a rush and urgency about it which marks it out as one of the album 's best songs . " Nolan Feeney of '' Entertainment Weekly '' also picked it as a highlight , praising the " acoustic guitars and gurgling bass lines that make for one freaky pop experiment . " Alex Macpherson of '' The Guardian '' wrote that the song " takes the party back to Britney 's heyday , " praising the inclusion of the flamenco guitar . For '' Los Angeles Times '' writer Mikael Wood , the song " restore s some of the sonic invention that once defined Spears ' biggest hits . " Nick Levine , writing for '' NME '' , echoed the same thought , writing : " The lusty strut of ‘ Do You Wan na Come Over ? ’ nods to her early-noughties Neptunes-produced hits . " In his Vice column , Robert Christgau selected " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " and " Clumsy " as his favorite tracks on the album . Amy Mackelden of '' Bustle '' elaborated about the track : With a strong '90s vibe , an upbeat tempo , and a surprising rhythm , " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " utilizes the best of Spears ' talents . ... " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " embraces the current trend for songs that are musically complicated , that layer up their beats and sound effects , and feature multiple voices and infectious shouting during their choruses . Much like Hailee Steinfeld and Gwen Stefani 's latest offerings , " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is melodic , has a fast tempo , and is instantly recognizable . And most importantly , it 's fun . On August 18 , 2016 , Spears added " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " , as well as " Make Me ... " , to the setlist of her Las Vegas residency show Britney : Piece of Me . Later , on September 1 , 2016 , a performance of the song was broadcast from Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas for Today . During the performance , she used " an outfit similar to her risqué costume from 2016 's VMAs , while her backup dancers stood out in brightly-colored tank tops and shorts , " as reported by '' Entertainment Weekly '' Ruth Kinane . The song was also included in Spears 's setlist for the iHeartRadio Music Festival on September 24 , 2016 . Spears also performed it at I Heart Radio Jingle Ball , Triple Show and B26 Pepsi Jingle Bash during December 2016 . Also performed it at Apple Music Festival which was held in United Kingdom

		CONTEXT=The show received a mixed reception from media publications . On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes , the show holds an approval rating of 43 % based on 30 critics , and summarized , " The 90th Academy Awards played it safe and hit no major snags -- but by clocking in at over four hours , returning host Jimmy Kimmel and company wore out their welcome long before the surprise ending . " Hank Stuever of '' The Washington Post '' marked , " In his second year , Kimmel has shown that the telecast need n't be anything but sharp and sure , with a funny host whose bits are manageable , shareable and – best of all – forgotten . We 're not making showbiz history here ; we 're just trying to get through another Oscar night . " Chief critic David Edelstein of '' Vulture '' wrote , " This was the best , most inspiring , and most sheerly likable Academy Awards telecast I 've ever seen . ... It was also – in terms of the actual awards – among the most disappointing . " '' Vanity Fair '' s , Richard Lawson wrote , " As a host , Kimmel struck a careful , appropriately measured tone ... All told , Sunday 's ceremony did an admirable job of recognizing all the turmoil surrounding it while maintaining the silly , chintzy trappings that so many of us tune into the Oscars for . " CNN 's Brian Lowry quipped , " The Oscars are a big , unwieldy beast , which invariably try to serve too many masters . Yet if the intent was ultimately to maintain a celebratory tone without ignoring either the outside world or the elephant in the room throughout this year 's awards , host Jimmy Kimmel and the show itself largely succeeded . " Others were more critical of the show . Television critic Maureen Ryan of '' Variety '' said , " All things considered , the show had a more or less low-key vibe . Normally it takes about two hours for the numbing effect to set in , but despite host Jimmy Kimmel 's best efforts , Sunday 's telecast started to feel a bit languid and low-energy far earlier . " Television critic James Poniewozik of '' The New York Times '' said , " despite the recent upheaval in Hollywood , the ceremony at large still focused mainly on celebration and glitter literally , in the case of the blinding set , which looked as if the ceremony were encased in an enormous geode . There 's also the perennial problem of bloat . The hitch , of course , is that every part of the show has its constituency . " Darren Franich of '' Entertainment Weekly '' wrote , " What fun we had at this year 's Oscars ! Long show , sure , but where to cut it ? " Writing for '' Deadline '' Greg Evans said , " Did the nearly four-hour running time contain any moments for the Oscar ages ? Probably not . " David Wiegand of the '' San Francisco Chronicle '' wrote , " Even the hope that the noise of clapping might keep the audience at home and in the theater awake , there was little of that for anything except the entrance of actors of advance age . " '' The Oregonian '' columnist Kristi Turnquist wrote , " Was it respectful ? Absolutely . Did it make for kind of a dull , earnest Oscars show ? Yeah , kind of .

As she performed , her blond hair blowing in the wind , and backed by six dancers wearing similar shimmering tuxes , Beyoncé gave new meaning to the lyrics : " Now everybody asks me why I 'm smiling out from ear to ear . " She kept her dancing to a minimum for most of the song as she held onto the microphone stand while singing " Love on Top " . Eventually making her way to the extended lip in front of the stage and throwing down , she encouraged the audience to put their hands together .

		GOLD_MENTION=VMAs
		CONTEXT=After the commercial lackluster of her eighth studio album , '' Britney Jean '' ( 2013 ) , Spears started her Las Vegas residency show , Britney : Piece of Me , which attained commercial success . Later , in September 2014 , Spears posted a picture of herself in the studio , hinting that she was recording new music . In another interview , a month later , she revealed that she was working " very slowly , but progressively " on the album . In 2015 , she released the song " Pretty Girls " with Iggy Azalea , however the song was met with moderate impact and Spears headed back to the studio to record more songs , but did n't have plans to release a new album . In November 2015 , Spears teased on her Instagram account that she was working with songwriters Justin Tranter and Julia Michaels , by posting a picture of them looking " bemused " with the caption : " Working hard and hardly working ... new album ... wheeeee ! . " A month later , Tranter gave an interview for website NewNowNext about his work with Spears and commented : " Working with Britney is a fucking dream . She is so sweet , so inspiring and a master on the mic . Me and Julia had to leave the studio one day because our screams of excitement after every take she did were distracting the producers . " In late 2016 , during interviews to promote the album , Spears declared that she wanted to explore new things on the record , and that it was her " most hip-hop album , " explaining : " ... there are like two or three songs that go in the direction of more urban that I 've wanted to do for a long time now , and I just have n't really done that . " In May 2016 , in an exclusive interview for website '' Breathe Heavy '' , Tranter revealed : " Nobody ever talks about Britney as a writer and she ’s f " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " was written by Mattias Larsson , Robin Fredriksson , Julia Michaels , Justin Tranter and Sandy Chila , with production being done by Mattman & Robin . Mattman & Robin were also responsible for programming , drums , percussion , snaps , handclaps , synths , guitars , bass and kalimba , while Michaels and Jermaine Jackson provided background vocals . It was recorded at 158 Studios , Westlake Village , California , The Studio at the Palms , Las Vegas , Nevada , and at Wolf Cousins Studios , Stockholm , Sweden . " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is an electropop , and dance-pop song that lasts for three minutes and twenty-two seconds ( 3:22 ) . It features " subtle keyboards , a strummed guitar , " and " wobbly bass " in its instrumentation . For Brian Josephs of '' Spin '' , the song 's guitar slaps " recall her 2001 single ' I 'm a Slave 4 U. ' " Other critics also felt that the " strummed flamenco guitar " on the song is similar to those on Justin Timberlake 's " Like I Love You " . Bianca Gracie of '' Fuse '' opined that the song reminded her of " the glory days ( no pun intended ) of ' Circus ' and ' Femme Fatale ' . " Lyrically , " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is a flirty song about Spears " offer ing several reasons why her lover should come over and options , which can be seen in the lines " Nobody should be alone if they do n't have to be " and " I could get into that kissin ' and touchin ' / Or we could be good and do next to nothin ' . " Amy Roberts of '' Bustle '' noted that the lyrics are about hooking up , adding that they " celebrate the idea that casual relationships do n't need to be lacking respect or understanding . You do n't have to be in love with , or committing to , the person that you 're hooking up with , but that also does n't mean that you ca n't connect with them on a different level than just sex . In fact , Spears makes it clear that it 's kind of even cool if her hook-up does n't want to have sex . Her partner can draw the boundaries of where the massage she 's offering starts and ends , and if it remains as nothing more than a back rub then so be it – that 's totally cool . " For Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine , the song features " some dubious lyrics that seem to suggest masturbatory self-love " in the lines : " All I want is what you want/And all you want is me . " The chorus of the song features " a shouted gang " of backup singers , singing : " Whatever you want / whatever you need / I 'll do it ! . " Lewis Corner of Digital Spy called it " a thumping pop anthem , " praising " Britney 's seductive vocal delivery . " Gil Kaufman of '' Billboard '' named it a " fun , flirty " track . Bianca Gracie of '' Fuse '' described it as a " pulsating track that is a flirty booty call that is bound to own the dance floor . " Robbie Daw of Idolator found it to be " a traditional Spears-style chunk of dance-pop " and " arguably the best yet , with its thick whomping bass and that sparkling ' nobody should be alone if they do n't have to be ' breakdown . " Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine called it " impeccably produced downstairs music , " adding that it " is an irresistible slice of dance-pop , with an ebullient bassline and staccato acoustic guitar . " Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic declared that " some of the highlights on the album are the silliest songs , " citing " Do You Wan na Come Over " 's " overheated flamenco chorus " as an example . Maura Johnston of '' Boston Globe '' said the song was one of the album 's high points , noting that the song " is jolted to life by the slashed guitars that helped make ' Toxic ' a pop thrill . " John Murphy of musicOMH was positive while noting that the track " has a rush and urgency about it which marks it out as one of the album 's best songs . " Nolan Feeney of '' Entertainment Weekly '' also picked it as a highlight , praising the " acoustic guitars and gurgling bass lines that make for one freaky pop experiment . " Alex Macpherson of '' The Guardian '' wrote that the song " takes the party back to Britney 's heyday , " praising the inclusion of the flamenco guitar . For '' Los Angeles Times '' writer Mikael Wood , the song " restore s some of the sonic invention that once defined Spears ' biggest hits . " Nick Levine , writing for '' NME '' , echoed the same thought , writing : " The lusty strut of ‘ Do You Wan na Come Over ? ’ nods to her early-noughties Neptunes-produced hits . " In his Vice column , Robert Christgau selected " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " and " Clumsy " as his favorite tracks on the album . Amy Mackelden of '' Bustle '' elaborated about the track : With a strong '90s vibe , an upbeat tempo , and a surprising rhythm , " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " utilizes the best of Spears ' talents . ... " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " embraces the current trend for songs that are musically complicated , that layer up their beats and sound effects , and feature multiple voices and infectious shouting during their choruses . Much like Hailee Steinfeld and Gwen Stefani 's latest offerings , " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is melodic , has a fast tempo , and is instantly recognizable . And most importantly , it 's fun . On August 18 , 2016 , Spears added " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " , as well as " Make Me ... " , to the setlist of her Las Vegas residency show Britney : Piece of Me . Later , on September 1 , 2016 , a performance of the song was broadcast from Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas for Today . During the performance , she used " an outfit similar to her risqué costume from 2016 's VMAs , while her backup dancers stood out in brightly-colored tank tops and shorts , " as reported by '' Entertainment Weekly '' Ruth Kinane . The song was also included in Spears 's setlist for the iHeartRadio Music Festival on September 24 , 2016 . Spears also performed it at I Heart Radio Jingle Ball , Triple Show and B26 Pepsi Jingle Bash during December 2016 . Also performed it at Apple Music Festival which was held in United Kingdom

		CONTEXT=The show received a mixed reception from media publications . On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes , the show holds an approval rating of 43 % based on 30 critics , and summarized , " The 90th Academy Awards played it safe and hit no major snags -- but by clocking in at over four hours , returning host Jimmy Kimmel and company wore out their welcome long before the surprise ending . " Hank Stuever of '' The Washington Post '' marked , " In his second year , Kimmel has shown that the telecast need n't be anything but sharp and sure , with a funny host whose bits are manageable , shareable and – best of all – forgotten . We 're not making showbiz history here ; we 're just trying to get through another Oscar night . " Chief critic David Edelstein of '' Vulture '' wrote , " This was the best , most inspiring , and most sheerly likable Academy Awards telecast I 've ever seen . ... It was also – in terms of the actual awards – among the most disappointing . " '' Vanity Fair '' s , Richard Lawson wrote , " As a host , Kimmel struck a careful , appropriately measured tone ... All told , Sunday 's ceremony did an admirable job of recognizing all the turmoil surrounding it while maintaining the silly , chintzy trappings that so many of us tune into the Oscars for . " CNN 's Brian Lowry quipped , " The Oscars are a big , unwieldy beast , which invariably try to serve too many masters . Yet if the intent was ultimately to maintain a celebratory tone without ignoring either the outside world or the elephant in the room throughout this year 's awards , host Jimmy Kimmel and the show itself largely succeeded . " Others were more critical of the show . Television critic Maureen Ryan of '' Variety '' said , " All things considered , the show had a more or less low-key vibe . Normally it takes about two hours for the numbing effect to set in , but despite host Jimmy Kimmel 's best efforts , Sunday 's telecast started to feel a bit languid and low-energy far earlier . " Television critic James Poniewozik of '' The New York Times '' said , " despite the recent upheaval in Hollywood , the ceremony at large still focused mainly on celebration and glitter literally , in the case of the blinding set , which looked as if the ceremony were encased in an enormous geode . There 's also the perennial problem of bloat . The hitch , of course , is that every part of the show has its constituency . " Darren Franich of '' Entertainment Weekly '' wrote , " What fun we had at this year 's Oscars ! Long show , sure , but where to cut it ? " Writing for '' Deadline '' Greg Evans said , " Did the nearly four-hour running time contain any moments for the Oscar ages ? Probably not . " David Wiegand of the '' San Francisco Chronicle '' wrote , " Even the hope that the noise of clapping might keep the audience at home and in the theater awake , there was little of that for anything except the entrance of actors of advance age . " '' The Oregonian '' columnist Kristi Turnquist wrote , " Was it respectful ? Absolutely . Did it make for kind of a dull , earnest Oscars show ? Yeah , kind of . " Attaining 26.5 million U.S. viewers according to Nielsen ratings , the ceremony 's telecast had a 16-percent drop in viewership from last year 's ceremony and had the lowest U.S. viewership in Oscar history . On March 6 , after the final ratings were confirmed , President Donald Trump took to his Twitter account , saying , " Lowest rated Oscars in HISTORY . Problem is , we do n't have stars anymore – except your President ( just kidding , of course ) ! " . In response , Kimmel also tweeted , saying , " Thanks , lowest rated President in HISTORY . " In July 2018 , the ceremony presentation received eight nominations for the 70th Primetime Creative Arts Emmys

		GOLD_MENTION=Caltavuturo massacre
		CONTEXT=Crispi was replaced as prime minister by Antonio Di Rudinì in February 1891 , who was succeeded by Giovanni Giolitti in May 1892 . On January 20 , 1893 , when peasants of Caltavuturo occupied communal land that they claimed was theirs , local authorities killed 13 and wounded 21 in the Caltavuturo massacre . Disturbances continued throughout the year . The Fasci started out as urban movements , animated by artisans , which evolved into a more popular and combative mass movement with the adherence of sulphur miners , and in a later stage with the involvement of peasants and sharecroppers . In the autumn of 1893 , labour conflicts in the cities and the mines came together with the protests and claims of the farmers . The movement reached its greatest breadth in the manifestations against taxes , involving the lowest tiers of the city and the countryside , becoming difficult , if not impossible , to control by its leaders

		ANSWER=Frankfurter
		GOLD_MENTION=Preparedness Day Bombing
		CONTEXT=In September 1917 , he was appointed counsel to a commission , the President 's Mediation Committee , established by President Wilson to resolve major strikes threatening war production . Among the disturbances he investigated were the 1916 Preparedness Day Bombing in San Francisco , where he argued strongly that the radical leader Thomas Mooney had been framed and required a new trial . He also examined the copper industry in Arizona , where industry bosses solved industrial relations problems by having more than 1,000 strikers forcibly deported to New Mexico . Overall , Frankfurter 's work gave him an opportunity to learn firsthand about labor politics and extremism , including anarchism , communism and revolutionary socialism . He came to sympathize with labor issues , arguing that " unsatisfactory , remediable social conditions , if unattended , give rise to radical movements far transcending the original impulse . " His activities led the public to view him as a radical lawyer and supporter of radical principles . Former President Theodore Roosevelt accused him of being " engaged in excusing men precisely like the Bolsheviki in Russia . " Frankfurter and Supreme Court justice Louis Brandeis secretly collaborated over many years on numerous covert political activities . The relationship began after Brandeis secured Frankfurter a position at Harvard through Jacob Schiff . Brandeis enlisted Frankfurter as his paid political lobbyist and lieutenant . In May 1917 when U.S. Secretary of State Robert Lansing received a report that the Ottomans were extremely weary of the war and that it might be possible to induce them to break with Germany and make a separate peace with Britain , Brandeis and Frankfurter worked to prevent this from occurring . Frankfurter became part of the delegation and persuaded the delegation ’s leader , former Ambassador Henry J. Morgenthau , to abandon the effort . This was described in books by Jehuda Reinharz , Peter Grose , Peter Balakian , and Charles Glass , as reported in '' Against Our Better Judgement '' , by Alison Weir

Later , released memos and other documents revealed their frustration with the inaction of both the administration of President Bill Clinton and the United Nations in response to the growing violence . Render and Bushnell expressed their " deep concern over the mounting violence in Rwanda " , as well as " the distribution of arms and arms caches . " They were also concerned with President Clinton 's prior lack of support for the Arusha Accords , and on 25 March 1994 , they met with the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front leaders who " blamed the President for the impasse .

Two weeks later , following Render and Bushnell 's return from the trip to Burundi and Rwanda the plane carrying Rwandan President Juvénal Habyarimana and Burundian President Cyprien Ntaryamira was shot down as it approached Kigali , effectively kicking off the genocide .

" On 26 April 1994 , Render and US Ambassador to Rwanda David P. Rawson met with Rwandan Ambassador to the United States Uwimana and urged him and the Rwandan government to help stop the massacres . Uwimana claimed that the massacres were acts of self-defense on behalf of the Hutus , and when asked what the United States could do to help stop the killings , he replied that they could " tell the minority Tutsis to accept their status as a minority , and tell the RPF that , although they might win the war , they can not govern the country .

		GOLD_MENTION=London bombings
		CONTEXT=In a May 2005 column in the '' Weekly Standard '' , Daveed Gartenstein-Ross wrote about his May 14 , 2005 , debate with Bray on PAX-TV 's Faith Under Fire program . He noted that a '' Chicago Tribune '' article had detailed how the fundamentalist Islamist Muslim Brotherhood operates in the US through MAS , and that MAS wants to see the US governed by sharia law . He noted that MAS , " except in its most public of statements " , was open about its agenda . He argued that while Bray " tries to portray MAS as an organization that embraces these shared liberal democratic values , the group simultaneously teaches its members that all government should become Islamic and that non-Islamic judicial systems should be boycotted . " In July 2005 , after the London bombings that killed 52 people , Bray said : " Let me say to the terrorists very clearly , that you will have no comfort in our community . Our community offers you no harbor . Our message is clear , you do no service to Islam , you do a great disservice to Islam and for the love of God , stop this madness . " When the '' Philadelphia Inquirer '' published some of the cartoons of Mohammed in the 2005 Mohammed cartoons controversy , Bray said : " This has nothing to do with free speech ; its pure sensationalism that reeks of religious disrespect . What the '' Philadelphia Inquirer '' has done is irresponsible , provocative , and reckless . " When in November 2006 , two imams from Boston-area mosques were arrested and charged with being involved in a scheme that secured religious worker visas for immigrants who instead got secular jobs , Bray said : " If this was sic clerics who were anything other than Muslims , would they have had to face this ? " After the September 2007 resignation of Esam Omeish from a Virginia Commission on Immigration , after it was revealed that he had publicly endorsed " the jihad way " in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict , Bray said " What 's the big news ? Everybody knows Muslims feel passionately about the Palestinian issue . What in the world is wrong about talking about the invasion of Lebanon or the plight of the Palestinian people ?

		GOLD_MENTION=
		CONTEXT=Zita Szeleczky ( 20 April 1915 – 12 July 1999 ) was a Hungarian stage and film actress . She was discovered by the film studios in 1938 and soon became one of the most popular screen stars , performing in about 30 films between 1938 - 1944 , mostly musical comedies . She was active in war effort and gave many patriotic recitals during the last days of the WW II , when the Soviet troops were already capturing Budapest . As Hungary was taken , she had to fake her own suicide and flee the country , where she in fact was sentenced to prison in absentia by the pro-soviet authorities . She spent years in Italy ( where she had also starred in a film ) , Argentina and USA , but her film career was sadly never revived , even though she remained popular on concert stage . As the political climate changed , she returned to Hungary in 1988 . In 1993 the Superior Court of Hungary exonerated Ms. Szeleczky , stating that the 1947 conviction was based on fabricated charges . She was awarded the Cross of the Hungarian Republic . Miss Szeleczky died in 1999 . The Hungarian Postal Service issued a stamp commemorating the 100th anniversary of this beautiful actress and singer in 2015 .

		GOLD_MENTION=purged
		CONTEXT=According to Ehrenburg , the mandatory State literary commission did not commit to publish the book in October 1944 : " Instead of a straight answer , the resolution was : ' write the book , and if it comes out well , it would be published . ' But it is not we who are the authors , it is the fascists ... What does that mean , ' comes out well ' this is not a novel , it is a document . " The book was partially printed in the Soviet Union by the Yiddish publisher '' Der Emes '' , however the entire edition , the typefaces , as well as the manuscript , were destroyed . First the censors ordered changes in the text to conceal the specifically anti-Jewish character of the atrocities and to downplay the role of some Ukrainians who worked as Nazi police officers . In 1948 the Soviet edition of the book was scrapped completely . The collection of original documents that Ehrenburg handed down to the Vilnius Jewish Museum after the war was secretly returned to him upon the Museum 's termination in 1948 . The JAC was also disbanded , its members purged at the outset of the state campaign against the " rootless cosmopolitans " , a Soviet euphemism for Jews . ( See also the Doctors ' plot ) . Typically , the official Soviet policy regarding the Holocaust was to present it as atrocities committed against Soviet citizens , without acknowledging the genocide of the Jews

In case of the Raid of the Ghetto of Rome on 16 October 1943 , when over 1,000 Jews were arrested to be deported and killed at Auschwitz , the Roman police had not participated and had not been asked to as the Germans considered them to be to unreliable . Up to the issuing of the police order , Italian police had only assisted the Germans in the arrest and persecution of Jews when requested to . From 1 December 1943 it did so on its own accord . The Fascist Italian government also established concentration camps for arrested Jews following the issuing of Police Order No. 5 , like the Fossoli camp , reopened in December 1943 , which was eventually handed over to the Germans in March 1944

		CONTEXT=In May 1943 the division transferred for garrison duties to the Greek island of Cefalonia . After Italy 's surrender to the Allies on 3 September 1943 the divisions commanding general Antonio Gandin was left without clear orders from his superiors .

		ANSWER=Kibroth Hattaavah
		GOLD_MENTION=
		CONTEXT=Kibroth Hattaavah or Kibroth - hattaavah ( , graves of craving ) is one of the locations which the Israelites passed through during their Exodus journey , recorded in the Book of Numbers . It was at this place , according to the biblical narrative , that the Israelites loudly complained about constantly eating only manna , and that they had enjoyed a much more varied diet , of fish , vegetables , fruit and meat , when they lived in Egypt ; the text states that this led Moses , in despair , to cry out to Yahweh , who then promised them so much meat that ' they would vomit it through their nostrils ' . The narrative goes on to tell of a huge number of quails brought by the winds to both sides of the Israelite encampment , which the people gathered . Modern translations imply that Yahweh sent the plague as they were chewing the first meat that fell . However , the correct word is not chewed , but rather cut off ( יִכָּרֵ֧ת ) . Thus , the quail was eaten for a month , and the plague was sent as they continued to eat the quail .

		CONTEXT=The Battle of the Rhône Crossing took place during the Second Punic War . The Carthaginian army under Hannibal Barca , while marching to Italy in the autumn of 218 BC , fought an army of the ethnically - Gaulish Volcae tribe on the east bank of the Rhone River . The pro-Roman Volcae , acting on behalf of a Roman army camped on the east bank near Massalia , intended to prevent the Carthaginians from crossing and invading Italy . Devising a plan to circumvent the Volcae , the Carthaginians , before crossing the river to attack the Gauls , had sent a detachment upriver under Hanno , son of Bomilcar , to cross at a different point and take position behind the Gauls . Hannibal led the main army across after Hanno sent smoke signals saying that the ambush was in place . As the Gauls massed to oppose Hannibal 's force , Hanno attacked them from behind and routed their army . Although the battle was not fought against a Roman army , the result of the battle had a profound effect on the war . Had the Carthaginians been prevented from crossing the Rhone , the 218 invasion of Italy might not have taken place . This is the first major battle that Hannibal fought outside the Iberian Peninsula .

		CONTEXT=At the beginning of 1999 , Wright was kept off WCW television for an extended length of time until May , when Wright came up with his own idea for a gimmick : Promotional spots began appearing on WCW television featuring Wright as a surprising new Rivethead-style character named Berlyn ( an intentional misspelling of the city Berlin , the capital of Wright 's home country Germany ) , with a black Mohawk and goatee replacing his blond hair . He was clad entirely in black with a long trench coat and arrogantly refused to speak English .

		GOLD_MENTION=Stalinist terror
		CONTEXT=The crux of Nolte 's thesis was presented when he wrote : " It is a notable shortcoming of the literature about National Socialism that it does not know or does not want to admit to what degree all the deeds — with the sole exception of the technical process of gassing — that the National Socialists later committed had already been described in a voluminous literature of the early 1920s : mass deportations and shootings , torture , death camps , extermination of entire groups using strictly objective selection criteria , and public demands for the annihilation of millions of guiltless people who were thought to be " enemies " . It is probable that many of these reports were exaggerated . It is certain that the “ White Terror ” also committed terrible deeds , even though its program contained no analogy to the “ extermination of the bourgeoisie ” . Nonetheless , the following question must seem permissible , even unavoidable : Did the National Socialists or Hitler perhaps commit an “ Asiatic ” deed merely because they and their ilk considered themselves to be the potential victims of an “ Asiatic ” deed ? Was n’t the ' Gulag Archipelago ' more original than Auschwitz ? Was the Bolshevik murder of an entire class not the logical and factual '' prius '' of the " racial murder " of National Socialism ? Can not Hitler 's most secret deeds be explained by the fact that he had '' not '' forgotten the rat cage ? Did Auschwitz in its root causes not originate in a past that would not pass ? " Nolte wrote the principle problem " for the coming generations ... must be liberation from collectivist thinking " , which Nolte claimed dominated scholarship on Nazi Germany . Nolte ended his essay with calling for a " more comprehensive debate " about the memory of Nazi Germany that would allow for " the past that will not go away " to finally go away " as is suitable for every past " . Nolte subsequently presented a 1940 book by American author Theodore N. Kaufman entitled '' Germany Must Perish ! '' . The text contends that all German men should be sterilized , evidencing , according to Nolte , the alleged " Jewish " desire to " annihilate " Germans prior to the Holocaust . An August 1941 appeal to the world by a group of Soviet Jews seeking support against Germany was also cited by Nolte as evidence of Jewish determination to thwart the '' Reich '' . Nolte argued that the Nazis felt forced to undertake the Holocaust by Hitler 's conclusion that the entire Jewish population of the world had declared war on Germany . From Nolte 's point of view , the Holocaust was an act of “ Asiatic barbarism ” forced on the Germans by the fear of what Joseph Stalin , whom Nolte believed to have significant Jewish support , might do to them . Nolte contends that the U.S. internment of Japanese Americans in the wake of the Pearl Harbor attack provides a parallel to the German " internment " of the Jewish population of Europe in concentration camps , in light of what Nolte alleges was the " Jewish " declaration of war on Germany in 1939 which Weizmann 's letter allegedly constitutes . Subsequently , Nolte expanded upon these views in his 1987 book '' Der europäische Bürgerkrieg , 1917 – 1945 '' ( '' The European Civil War , 1917 – 1945 '' ) in which he claimed that the entire 20th century was an age of genocide , totalitarianism , and tyranny , and that the Holocaust had been merely one chapter in the age of violence , terror and population displacement . Nolte claimed that this age had started with the genocide of the Armenians during World War I , and also included the Stalinist terror in the Soviet Union , the expulsion of ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe , Maoist terror in China as manifested in such events as the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution , compulsory population exchanges between Greece and Turkey from 1922 to 1923 , American war crimes in the Vietnam War , the Khmer Rouge genocide in Cambodia , and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan . In particular , Nolte argued that the expulsion of ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe in 1945 – 46 was " to be categorized ... under the concept of genocide " . As part of this argument , Nolte cited the 1979 book of the American historian Alfred-Maurice de Zayas , '' Die Wehrmacht Untersuchungsstelle '' , which argues that the Allies were just as guilty of war crimes as the Germans as the " happy evidence of the will to objectivity on the part of a foreigner " In Nolte 's opinion , Hitler was a " European citizen " who fought in defence of the values of the West against " Asiatic " Bolshevism , but due to his " total egocentrism " waged this struggle with unnecessary violence and brutality Since in Nolte 's view , the '' Shoah '' was not a unique crime , there is no reason to single out Germans for special criticism for the Holocaust . In addition , Nolte sees his work as the beginning of a much-needed revisionist treatment to end the " negative myth " of the Third Reich that dominates contemporary perceptions . Nolte took the view that the principle problem of German history was this “ negative myth ” of the Third Reich , which cast the Nazi era as the '' ne plus ultra '' of evil . Nolte wrote that after the American Civil War , the defeated South was cast as the symbol of total evil by the victorious North , but later “ revisionism ” became the dominant historical interpretation against the “ negative myth ” of the South , which led to a more balanced history of the Civil War with a greater understanding of the “ motives and way of life of the defeated Southern states ” , and led to the leaders of the Confederacy becoming great American heroes . Nolte urged that a similar “ revisionism ” destroy the “ negative myth ” of the Third Reich . Nolte argued that the Vietnam War , the Khmer Rouge genocide , the expulsion of " boat people " from Vietnam , the Islamic revolution in Iran , and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan meant the traditional picture of Nazi Germany as the ultimate in evil was no longer tenable , and proved the need for " revisionism " to put an end to the " negative myth " of the Third Reich . In Nolte 's view , the first efforts at revisionism of the Nazi period failed because A. J. P. Taylor 's 1961 book '' The Origins of the Second World War '' was only a part of the " anti-German literature of indictment " while David Hoggan in '' Der erzwugnene Krieg '' , by only seeking to examine why World War II broke out in 1939 , " cut himself off from the really decisive questions " . Then the next revisionist efforts Nolte cites were the Italian historian Domenico Settembrini 's favorable treatment of Fascism for saving Italy from Communism , and the British historian Timothy Mason 's studies in working class German history . The best of the revisionists according to Nolte is David Irving , with whom Nolte finds some fault , although " not all of Irving 's theses and points can be dismissed with such ease " . Nolte praises Irving as the first to understand that Weizmann 's letter to Chamberlain was a " Jewish declaration of war " on Germany that justified the " interning " of the Jews of Europe . Nolte went on to praise Irving for putting the Holocaust " in a more comprehensive perspective " by comparing it to the British fire-bombing of Hamburg in 1943 , which Nolte views as just much of an act of genocide as the " Final Solution " . The sort of revisionism needed to end the " negative myth " of the Third Reich is , in Nolte 's opinion , an examination of the impact of the Russian Revolution on Germany

		ANSWER=49th Battalion

		CONTEXT=The 49th Battalion was an infantry unit of the Australian Army . Raised as part of the Australian Imperial Force during the First World War , the battalion fought along the Western Front between mid-1916 and late 1918 , before being disbanded in early 1919 . In 1921 , it was re-formed as a part - time unit based in the state of Queensland . Throughout the 1930s , the battalion was merged a couple of times as a result of manpower shortages , but in early 1940 , as Australia mobilised for the Second World War , the 49th was expanded and the following year deployed to New Guinea to undertake garrison duty . Following Japan 's entry into the war , the 49th was committed to the fighting in the early stages of the New Guinea campaign , taking part in the Battle of Sanananda in December 1942 , where it took many casualties and suffered heavily from disease . The battalion was withdrawn back to Australia in early 1943 and subsequently disbanded in July , with the majority of its personnel being redistributed to other units . During the post-war period , the 49th Battalion was subsumed into the Royal Queensland Regiment , existing between 1966 and 1997 , before being merged with the 25th Battalion to form the 25th / 49th Battalion , Royal Queensland Regiment .

		GOLD_MENTION=Kennedy 's assassination
		CONTEXT=When Kennedy became president in 1961 , he appointed Rostow as deputy to his national security assistant McGeorge Bundy . Rostow annoyed Kennedy as an " idea-a-minute man " , causing him to complain that Rostow had too many ideas for his own good and was unable to focus on what was really important . Kennedy 's main complaint was that Rostow would in a rapid fire fashion offer up a deluge of ideas , which made him hard to follow . Kennedy also complained that Rostow was too fixated on Vietnam , charging he seemed to have an obsession with that country as he spent much time talking about Vietnam . As early as June 1961 , Rostow was advising Kennedy to bomb North Vietnam . During the Berlin crisis of 1961 , Rostow advised Kennedy : " We must find ways of putting pressure on Khrushchev 's side of the line with conventional forces or other means ... We must begin now to present Khrushchev with the risk that if he heightens the Berlin crisis , we and the West Germans may take action that will cause East Germany to come unstruck " . The particular action that Rostow advised Kennedy to take was to " take and hold a piece of territory in East Germany that Khrushchev may not wish to lose ( for example , Magdeburg ) " . Kennedy rejected this advice as too dangerous , stating that having U.S forces seize part of East Germany would almost certainly cause a nuclear war with the Soviet Union . Later that year , Rostow became Director of the State Department 's Policy Planning Staff . Kennedy told Rostow that his being demoted from the White House to the State Department was because : " Over here in the White House we have to play with a very narrow range of choices ... We ca n't do long-range planning ; it has to be done over there . I want you to go over there and catch hold of the process at the level where it counts " . Appealing to Kennedy 's Catholicism , Rostow complained that : " I am going from being a priest in Rome to being a bishop in the provinces . " In October 1961 , Rostow went on a fact-finding mission with General Maxwell Taylor to South Vietnam and he returned full of enthusiasm for greater American involvement in what he stated " might be the last great confrontation " with Communism . The report that Taylor and Rostow wrote advocated that Kennedy sent between 6 , 000-8,000 U.S Army troops to fight in South Vietnam under the guise of being " flood relief workers " . Kennedy rejected the Rostow-Taylor report 's recommendation that he sent troops to fight in South Vietnam , but accepted the report 's other recommendations calling for more military and economic aid to South Vietnam . . Karnow described Rostow as a man who " seemed to revel in the war " as it appeared that he wanted to prove that a short , bald , bespectacled New York intellectual could be just as hard , tough and macho as the idealized World War II veteran that Hollywood kept portraying in action films at the time . Rostow had served in World War II as an intelligence analysis with the task of selecting bombing targets in Germany , an important , but comfortable " desk job " that ensured he never saw combat , a point about which he was very sensitive about . During the Cuba Missile Crisis , Rostow was mostly excluded from the decision-making process , having only meeting with Kennedy during the crisis where he advised him to stop Soviet ships carrying oil to Cuba , advice that was not taken . Unaware that Kennedy had promised not to invade Cuba and to pull American missiles out of Turkey as part of the resolution , Rostow saw the Cuba Missile Crisis as a triumph , which proved the superior power of the United States . Inspired by the Cuba Missile crisis , Rostow on 28 November 1962 called in a memo for the bombing of North Vietnam , writing : " The whole lesson of the Cold War including the recent Cuba crisis is that Communists do not escalate in response to our actions " . In 1962 , Rostow started to advocate what became known in Washington as the " Rostow Thesis " , namely if the United States bombed North Vietnam along the same lines that Germany and Japan were bombed in World War II , then the North Vietnamese would have to cease trying to overthrow the government of South Vietnam . In 1963 , Rostow first advocated invading North Vietnam , arguing for American and South Vietnamese landings on the coast of North Vietnam as the prelude for reuniting Vietnam under the Saigon government . In a policy paper addressed to the Assistant Secretary of State for Asian Affairs , W. Averell Harriman , dated 2 February 1963 , that began with the sentence : " Before you decide your old and respectful friend has gone off his rocker ... " , Rostow advocated invading North Vietnam . As the approach of U.S. troops to the Yalu river in 1950 led to the Chinese intervention in the Korean War , it was generally accepted within Washington that invading North Vietnam would likewise lead to a war with China . For this reason , Harriman was not impressed with Rostow 's paper and advised Kennedy to sent Rostow back to his perch in academia , saying that Rostow was far too blasé about the possibility of a nuclear war with China . The Chinese nuclear program was well advanced by 1963 , and in 1964 China exploded its first atomic bomb , followed by its first hydrogen bomb in 1967 . Rostow underlined this consideration in paper addressed to Harriman in July 1963 , stating would be best to invade North Vietnam before the Chinese " blow a nuclear device " . Harriman was one of the richest men in the United States , who was very generous in donating to the Democratic Party , and as such served as a friend and adviser to every Democratic president from Roosevelt to Johnson . The persistence which Rostow advocated invading North Vietnam even after the first Chinese nuclear test in 1964 worried Harriman , and he consistently sought to club Rostow 's influence , making him into one of Rostow 's main enemies in Washington . After Kennedy 's assassination , his successor Lyndon B. Johnson promoted Rostow to Bundy 's job after he wrote Johnson 's first State of the Union speech . In 1964 , Rostow championed the idea of Congress giving President Johnson the power to wage war in Southeast Asia , an idea that he first suggested in February 1964 . Rostow pointed out in a memo to the president that the degree of escalation in the Vietnam war envisioned by the administration would pose constitutional and legal problems as the constitution gave Congress , not the president , the right to declare war and the level of escalation envisioned would be a war in everything , but name . Rostow ' solution to this problem was for Congress to pass a resolution giving the president the legal power to essentially wage a war in Vietnam

		GOLD_MENTION=last year 's ceremony
		CONTEXT=The show received a mixed reception from media publications . On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes , the show holds an approval rating of 43 % based on 30 critics , and summarized , " The 90th Academy Awards played it safe and hit no major snags -- but by clocking in at over four hours , returning host Jimmy Kimmel and company wore out their welcome long before the surprise ending . " Hank Stuever of '' The Washington Post '' marked , " In his second year , Kimmel has shown that the telecast need n't be anything but sharp and sure , with a funny host whose bits are manageable , shareable and – best of all – forgotten . We 're not making showbiz history here ; we 're just trying to get through another Oscar night . " Chief critic David Edelstein of '' Vulture '' wrote , " This was the best , most inspiring , and most sheerly likable Academy Awards telecast I 've ever seen . ... It was also – in terms of the actual awards – among the most disappointing . " '' Vanity Fair '' s , Richard Lawson wrote , " As a host , Kimmel struck a careful , appropriately measured tone ... All told , Sunday 's ceremony did an admirable job of recognizing all the turmoil surrounding it while maintaining the silly , chintzy trappings that so many of us tune into the Oscars for . " CNN 's Brian Lowry quipped , " The Oscars are a big , unwieldy beast , which invariably try to serve too many masters . Yet if the intent was ultimately to maintain a celebratory tone without ignoring either the outside world or the elephant in the room throughout this year 's awards , host Jimmy Kimmel and the show itself largely succeeded . " Others were more critical of the show . Television critic Maureen Ryan of '' Variety '' said , " All things considered , the show had a more or less low-key vibe . Normally it takes about two hours for the numbing effect to set in , but despite host Jimmy Kimmel 's best efforts , Sunday 's telecast started to feel a bit languid and low-energy far earlier . " Television critic James Poniewozik of '' The New York Times '' said , " despite the recent upheaval in Hollywood , the ceremony at large still focused mainly on celebration and glitter literally , in the case of the blinding set , which looked as if the ceremony were encased in an enormous geode . There 's also the perennial problem of bloat . The hitch , of course , is that every part of the show has its constituency . " Darren Franich of '' Entertainment Weekly '' wrote , " What fun we had at this year 's Oscars ! Long show , sure , but where to cut it ? " Writing for '' Deadline '' Greg Evans said , " Did the nearly four-hour running time contain any moments for the Oscar ages ? Probably not . " David Wiegand of the '' San Francisco Chronicle '' wrote , " Even the hope that the noise of clapping might keep the audience at home and in the theater awake , there was little of that for anything except the entrance of actors of advance age . " '' The Oregonian '' columnist Kristi Turnquist wrote , " Was it respectful ? Absolutely . Did it make for kind of a dull , earnest Oscars show ? Yeah , kind of . " Attaining 26.5 million U.S. viewers according to Nielsen ratings , the ceremony 's telecast had a 16-percent drop in viewership from last year 's ceremony and had the lowest U.S. viewership in Oscar history . On March 6 , after the final ratings were confirmed , President Donald Trump took to his Twitter account , saying , " Lowest rated Oscars in HISTORY . Problem is , we do n't have stars anymore – except your President ( just kidding , of course ) ! " . In response , Kimmel also tweeted , saying , " Thanks , lowest rated President in HISTORY . " In July 2018 , the ceremony presentation received eight nominations for the 70th Primetime Creative Arts Emmys

		CONTEXT='' The Amazing Race '' won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Reality-Competition Program for the first seven years after the creation of the award in 2003 , and ten of the twelve years since its creation , against other , more popular reality TV shows such as '' Survivor '' , '' Dancing with the Stars '' , and '' American Idol '' . Its streak was ended in 2010 when '' Top Chef '' won the Emmy for this category . Host Phil Keoghan revealed in an interview that the show 's loss that year made him and the producers realize that they will have to try harder to win the Emmy again . In 2011 , the show won in the category again for the eighth time . After its seventh consecutive win , some in the media , including '' Survivor '' host Jeff Probst suggested that '' The Amazing Race '' willingly drop out from the competition in future years , similar to Candice Bergen declining any further nominations after her fifth Emmy win for her role in '' Murphy Brown '' . Van Munster has stated that it is " not likely " he will pull the show from future Emmy awards , considering that it reflects on his and his crew 's hard work and high standards . The show has also been nominated and won several times for technical production ( Creative Arts ) Emmy awards , for Cinematography and Picture Editing for Non-Fiction programs , whereas it has only been nominated for Sound Mixing and Sound Editing for Non-Fiction programs . The show has been nominated in the same five categories for three years consecutively , a trend which continued with the 2007 Primetime Emmy Awards

		GOLD_MENTION=Video Music Awards
		CONTEXT=The ceremony was held on a night other than Sunday for the first time since 1976 ( the 28th Primetime Emmy Awards were also staged on a Monday that year , May 17 ) . The ceremony 's unusual date — a Monday night in late August — was due to two factors , primary being NBC 's commitment to '' Sunday Night Football '' ; since acquiring the National Football League 's Sunday night game package in 2006 , NBC , when it is their turn in the four-network rotation to air the Primetime Emmy Awards , usually schedules the ceremony for the Sunday before Labor Day weekend , to avoid conflicts with '' SNF '' in mid-September ( when ABC , CBS , or Fox normally air the ceremony ) . NBC 's ideal date on the 2014 calendar for the ceremony ( Sunday , August 24 ) led to the other scheduling factor — MTV 's Video Music Awards , which were set for that night more than a year in advance ( and would be staged in the L.A. area as well , at The Forum in Inglewood ) . On January 28 , 2014 , rather than go head-to-head with the VMA 's , NBC announced that the ceremony would take place on Monday , August 25 . The move would allow NBC to commit to a preseason '' Sunday Night Football '' broadcast for the 24th ( a game between the Cincinnati Bengals and Arizona Cardinals ) ; it also ensured the tradition of staging the Primetime Emmy Awards the weekend after the Creative Arts Emmy Awards ( that ceremony was already set for August 16 )

		CONTEXT=Former television columnist for '' The Star-Ledger '' Alan Sepinwall expressed his boredom on the focus given on Grey 's relationships storylines while reviewing the second season 's finale : " On those occasions when Meredith 's not involved in a plot about her love life , I do kind of like her , but those moments are so infrequent compared to her constant angsting over McDreamy -- not to mention all those seemingly unrelated storylines that always turn into a metaphor for that relationship -- that I really , really ca n't stand her . " During the show 's third season , the development of the character received negative reviews , with Cristopher Monfette of '' IGN '' stating that her storyline has become " some bizarrely under-developed sub-plot about depression and giving Derek a season 's worth of reconsidering to do . " Also during the third season , Robert Rorke of the '' New York Post '' noted the decline in Meredith 's role in the show , expressing disappointment : " She used to be the queen of the romantic dilemmas , but lately , she 's been a little dopey , what with the endless McDreamy soliloquies . " Similarly , Macleans.ca found their storyline in the fourth season overused , " This whole ' Oh I need more time , ' but ' Oh , I 'm jealous if you look at someone else ' angst was tired in the second season , frustrating in the third and now a total channel changer . The will-they-or-won ' t-they plot does n't work because they 've already been in and out of that relationship too many times . Meredith is a nag and McDreamy is henpecked . " On a more positive note , her relationship with Shepherd was included in AOL TV 's list of the " Best TV Couples of All Time " and in the same list by '' TV Guide '' . During the sixth season the development of the character was praised , Glenn Diaz of '' BuddyTV '' commented that " You got ta love Mer when she 's gloomy . " , in addition to praising Pompeo 's performance . In her review of the episode Tainted Obligation she wrote " I felt for Meredith , but after Lexie 's heartfelt begging and pleading , I was happy that Mere finally grows up and casts her selfishness aside . Three seasons ago Meredith would never have dreamed of putting Lexie first , and I was proud of her for giving up part of her liver — her offer to get to know her dad was an even bigger milestone . " Reviewing the first part of the eighth season , TV Fanatic lauded the character and wrote : " this season belongs to Meredith Grey . She is the '' heart and soul of the show '' and has been outstanding . This is a character that used to be so dark and twisty and has now grown into a more mature woman . Ellen Pompeo has been at the top of her game this season . " '' Wit & Fancy '' praised the transformation of the character and stated , " Of course Meredith will still make rash decisions like when she took off with Zola or tampered with the trial , but she does things out of love and the kindness of her heart now and not because she is dark and twisty . Considering where Meredith was at the beginning and where she is now , I think she went through a remarkable journey and did more than just growing up , she finally became ' all whole and healed ' . " Maura O'Malley of '' Bustle '' also lauded the development of the character ahead of season 12 saying , " When the series began , Meredith was just a girl sitting in a bar celebrating the exciting next phase of her life . She had graduated medical school , she was starting her residency at a prestigious hospital , and she was simply looking for a no-strings attached , one night stand . What she got instead was a complicated romantic relationship that rivals Romeo and Juliet — but the key is , she was n't searching for love . Working and learning were — and continue to be — her priorities , while McDreamy was simply an added perk . Hopefully , the new season of Grey 's Anatomy will reflect this change in tone , because Meredith is a strong , independent woman — and she will be just fine . " Later in the series , Ellen Pompeo received critical acclaim with numerous critics lauding her portrayal of the character . Reviewing the episode She 's Leaving Home '' CarterMatt '' called her the " anchor " for Grey 's saying , " Throughout , this was an episode completely anchored by Ellen Pompeo , who has done some of her best work ever on the show the past couple of weeks . Tonight , she cried , she fought , and she learned that she was carrying his child . " and added that Pompeo is often " ovelooked " saying , " Her subtlety is probably why she is often overlooked . " Rick Porter of '' Zap2it '' reviewing " How to Save a Life " wrote , " Without Meredith , and without one of Pompeo 's strongest performances in her long time on the show , " How to Save a Life " would have run the risk of coming across as a baldly manipulative death episode , the likes of which the show has done several times before . He added . " How to Save a Life " may not be the ideal Emmy-submission episode for Pompeo , considering Meredith is off screen for more than half of it . But it 's among the best work she 's ever done on the show . " '' USA Today '' also lauded Pompeo saying , " In some ways , the episode ( How to Save a Life ) was even more of a showcase for Pompeo . She had some of the more memorable and well-played scenes , from her angry response to the doctor who tries to tell her what her choices are , to her resignation when she realizes she has to comfort and motivate the young doctor whose mistakes cost Derek his life . " The relation between Meredith and Cristina has been acclaimed and been a highlight of the show . Mark Perigard of the Boston Herald considered the friendship to be " the secret core of Grey 's " . Aisha Harris of '' Slate '' called their relation '' The Best Female Friendship on TV '' adding that " With those two characters , showrunner Shonda Rhimes and her team of writers created one of the most nuanced and realistic portrayals of female friendship on television . " Samantha Highfill of '' Entertainment Weekly '' called Cristina and Meredith the best female friends on TV because " they do n't try to be " . There 's nothing fake about them , which is a rarity in how female friends are portrayed on television . She further went on to call them ' soulmates ' , " And even though they 'd never dare get sappy enough to say it , they 're soul mates . Margaret Lyons of Vulture ( magazine ) called the friendship " dream BFF relationship . " and the primary focus of the show , " One of the series ' calling cards has been its depiction of female friendship and particularly the primacy that friendship enjoyed over romantic relationships . " '' E! '' at the time of Sandra Oh 's exit wrote , " In Grey 's Anatomy 's 10-year history , the doctor duo has been through a lot together : weddings , deaths , plane crashes , bomb threats , shooting , you name it , they 've lived ( and danced ) through it . " and added , " And with the three words , ' Y '' ou 're my person . '' ' Cristina Yang and Meredith Grey solidified their status as the small screen 's best best friends ever . " Marama Whyte of '' Hypable '' wrote , " Critically , the key relationship in Meredith 's life was not her romance with Derek Shepherd , but her passionate , indestructible , absolutely enviable friendship with Cristina . Talk about relationship goals ; who wants McDreamy when Cristina Yang could be your person . These two were the real powerhouse , and Shonda Rhimes did n't shy away from making the audience remember this . Derek was the love of her life , but Cristina was her soul mate . More than anyone else , Cristina challenged Meredith , was honest with her and inspired her . For these reasons , it was Cristina who was constantly the source of Meredith 's character development , not Derek . " Pompeo 's character has also been used to define the image a strong woman , '' Bustle '' previewing the 12th season wrote , " Meredith Grey has always been capable of being on her own . Grey 's Anatomy is about Meredith 's journey . Men and romantic interests are a part of her life , but they are not the priority . She does n't need McDreamy . Grey 's Anatomy does n't need McDreamy . So even if the writers do decide to create a new love interest for Ms. Grey ( Martin Henderson , perhaps ? ) , it would n't matter . I have faith that the show 's writers will do this storyline justice , because TV needs more strong single women — and Meredith seems like the perfect candidate . " The site added , " This past season was almost a trial run for a McDreamy-less Grey 's Anatomy . When Derek left for Washington D.C. to pursue his research , Meredith stayed behind and focused on her own career . She did n't chase him . Her priority were her children and the Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital . Meredith showed that she would never put aside her own dreams and aspirations for a man , and I believe that this wo n't change after Derek 's death . " Pompeo has won and has been nominated for multiple awards for her portrayal of Grey . She and the '' Grey 's Anatomy '' cast won Best Ensemble in a Television Series at the 2006 Satellite Awards . During the following year 's ceremony , she was named Best Actress in a Television Drama Series . She was among the '' Grey 's Anatomy '' cast members awarded the Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series accolade at the 13th Screen Actors Guild Awards , and received nominations in the same category in 2006 and 2008 . Pompeo received a Best Performance by an Actress in a Drama Series nomination at the 64th Golden Globe Awards – the program won Best Drama Series at the same ceremony . Also in 2007 , Pompeo and the female cast and crew of '' Grey 's Anatomy '' received the Women in Film Lucy Award , which honors those " whose work in television has positively influenced attitudes toward women . " Pompeo 's performance has garnered her multiple People 's Choice Awards . At the 37th People 's Choice Awards , she was nominated against Dempsey and Oh in the Favorite TV Doctor category , and the following year , she was a contender in the Favorite TV Drama Actress category . Since 2012 , Pompeo has received a nomination at the People 's Choice Awards every year in two categories at 40th People 's Choice Awards alongside Patrick Dempsey and Sandra Oh respectively . She won the Best Drama Actress Award at both the 39th People 's Choice Awards and the 41st People 's Choice Awards . In 2007 , show-business awards reporter Tom O'Neil commented that Pompeo was overdue an Emmy Award nomination for her role in '' Grey 's Anatomy '' . Readers of O'Neil 's awards website , '' The Envelope '' , included Pompeo in their 2009 nominations for Best Drama Actress in the site 's Gold Derby TV Awards . '' Entertainment Weekly '' launched the EWwy Awards in 2008 , to honor actors who have not received Emmy nominations . Pompeo was nominated in the Best Actress in a Drama Series category , and placed fourth , with 19 percent of readers ' votes

		GOLD_MENTION=64th Golden Globe Awards
		CONTEXT=Former television columnist for '' The Star-Ledger '' Alan Sepinwall expressed his boredom on the focus given on Grey 's relationships storylines while reviewing the second season 's finale : " On those occasions when Meredith 's not involved in a plot about her love life , I do kind of like her , but those moments are so infrequent compared to her constant angsting over McDreamy -- not to mention all those seemingly unrelated storylines that always turn into a metaphor for that relationship -- that I really , really ca n't stand her . " During the show 's third season , the development of the character received negative reviews , with Cristopher Monfette of '' IGN '' stating that her storyline has become " some bizarrely under-developed sub-plot about depression and giving Derek a season 's worth of reconsidering to do . " Also during the third season , Robert Rorke of the '' New York Post '' noted the decline in Meredith 's role in the show , expressing disappointment : " She used to be the queen of the romantic dilemmas , but lately , she 's been a little dopey , what with the endless McDreamy soliloquies . " Similarly , Macleans.ca found their storyline in the fourth season overused , " This whole ' Oh I need more time , ' but ' Oh , I 'm jealous if you look at someone else ' angst was tired in the second season , frustrating in the third and now a total channel changer . The will-they-or-won ' t-they plot does n't work because they 've already been in and out of that relationship too many times . Meredith is a nag and McDreamy is henpecked . " On a more positive note , her relationship with Shepherd was included in AOL TV 's list of the " Best TV Couples of All Time " and in the same list by '' TV Guide '' . During the sixth season the development of the character was praised , Glenn Diaz of '' BuddyTV '' commented that " You got ta love Mer when she 's gloomy . " , in addition to praising Pompeo 's performance . In her review of the episode Tainted Obligation she wrote " I felt for Meredith , but after Lexie 's heartfelt begging and pleading , I was happy that Mere finally grows up and casts her selfishness aside . Three seasons ago Meredith would never have dreamed of putting Lexie first , and I was proud of her for giving up part of her liver — her offer to get to know her dad was an even bigger milestone . " Reviewing the first part of the eighth season , TV Fanatic lauded the character and wrote : " this season belongs to Meredith Grey . She is the '' heart and soul of the show '' and has been outstanding . This is a character that used to be so dark and twisty and has now grown into a more mature woman . Ellen Pompeo has been at the top of her game this season . " '' Wit & Fancy '' praised the transformation of the character and stated , " Of course Meredith will still make rash decisions like when she took off with Zola or tampered with the trial , but she does things out of love and the kindness of her heart now and not because she is dark and twisty . Considering where Meredith was at the beginning and where she is now , I think she went through a remarkable journey and did more than just growing up , she finally became ' all whole and healed ' . " Maura O'Malley of '' Bustle '' also lauded the development of the character ahead of season 12 saying , " When the series began , Meredith was just a girl sitting in a bar celebrating the exciting next phase of her life . She had graduated medical school , she was starting her residency at a prestigious hospital , and she was simply looking for a no-strings attached , one night stand . What she got instead was a complicated romantic relationship that rivals Romeo and Juliet — but the key is , she was n't searching for love . Working and learning were — and continue to be — her priorities , while McDreamy was simply an added perk . Hopefully , the new season of Grey 's Anatomy will reflect this change in tone , because Meredith is a strong , independent woman — and she will be just fine . " Later in the series , Ellen Pompeo received critical acclaim with numerous critics lauding her portrayal of the character . Reviewing the episode She 's Leaving Home '' CarterMatt '' called her the " anchor " for Grey 's saying , " Throughout , this was an episode completely anchored by Ellen Pompeo , who has done some of her best work ever on the show the past couple of weeks . Tonight , she cried , she fought , and she learned that she was carrying his child . " and added that Pompeo is often " ovelooked " saying , " Her subtlety is probably why she is often overlooked .

		GOLD_MENTION=1992 Eurovision Song Contest
		CONTEXT=Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny appears at his back door in his boxers and invites viewers for a look around his house ; including a ( now fully dressed ) encounter with his karaoke machine . He then sets off on his bicycle for an interview at RTÉ . Alas his attempts to get there unscathed come undone when his bike receives a puncture and he has to resort to queueing for a bus like the common person . When the bus arrives , he realises he has no money but after asking for some spare cash from an innocent bystander , he turns around to find the bus has pulled off again . In the RTÉ carpark , Pat Kenny sits in his car , casting his eyes over his fellow broadcasters and enviously longing to join them in their casual conversation . When he finally plucks up the courage to approach Marian Finucane and Joe Duffy , the latter is overheard insulting him and Pat heads back to his car . With Pat due on air in ten minutes , Tom decides to join him in the passenger seat but he must first overcome the clutches of George Hook , who once again attempts to lure him to Newstalk . Pat asks Tom what the world really thinks of him , believing that his assistant is the only person in the world who is loyal to him . Tom attempts to avoid the question , distracting Pat by ( wrongly ) telling him that Enda Kenny has just arrived . Eventually Tom opts to tell Pat , albeit with much hesitation , that he is '' " absolutely unbelievable " '' . At that moment Enda Kenny finally arrives at the studio , still in his biker gear and collapses with exhaustion on the steps having raced through Dublin to make the interview on schedule . Kenny and Kenny square off on air and , with Pat faced with an adversary so similar in perceived personality , popularity and name he is even more unable to cope with his feelings of unworthiness than usual . Pat breaks down live on air , mistaking Enda 's rival , Taoiseach Bertie Ahern , for his own rival , '' Liveline '' presenter Joe Duffy . This prompts Enda to join him in his moment of unrelenting emotion . The next morning Tom arrives at Pat 's house . Pat assumes he has come with his P45 or details of who is to take over the mantle of the station 's highest earning broadcaster . However Tom merely points to two giant sacks of complimentary mail he has carried on his bike from RTÉ headquarters . One of them even wants to sleep with the presenter , who quickly places the letter in the left front pocket of his dressing gown . Pat is astounded to discover he is all over the news and that celebrities such as 1992 Eurovision Song Contest winner Linda Martin , music mogul Louis Walsh and Boyzone lead singer Ronan Keating are talking about him . He hurries indoors to switch on his television . There he finds that figures from the worlds of sport and politics including Irish national football team manager Steve Staunton , Ireland rugby manager Eddie O'Sullivan and Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams are lining up in their droves to pay tribute to him . He is intrigued to find Fintan O'Toole has also spoken greatly of him but becomes irritated when he finds that Steve Staunton seems to have taken over the airwaves , typically reiterating how Pat has done a great job , how he works for the team , has delivered a great result and what else can you say . Meanwhile , Bertie Ahern repeatedly rings Tom 's mobile to request an interview with Pat , but on each occasion Tom tells him to ring back later . Pat and Tom stroll into RTÉ , where George Hook is astounded to hear of Pat 's newfound popularity . He is adamant that Tom will soon join him at Newstalk but Tom shows his unswaying loyalty by declaring he will go only where Pat goes . On Friday night George slips into RTÉ and just as an episode of '' The Late Late Show '' is coming to a close , approaches Pat 's dressing room . George is inadvertently knocked to the floor by a stray microphone where he lies moaning until Pat emerges from the dressing room . Pat steps over George and leaves RTÉ with Tom , telling his assistant that he should not allow anyone to undermine him before demanding that he open the door

These led to a regular role in the Cartoon Network TV series '' Out of Jimmy 's Head '' in 2007 – 2008 and a recurring role on '' Two and a Half Men '' in 2008 – 2009 . Although she was uncredited in the poorly received '' Masked and Anonymous '' , Roger Ebert observed at the film 's 2003 Sundance Film Festival premiere " the one performer in the movie whose performance actually was applauded ; that was a young black girl named Tinashe Kachingwe , who sings ' The Times They Are A-Changin '' with such sweetness and conviction that she is like a master class . " He concluded his review of the movie : " If I had been asked to serve as consultant on this picture , my advice would have amounted to three words : more Tinashe Kachingwe . " In 2007 , Tinashe joined girl group the Stunners , founded by Vitamin C . Her bandmates were friends Marisol Esparza , Allie Gonino , Hayley Kiyoko , and Kelsey Sanders .

		CONTEXT=Former television columnist for '' The Star-Ledger '' Alan Sepinwall expressed his boredom on the focus given on Grey 's relationships storylines while reviewing the second season 's finale : " On those occasions when Meredith 's not involved in a plot about her love life , I do kind of like her , but those moments are so infrequent compared to her constant angsting over McDreamy -- not to mention all those seemingly unrelated storylines that always turn into a metaphor for that relationship -- that I really , really ca n't stand her . " During the show 's third season , the development of the character received negative reviews , with Cristopher Monfette of '' IGN '' stating that her storyline has become " some bizarrely under-developed sub-plot about depression and giving Derek a season 's worth of reconsidering to do . " Also during the third season , Robert Rorke of the '' New York Post '' noted the decline in Meredith 's role in the show , expressing disappointment : " She used to be the queen of the romantic dilemmas , but lately , she 's been a little dopey , what with the endless McDreamy soliloquies . " Similarly , Macleans.ca found their storyline in the fourth season overused , " This whole ' Oh I need more time , ' but ' Oh , I 'm jealous if you look at someone else ' angst was tired in the second season , frustrating in the third and now a total channel changer . The will-they-or-won ' t-they plot does n't work because they 've already been in and out of that relationship too many times . Meredith is a nag and McDreamy is henpecked . " On a more positive note , her relationship with Shepherd was included in AOL TV 's list of the " Best TV Couples of All Time " and in the same list by '' TV Guide '' . During the sixth season the development of the character was praised , Glenn Diaz of '' BuddyTV '' commented that " You got ta love Mer when she 's gloomy . " , in addition to praising Pompeo 's performance . In her review of the episode Tainted Obligation she wrote " I felt for Meredith , but after Lexie 's heartfelt begging and pleading , I was happy that Mere finally grows up and casts her selfishness aside . Three seasons ago Meredith would never have dreamed of putting Lexie first , and I was proud of her for giving up part of her liver — her offer to get to know her dad was an even bigger milestone . " Reviewing the first part of the eighth season , TV Fanatic lauded the character and wrote : " this season belongs to Meredith Grey . She is the '' heart and soul of the show '' and has been outstanding . This is a character that used to be so dark and twisty and has now grown into a more mature woman . Ellen Pompeo has been at the top of her game this season . " '' Wit & Fancy '' praised the transformation of the character and stated , " Of course Meredith will still make rash decisions like when she took off with Zola or tampered with the trial , but she does things out of love and the kindness of her heart now and not because she is dark and twisty . Considering where Meredith was at the beginning and where she is now , I think she went through a remarkable journey and did more than just growing up , she finally became ' all whole and healed ' . " Maura O'Malley of '' Bustle '' also lauded the development of the character ahead of season 12 saying , " When the series began , Meredith was just a girl sitting in a bar celebrating the exciting next phase of her life . She had graduated medical school , she was starting her residency at a prestigious hospital , and she was simply looking for a no-strings attached , one night stand . What she got instead was a complicated romantic relationship that rivals Romeo and Juliet — but the key is , she was n't searching for love . Working and learning were — and continue to be — her priorities , while McDreamy was simply an added perk . Hopefully , the new season of Grey 's Anatomy will reflect this change in tone , because Meredith is a strong , independent woman — and she will be just fine . " Later in the series , Ellen Pompeo received critical acclaim with numerous critics lauding her portrayal of the character . Reviewing the episode She 's Leaving Home '' CarterMatt '' called her the " anchor " for Grey 's saying , " Throughout , this was an episode completely anchored by Ellen Pompeo , who has done some of her best work ever on the show the past couple of weeks . Tonight , she cried , she fought , and she learned that she was carrying his child . " and added that Pompeo is often " ovelooked " saying , " Her subtlety is probably why she is often overlooked . " Rick Porter of '' Zap2it '' reviewing " How to Save a Life " wrote , " Without Meredith , and without one of Pompeo 's strongest performances in her long time on the show , " How to Save a Life " would have run the risk of coming across as a baldly manipulative death episode , the likes of which the show has done several times before . He added . " How to Save a Life " may not be the ideal Emmy-submission episode for Pompeo , considering Meredith is off screen for more than half of it . But it 's among the best work she 's ever done on the show . " '' USA Today '' also lauded Pompeo saying , " In some ways , the episode ( How to Save a Life ) was even more of a showcase for Pompeo . She had some of the more memorable and well-played scenes , from her angry response to the doctor who tries to tell her what her choices are , to her resignation when she realizes she has to comfort and motivate the young doctor whose mistakes cost Derek his life . " The relation between Meredith and Cristina has been acclaimed and been a highlight of the show . Mark Perigard of the Boston Herald considered the friendship to be " the secret core of Grey 's " . Aisha Harris of '' Slate '' called their relation '' The Best Female Friendship on TV '' adding that " With those two characters , showrunner Shonda Rhimes and her team of writers created one of the most nuanced and realistic portrayals of female friendship on television . " Samantha Highfill of '' Entertainment Weekly '' called Cristina and Meredith the best female friends on TV because " they do n't try to be " . There 's nothing fake about them , which is a rarity in how female friends are portrayed on television . She further went on to call them ' soulmates ' , " And even though they 'd never dare get sappy enough to say it , they 're soul mates . Margaret Lyons of Vulture ( magazine ) called the friendship " dream BFF relationship . " and the primary focus of the show , " One of the series ' calling cards has been its depiction of female friendship and particularly the primacy that friendship enjoyed over romantic relationships . " '' E! '' at the time of Sandra Oh 's exit wrote , " In Grey 's Anatomy 's 10-year history , the doctor duo has been through a lot together : weddings , deaths , plane crashes , bomb threats , shooting , you name it , they 've lived ( and danced ) through it . " and added , " And with the three words , ' Y '' ou 're my person . '' ' Cristina Yang and Meredith Grey solidified their status as the small screen 's best best friends ever . " Marama Whyte of '' Hypable '' wrote , " Critically , the key relationship in Meredith 's life was not her romance with Derek Shepherd , but her passionate , indestructible , absolutely enviable friendship with Cristina . Talk about relationship goals ; who wants McDreamy when Cristina Yang could be your person . These two were the real powerhouse , and Shonda Rhimes did n't shy away from making the audience remember this . Derek was the love of her life , but Cristina was her soul mate . More than anyone else , Cristina challenged Meredith , was honest with her and inspired her . For these reasons , it was Cristina who was constantly the source of Meredith 's character development , not Derek . " Pompeo 's character has also been used to define the image a strong woman , '' Bustle '' previewing the 12th season wrote , " Meredith Grey has always been capable of being on her own . Grey 's Anatomy is about Meredith 's journey . Men and romantic interests are a part of her life , but they are not the priority . She does n't need McDreamy . Grey 's Anatomy does n't need McDreamy . So even if the writers do decide to create a new love interest for Ms. Grey ( Martin Henderson , perhaps ? ) , it would n't matter . I have faith that the show 's writers will do this storyline justice , because TV needs more strong single women — and Meredith seems like the perfect candidate . " The site added , " This past season was almost a trial run for a McDreamy-less Grey 's Anatomy . When Derek left for Washington D.C. to pursue his research , Meredith stayed behind and focused on her own career . She did n't chase him . Her priority were her children and the Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital . Meredith showed that she would never put aside her own dreams and aspirations for a man , and I believe that this wo n't change after Derek 's death . " Pompeo has won and has been nominated for multiple awards for her portrayal of Grey . She and the '' Grey 's Anatomy '' cast won Best Ensemble in a Television Series at the 2006 Satellite Awards . During the following year 's ceremony , she was named Best Actress in a Television Drama Series . She was among the '' Grey 's Anatomy '' cast members awarded the Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series accolade at the 13th Screen Actors Guild Awards , and received nominations in the same category in 2006 and 2008 . Pompeo received a Best Performance by an Actress in a Drama Series nomination at the 64th Golden Globe Awards – the program won Best Drama Series at the same ceremony . Also in 2007 , Pompeo and the female cast and crew of '' Grey 's Anatomy '' received the Women in Film Lucy Award , which honors those " whose work in television has positively influenced attitudes toward women . " Pompeo 's performance has garnered her multiple People 's Choice Awards . At the 37th People 's Choice Awards , she was nominated against Dempsey and Oh in the Favorite TV Doctor category , and the following year , she was a contender in the Favorite TV Drama Actress category . Since 2012 , Pompeo has received a nomination at the People 's Choice Awards every year in two categories at 40th People 's Choice Awards alongside Patrick Dempsey and Sandra Oh respectively . She won the Best Drama Actress Award at both the 39th People 's Choice Awards and the 41st People 's Choice Awards . In 2007 , show-business awards reporter Tom O'Neil commented that Pompeo was overdue an Emmy Award nomination for her role in '' Grey 's Anatomy '' . Readers of O'Neil 's awards website , '' The Envelope '' , included Pompeo in their 2009 nominations for Best Drama Actress in the site 's Gold Derby TV Awards .

The ceremony 's unusual date — a Monday night in late August — was due to two factors , primary being NBC 's commitment to '' Sunday Night Football '' ; since acquiring the National Football League 's Sunday night game package in 2006 , NBC , when it is their turn in the four-network rotation to air the Primetime Emmy Awards , usually schedules the ceremony for the Sunday before Labor Day weekend , to avoid conflicts with '' SNF '' in mid-September ( when ABC , CBS , or Fox normally air the ceremony ) . NBC 's ideal date on the 2014 calendar for the ceremony ( Sunday , August 24 ) led to the other scheduling factor — MTV 's Video Music Awards , which were set for that night more than a year in advance ( and would be staged in the L.A. area as well , at The Forum in Inglewood ) . On January 28 , 2014 , rather than go head-to-head with the VMA 's , NBC announced that the ceremony would take place on Monday , August 25 . The move would allow NBC to commit to a preseason '' Sunday Night Football '' broadcast for the 24th ( a game between the Cincinnati Bengals and Arizona Cardinals ) ; it also ensured the tradition of staging the Primetime Emmy Awards the weekend after the Creative Arts Emmy Awards ( that ceremony was already set for August 16 )

		CONTEXT=While in Washington , Lincoln meets his old friend Edgar Allan Poe , who also knows the truth about vampires . Poe tells Lincoln that the vampires are being chased out of their ancestral homes in Europe ( in part because of a public outcry over the bloody atrocities of Elizabeth Báthory ) and are flocking to America because of the slave trade . Poe warns that if the vampires are left unchecked , they will eventually seek to enslave all Americans , white and black . Lincoln leaves Washington in 1849 and declines to seek re-election ; Poe is found murdered that same year in Baltimore , the victim of a vampire attack . In 1857 , Henry summons Lincoln to New York City . Here , Lincoln and fellow vampire slayer William Seward are told that the vampires in the South intend to start a civil war so that they can conquer the north and enslave all humans of America . Lincoln runs for the U.S. Senate and debates Stephen A. Douglas in what became known as the Lincoln – Douglas debates . Although Lincoln loses to Douglas ( an ally of the Southern vampires ) , he gains a great deal of publicity and respect , which allows him to capture the Republican Party nomination for President of the United States and then the office itself

		CONTEXT=Roosevelt returned to the United States in May 1914 . Though he was outraged by the Wilson Administration 's conclusion of a treaty that expressed " sincere regret " for the way in which the United States had acquired the Panama Canal Zone , he was impressed by many of the reforms passed under Wilson . Roosevelt made several campaign appearances for the Progressives , but the 1914 elections were a disaster for the fledgling third party . Roosevelt began to envision another campaign for president , this time with himself at the head of the Republican Party , but conservative party leaders remained opposed to Roosevelt . In hopes of engineering a joint nomination , the Progressives scheduled the 1916 Progressive National Convention at the same time as the 1916 Republican National Convention . When the Republicans nominated Charles Evans Hughes , Roosevelt declined the Progressive nomination and urged his Progressive followers to support the Republican candidate . Though Roosevelt had long disliked Hughes , he disliked Wilson even more , and he campaigned energetically for the Republican nominee . However , Wilson won the 1916 election by a narrow margin . The Progressives disappeared as a party following the 1916 election , and Roosevelt and many of his followers permanently re-joined the Republican Party

		GOLD_MENTION=2010 AFL Rising Star
		CONTEXT=He arrived at the club as an incredibly shy and underdeveloped personality , a fact that was noted by teammate Trent Cotchin who said though Martin was 18 “ he seemed much younger in some of the ways he behaved . ” Indeed , he struggled initially to adjust to the expectations of professional football . In one incident in the 2010 preseason he was removed from training and verbally reprimanded by club leadership when he was deemed unfit to train after a big night out . Despite these struggles , his on-field development was such that he would still debut in the 2010 season 's opening match , a 56-point Richmond loss against at the MCG . Martin recorded the sixth most disposals of any Tiger ( 18 ) to go along with four marks , three tackles and three clearances . Two weeks later Martin was convicted by the AFL tribunal for a high hit on Sydney 's Josh Kennedy in round 3 . He did not receive a suspension for the incident however , returning to football the following week . After four matches Martin ranked fourth in the league for clearances and eighth for hard-ball gets . Media reports emerged after round 8 that the 18 year old Martin had received a significant contract offer from expansion club the Greater Western Sydney Giants . The offer , which the Herald Sun ’s Mark Robinson claimed to be worth $ 2.4 million over three seasons , would have taken effect in the new club 's first AFL season in 2012 . Martin later said he had never entertained the idea of moving to the start-up club . In round 10 he had gained attention for his on-field efforts again , this time being nominated for the 2010 AFL Rising Star award after a 21 disposal and 11 clearance match against Port Adelaide . Due to his previous tribunal conviction however , Martin was ruled ineligible for the award and thus did not officially place in the end of season award 's points tally . He drew the attention of Sydney coach Paul Roos by round 14 , prompting Roos to send veteran Brett Kirk onto Martin in a tagging role . Despite this extra attention , he still managed to record 18 disposals and a goal in the match at the MCG . After 17 rounds Martin ranked second at the club for clearances and inside 50s as well as third for disposals and contested possessions . At the same time he ranked first among that season 's Rising Star nominees in clearances , contested possessions and inside 50s . He was also fourth for average disposals and fifth for average tackles . In round 19 he was rested by the club before returning to play out the final five matches of the season . He missed just that one game in his debut season and finished the year ranked second at Richmond for clearances and inside 50s , as well as third for both contested possessions and disposals . In addition to winning the Fred Swift Medal for fourth place at the club 's best and fairest night , Martin also received six votes in the Brownlow Medal count that year , the most by any Richmond debutant since Craig Lambert in 1988 . At season 's end he reiterated his commitment to the club ( and rejection of the former GWS overtures ) by signing a two-year contract extension that would keep him at Richmond until the end of the 2013 season . The extension was reported by the Herald Sun to be in the vicinity of $ 400,000-a-year

		GOLD_MENTION=2010 MTV Video Music Awards
		CONTEXT=The design team for the series conceived eighteen outfits to compliment Gaga 's outré and eccentric reputation , although they did not collaborate with any of Gaga 's stylists or creative director Nicola Formichetti . Due to the outfits ' unconventional appearances , Jean was given more freedom to animate the large array of costumes , as these rapid changes " would n't be possible in real life " . " There 's a moment in the episode , " Jean resumed , " when she starts out with her hair down . Then , there 's a curtain pulled in front of her , and in seconds , she has a completely different outfit on with a cone bra and her hair is all hairsprayed up and big and frizzy . In real life , that would probably take 8 hours . " Many of the costumes were inspired from previous outfits Gaga had worn , including her meat dress and her Kermit the Frog dress . " We did a lot of research , looking back at her old outfits , and she 's really been in a million different things , had a million different looks . " Many aspects of Gaga 's career are referenced in the episode . " You 're All My Little Monsters " , a musical number specifically created for the episode , is a parody of Gaga 's relationship with her devout " Little Monsters " — a phrase Gaga uses to refer to her fans . To '' Spin '' columnist Devon Maloney , the song was ultimately an overtly cartoonized version of her single " Born This Way " ( 2011 ) that embraces the " freakiness " of Springfield . Several of Gaga 's outfits and looks emulate several iconic costumes the singer had previously worn , such as the " Living Dress " and pyrotechnic leotard she wore during her endeavors on The Monster Ball Tour , as well as her wardrobe at the 53rd Grammy Awards . One in particular , a dress consisting of pork chops , is a parody of the singer 's meat dress , which she wore at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards . During the credits of " Lisa Goes Gaga " , main character Homer Simpson performs a rendition of " Poker Face " ( 2009 ) . At the end of the episode , a title card promotes the Maggie-starring short film '' The Longest Daycare '' , which was shown before '' Ice Age : Continental Drift '' ( 2012 )

		CONTEXT=In April 2010 , six main characters were axed from '' EastEnders '' by executive producer Bryan Kirkwood . Fatboy was not one of them , but Stuart Heritage from '' The Guardian '' felt that he should have been , calling him " A wodge of irritating comic relief ... who is yet to serve a purpose other than making me genuinely dislike young people . ... He must go , preferably in a scene where he falls down the world 's largest flight of stairs . " Heritage later called Fatboy an " obnoxiously two-dimensional dubstep-fixated stock character transparently modelled on Jar Jar Binks . " A writer for the website Watch With Mothers called the character an asset to '' EastEnders '' , expressing pleasure that the show was trying to appeal to younger viewers , while another called him irritating and zany . A writer for '' The Northern Echo '' wondered if Fatboy , along with Leon and Zsa Zsa , brought a new injection of life into the soap or took away screen time from more established characters , and Caroline Fitton , writing for the '' Daily Mail '' , felt that Fatboy 's style of talking was a bit of a cliché . Grace Dent from '' The Guardian '' changed her opinion of Fatboy over time , saying : Julie Emery from '' Heat '' criticised Fatboy 's fashion sense , especially from the episode broadcast on 12 May 2011 , saying " We know clashing prints are soooooo this season , but really , Fatboy , they do nothing for you . And while we 're at it , stop wearing that tinny ' F ' round your neck , for flip 's sake . You 're not a gangster rapper , and anyway your real name 's Arthur . " Emery also said the storyline where Fatboy asks Mercy to marry him so she can stay in the country sounded " somewhat familiar " , as '' Coronation Street '' was featuring a similar storyline at the same time . Amy Duncan from the '' Metro '' said Fatboy was one of her favourite young characters in '' EastEnders '' and said that , with Poppy , he " bring s some much-needed light into the soap " . Vicky Prior from the '' Metro '' said that Fatboy " is easily one of the best characters in '' EastEnders '' , able to interact seamlessly with other characters , both young and old . " Norwood has received four award nominations for his portrayal of Fatboy . In May 2010 , he received a nomination in the " Best Soap Newcomer " category at the 14th TVChoice Awards , and in July he was nominated for " Best Newcomer " at the 2010 Inside Soap Awards , which he went on to win in September .

		CONTEXT=Norman Alfred William Lindsay ( 22 February 1879 – 21 November 1969 ) was an Australian artist , etcher , sculptor , writer , art critic , novelist , cartoonist and amateur boxer . One of the most prolific and popular Australian artists of his generation , Lindsay attracted both acclaim and controversy for his works , many of which infused the Australian landscape with erotic pagan elements and were deemed by his critics to be " anti-Christian , anti-social and degenerate " . A vocal nationalist , he became a regular artist for The Bulletin at the height of its cultural influence , and advanced staunchly anti- modernist views as a leading writer on Australian art . When friend and literary critic Bertram Stevens argued that children like to read about fairies rather than food , Lindsay wrote and illustrated The Magic Pudding ( 1918 ) , now considered a classic work of Australian children 's literature .

		ANSWER=Florence Welch
		GOLD_MENTION=Brit Awards
		CONTEXT='' Lungs '' received generally positive reviews from music critics . At Metacritic , which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications , the album received an average score of 79 , based on 22 reviews . James Christopher Monger of AllMusic praised it as " one of the most musically mature and emotionally mesmerizing albums of 2009 " and stated , " With an arsenal of weaponry that included the daring musicality of Kate Bush , the fearless delivery of Sinéad O'Connor , and the dark , unhinged vulnerability of Fiona Apple , the London native crafted a debut that not only lived up to the machine-gun spray of buzz that heralded her arrival , but easily surpassed it . " Ryan Dombal wrote for '' Pitchfork '' that Florence Welch " bursts mouth wide wide over garage rock , epic soul , pint-tipping Britbeat , and — best of all — a mystic brand of pop that 's part Annie Lennox , Grace Slick , and Joanna Newsom . " '' Q '' noted that " there 's a lot going on , but Welch never confuses breadth with depth " . '' Entertainment Weekly '' s Joseph Brannigan Lynch opined that Welch 's " immaculately constructed indie pop recalls Regina Spektor , but without the studied artiness : Welch is more concerned with raw emotional release . " '' Spin '' s Melissa Maerz stated , " From the way she sings , in big gulps and '' Teen Wolf '' growls , to the mystical art-rock ballads she bedazzles with sleigh bells , harps , and choirs , there 's enough drama here for a Broadway musical . But her delivery is so raw that every mess feels genuine . " '' Rolling Stone '' s Jon Dolan expressed that " t he best bits feel like being chased through a moonless night by a sexy moor witch . " '' Slant Magazine '' s Nick Day referred to the band 's music as " particularly sensitive to studio gloss " and praised Welch 's singing as " a fine balance between elegance and frenzy . " In a review for '' The Guardian '' , Dave Simpson viewed that Welch " has created a sonic labyrinth of xylophones , percussion , Gregorian chants and werewolves . It can sound affected , occasionally crass , but there 's enough adventure to make this worth backing for the Mercury . " Jamie Fullerton of '' NME '' commended the work of producers James Ford and Paul Epworth , writing that they " create epic cauldron-swirls of '' Terminator '' - theme drums , Massive Attack atmospherics and twinkle-eye harp matched by Florence 's grappling of skyward choruses " , but found that " with the likes of ' I 'm Not Calling You A Liar ' and ' Howl ' boasting similarly windy production yet no identifiable tunes the results sound aimless — if harmless . " Genevieve Koski of '' The A.V. Club '' felt that " a t times , '' Lungs '' borders on exhausting , careening as it does from one over-the-top track to the next . ... But with a voice as strong and emotive as hers , it 's not surprising that Welch has little use for moments of quiet contemplation . " Despite criticising instances of " over-smoothed " production on certain tracks , '' The Observer '' s Sheryl Garratt concluded that " there 's a real joy about this debut . It 's the sound of someone who has found their voice and is keen to use it – as loudly and freely as possible . " '' Lungs '' was shortlisted for the 2009 Mercury Prize . The following year , the album won the MasterCard British Album award at the Brit Awards

The offer , which the Herald Sun ’s Mark Robinson claimed to be worth $ 2.4 million over three seasons , would have taken effect in the new club 's first AFL season in 2012 . Martin later said he had never entertained the idea of moving to the start-up club . In round 10 he had gained attention for his on-field efforts again , this time being nominated for the 2010 AFL Rising Star award after a 21 disposal and 11 clearance match against Port Adelaide . Due to his previous tribunal conviction however , Martin was ruled ineligible for the award and thus did not officially place in the end of season award 's points tally . He drew the attention of Sydney coach Paul Roos by round 14 , prompting Roos to send veteran Brett Kirk onto Martin in a tagging role . Despite this extra attention , he still managed to record 18 disposals and a goal in the match at the MCG . After 17 rounds Martin ranked second at the club for clearances and inside 50s as well as third for disposals and contested possessions . At the same time he ranked first among that season 's Rising Star nominees in clearances , contested possessions and inside 50s . He was also fourth for average disposals and fifth for average tackles . In round 19 he was rested by the club before returning to play out the final five matches of the season . He missed just that one game in his debut season and finished the year ranked second at Richmond for clearances and inside 50s , as well as third for both contested possessions and disposals . In addition to winning the Fred Swift Medal for fourth place at the club 's best and fairest night , Martin also received six votes in the Brownlow Medal count that year , the most by any Richmond debutant since Craig Lambert in 1988 . At season 's end he reiterated his commitment to the club ( and rejection of the former GWS overtures ) by signing a two-year contract extension that would keep him at Richmond until the end of the 2013 season . The extension was reported by the Herald Sun to be in the vicinity of $ 400,000-a-year

		CONTEXT=The " Take a Bow " video was a source of inspiration for Justin Timberlake 's music video for his 2006 single , " SexyBack " . According to Timberlake , he decided to work with director Michael Haussman on his " SexyBack " video because " Take a Bow " is one of his favorite Madonna videos . He went on to say " Even today , I still remember the visuals , the images , how he captured her . A lot of times , Madonna seems like she 's the person in control , and in that video , she seemed vulnerable . It was a cool thing to see . " According to director Dave Meyers , the music video for Britney Spears ' 2009 single " Radar " is a " tribute " to Madonna 's " Take a Bow " video . When speaking of Spears and the " Radar " video , Meyers explained , " we were looking for a way to take her into a contemporary , classy environment . I felt empowered by referencing Madonna 's ' Take a Bow ' video . Britney has n't done anything like that . " On January 30 , 1995 , Madonna performed " Take a Bow " on the American Music Awards of 1995 , accompanied by Babyface and a full orchestra . Babyface said the performance was terrifying for him : " I was nervous as hell . But you could n't actually see my legs shaking under the suit . When we finished , she told me she had never been that nervous before . That was crazy to me -- I was thinking , ' You 're Madonna , you 're on stage all the time ! ' " . On February 18 , 1995 , Madonna arrived in Europe to promote '' Bedtime Stories '' ; that same day , she appeared on German TV show '' Wetten , dass . . ?

		CONTEXT=The show received a mixed reception from media publications . On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes , the show holds an approval rating of 43 % based on 30 critics , and summarized , " The 90th Academy Awards played it safe and hit no major snags -- but by clocking in at over four hours , returning host Jimmy Kimmel and company wore out their welcome long before the surprise ending . " Hank Stuever of '' The Washington Post '' marked , " In his second year , Kimmel has shown that the telecast need n't be anything but sharp and sure , with a funny host whose bits are manageable , shareable and – best of all – forgotten . We 're not making showbiz history here ; we 're just trying to get through another Oscar night . " Chief critic David Edelstein of '' Vulture '' wrote , " This was the best , most inspiring , and most sheerly likable Academy Awards telecast I 've ever seen . ... It was also – in terms of the actual awards – among the most disappointing . " '' Vanity Fair '' s , Richard Lawson wrote , " As a host , Kimmel struck a careful , appropriately measured tone ... All told , Sunday 's ceremony did an admirable job of recognizing all the turmoil surrounding it while maintaining the silly , chintzy trappings that so many of us tune into the Oscars for . " CNN 's Brian Lowry quipped , " The Oscars are a big , unwieldy beast , which invariably try to serve too many masters . Yet if the intent was ultimately to maintain a celebratory tone without ignoring either the outside world or the elephant in the room throughout this year 's awards , host Jimmy Kimmel and the show itself largely succeeded . " Others were more critical of the show . Television critic Maureen Ryan of '' Variety '' said , " All things considered , the show had a more or less low-key vibe . Normally it takes about two hours for the numbing effect to set in , but despite host Jimmy Kimmel 's best efforts , Sunday 's telecast started to feel a bit languid and low-energy far earlier . " Television critic James Poniewozik of '' The New York Times '' said , " despite the recent upheaval in Hollywood , the ceremony at large still focused mainly on celebration and glitter literally , in the case of the blinding set , which looked as if the ceremony were encased in an enormous geode . There 's also the perennial problem of bloat . The hitch , of course , is that every part of the show has its constituency . " Darren Franich of '' Entertainment Weekly '' wrote , " What fun we had at this year 's Oscars ! Long show , sure , but where to cut it ? " Writing for '' Deadline '' Greg Evans said , " Did the nearly four-hour running time contain any moments for the Oscar ages ? Probably not . " David Wiegand of the '' San Francisco Chronicle '' wrote , " Even the hope that the noise of clapping might keep the audience at home and in the theater awake , there was little of that for anything except the entrance of actors of advance age . " '' The Oregonian '' columnist Kristi Turnquist wrote , " Was it respectful ? Absolutely . Did it make for kind of a dull , earnest Oscars show ? Yeah , kind of . " Attaining 26.5 million U.S. viewers according to Nielsen ratings , the ceremony 's telecast had a 16-percent drop in viewership from last year 's ceremony and had the lowest U.S. viewership in Oscar history . On March 6 , after the final ratings were confirmed , President Donald Trump took to his Twitter account , saying , " Lowest rated Oscars in HISTORY . Problem is , we do n't have stars anymore – except your President ( just kidding , of course ) ! " . In response , Kimmel also tweeted , saying , " Thanks , lowest rated President in HISTORY . " In July 2018 , the ceremony presentation received eight nominations for the 70th Primetime Creative Arts Emmys

		CONTEXT=After the commercial lackluster of her eighth studio album , '' Britney Jean '' ( 2013 ) , Spears started her Las Vegas residency show , Britney : Piece of Me , which attained commercial success . Later , in September 2014 , Spears posted a picture of herself in the studio , hinting that she was recording new music . In another interview , a month later , she revealed that she was working " very slowly , but progressively " on the album . In 2015 , she released the song " Pretty Girls " with Iggy Azalea , however the song was met with moderate impact and Spears headed back to the studio to record more songs , but did n't have plans to release a new album . In November 2015 , Spears teased on her Instagram account that she was working with songwriters Justin Tranter and Julia Michaels , by posting a picture of them looking " bemused " with the caption : " Working hard and hardly working ... new album ... wheeeee ! . " A month later , Tranter gave an interview for website NewNowNext about his work with Spears and commented : " Working with Britney is a fucking dream . She is so sweet , so inspiring and a master on the mic . Me and Julia had to leave the studio one day because our screams of excitement after every take she did were distracting the producers . " In late 2016 , during interviews to promote the album , Spears declared that she wanted to explore new things on the record , and that it was her " most hip-hop album , " explaining : " ... there are like two or three songs that go in the direction of more urban that I 've wanted to do for a long time now , and I just have n't really done that . " In May 2016 , in an exclusive interview for website '' Breathe Heavy '' , Tranter revealed : " Nobody ever talks about Britney as a writer and she ’s f " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " was written by Mattias Larsson , Robin Fredriksson , Julia Michaels , Justin Tranter and Sandy Chila , with production being done by Mattman & Robin . Mattman & Robin were also responsible for programming , drums , percussion , snaps , handclaps , synths , guitars , bass and kalimba , while Michaels and Jermaine Jackson provided background vocals . It was recorded at 158 Studios , Westlake Village , California , The Studio at the Palms , Las Vegas , Nevada , and at Wolf Cousins Studios , Stockholm , Sweden . " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is an electropop , and dance-pop song that lasts for three minutes and twenty-two seconds ( 3:22 ) . It features " subtle keyboards , a strummed guitar , " and " wobbly bass " in its instrumentation . For Brian Josephs of '' Spin '' , the song 's guitar slaps " recall her 2001 single ' I 'm a Slave 4 U. ' " Other critics also felt that the " strummed flamenco guitar " on the song is similar to those on Justin Timberlake 's " Like I Love You " . Bianca Gracie of '' Fuse '' opined that the song reminded her of " the glory days ( no pun intended ) of ' Circus ' and ' Femme Fatale ' . " Lyrically , " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is a flirty song about Spears " offer ing several reasons why her lover should come over and options , which can be seen in the lines " Nobody should be alone if they do n't have to be " and " I could get into that kissin ' and touchin ' / Or we could be good and do next to nothin ' . " Amy Roberts of '' Bustle '' noted that the lyrics are about hooking up , adding that they " celebrate the idea that casual relationships do n't need to be lacking respect or understanding . You do n't have to be in love with , or committing to , the person that you 're hooking up with , but that also does n't mean that you ca n't connect with them on a different level than just sex . In fact , Spears makes it clear that it 's kind of even cool if her hook-up does n't want to have sex . Her partner can draw the boundaries of where the massage she 's offering starts and ends , and if it remains as nothing more than a back rub then so be it – that 's totally cool . " For Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine , the song features " some dubious lyrics that seem to suggest masturbatory self-love " in the lines : " All I want is what you want/And all you want is me . " The chorus of the song features " a shouted gang " of backup singers , singing : " Whatever you want / whatever you need / I 'll do it ! . " Lewis Corner of Digital Spy called it " a thumping pop anthem , " praising " Britney 's seductive vocal delivery . " Gil Kaufman of '' Billboard '' named it a " fun , flirty " track . Bianca Gracie of '' Fuse '' described it as a " pulsating track that is a flirty booty call that is bound to own the dance floor . " Robbie Daw of Idolator found it to be " a traditional Spears-style chunk of dance-pop " and " arguably the best yet , with its thick whomping bass and that sparkling ' nobody should be alone if they do n't have to be ' breakdown . " Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine called it " impeccably produced downstairs music , " adding that it " is an irresistible slice of dance-pop , with an ebullient bassline and staccato acoustic guitar . " Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic declared that " some of the highlights on the album are the silliest songs , " citing " Do You Wan na Come Over " 's " overheated flamenco chorus " as an example . Maura Johnston of '' Boston Globe '' said the song was one of the album 's high points , noting that the song " is jolted to life by the slashed guitars that helped make ' Toxic ' a pop thrill . " John Murphy of musicOMH was positive while noting that the track " has a rush and urgency about it which marks it out as one of the album 's best songs . " Nolan Feeney of '' Entertainment Weekly '' also picked it as a highlight , praising the " acoustic guitars and gurgling bass lines that make for one freaky pop experiment . " Alex Macpherson of '' The Guardian '' wrote that the song " takes the party back to Britney 's heyday , " praising the inclusion of the flamenco guitar . For '' Los Angeles Times '' writer Mikael Wood , the song " restore s some of the sonic invention that once defined Spears ' biggest hits . " Nick Levine , writing for '' NME '' , echoed the same thought , writing : " The lusty strut of ‘ Do You Wan na Come Over ? ’ nods to her early-noughties Neptunes-produced hits . " In his Vice column , Robert Christgau selected " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " and " Clumsy " as his favorite tracks on the album . Amy Mackelden of '' Bustle '' elaborated about the track : With a strong '90s vibe , an upbeat tempo , and a surprising rhythm , " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " utilizes the best of Spears ' talents . ... " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " embraces the current trend for songs that are musically complicated , that layer up their beats and sound effects , and feature multiple voices and infectious shouting during their choruses . Much like Hailee Steinfeld and Gwen Stefani 's latest offerings , " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is melodic , has a fast tempo , and is instantly recognizable . And most importantly , it 's fun . On August 18 , 2016 , Spears added " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " , as well as " Make Me ... " , to the setlist of her Las Vegas residency show Britney : Piece of Me . Later , on September 1 , 2016 , a performance of the song was broadcast from Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas for Today . During the performance , she used " an outfit similar to her risqué costume from 2016 's VMAs , while her backup dancers stood out in brightly-colored tank tops and shorts , " as reported by '' Entertainment Weekly '' Ruth Kinane . The song was also included in Spears 's setlist for the iHeartRadio Music Festival on September 24 , 2016 . Spears also performed it at I Heart Radio Jingle Ball , Triple Show and B26 Pepsi Jingle Bash during December 2016 . Also performed it at Apple Music Festival which was held in United Kingdom

According to review aggregator Metacritic , the album has a score of 48/100 based on 8 reviews , indicating " mixed or average reviews " . On another aggregator website , Album of the Year , it holds the 4th position on a list of worst reviewed albums of 2014 . Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic gave the album 2.5 stars out of 5 saying that " Michele is not a natural pop star . This was true in 2009 when she debuted on '' Glee '' as Rachel Berry and it 's even clearer in 2014 . " Mike Ayers from '' Billboard '' gave a mostly positive review , saying , " Lyrically , '' Louder '' is rather one-sided , as she often sings about the perils of relationships , over and over , in ways that we 've all heard many times at this point . Still , it 's a solid effort that shows she has promise as a bonafide pop artist . " Sarah Rodman of '' The Boston Globe '' gave the album a mostly positive review , writing , " The Broadway veteran puts her mighty soprano through its paces on bouncy dance tracks , soaring ballads , and midtempo pop tunes where she straddles the line , mostly comfortably , between Katy Perry and Celine Dion . " Kyle Anderson of '' Entertainment Weekly '' gave the album a B - , writing , " It 's hard to be that mad at '' Louder '' , because it 's so admirably and lovingly crafted . There 's nothing wrong with Lea Michele 's debut , and that 's its biggest problem . While well curated and exquisitely executed , '' Louder '' is missing the visceral oomph that defines the gulf between superstars and the rest of the top 40 chum . " At '' USA Today '' , Jerry Shriver rated the album 2.5 stars out of four , and stated that " softer would have been a better approach . " He added that the song " Battlefield " points to a more promising direction . Kevin McFarland of '' The A.V.

This was true in 2009 when she debuted on '' Glee '' as Rachel Berry and it 's even clearer in 2014 . " Mike Ayers from '' Billboard '' gave a mostly positive review , saying , " Lyrically , '' Louder '' is rather one-sided , as she often sings about the perils of relationships , over and over , in ways that we 've all heard many times at this point . Still , it 's a solid effort that shows she has promise as a bonafide pop artist .

" Kyle Anderson of '' Entertainment Weekly '' gave the album a B - , writing , " It 's hard to be that mad at '' Louder '' , because it 's so admirably and lovingly crafted . There 's nothing wrong with Lea Michele 's debut , and that 's its biggest problem . While well curated and exquisitely executed , '' Louder '' is missing the visceral oomph that defines the gulf between superstars and the rest of the top 40 chum . " At '' USA Today '' , Jerry Shriver rated the album 2.5 stars out of four , and stated that " softer would have been a better approach . " He added that the song " Battlefield " points to a more promising direction . Kevin McFarland of '' The A.V.

" is a flirty song about Spears " offer ing several reasons why her lover should come over and options , which can be seen in the lines " Nobody should be alone if they do n't have to be " and " I could get into that kissin ' and touchin ' / Or we could be good and do next to nothin ' . " Amy Roberts of '' Bustle '' noted that the lyrics are about hooking up , adding that they " celebrate the idea that casual relationships do n't need to be lacking respect or understanding . You do n't have to be in love with , or committing to , the person that you 're hooking up with , but that also does n't mean that you ca n't connect with them on a different level than just sex . In fact , Spears makes it clear that it 's kind of even cool if her hook-up does n't want to have sex . Her partner can draw the boundaries of where the massage she 's offering starts and ends , and if it remains as nothing more than a back rub then so be it – that 's totally cool . " For Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine , the song features " some dubious lyrics that seem to suggest masturbatory self-love " in the lines : " All I want is what you want/And all you want is me . " The chorus of the song features " a shouted gang " of backup singers , singing : " Whatever you want / whatever you need / I 'll do it ! . " Lewis Corner of Digital Spy called it " a thumping pop anthem , " praising " Britney 's seductive vocal delivery . " Gil Kaufman of '' Billboard '' named it a " fun , flirty " track . Bianca Gracie of '' Fuse '' described it as a " pulsating track that is a flirty booty call that is bound to own the dance floor . " Robbie Daw of Idolator found it to be " a traditional Spears-style chunk of dance-pop " and " arguably the best yet , with its thick whomping bass and that sparkling ' nobody should be alone if they do n't have to be ' breakdown . " Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine called it " impeccably produced downstairs music , " adding that it " is an irresistible slice of dance-pop , with an ebullient bassline and staccato acoustic guitar . " Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic declared that " some of the highlights on the album are the silliest songs , " citing " Do You Wan na Come Over " 's " overheated flamenco chorus " as an example . Maura Johnston of '' Boston Globe '' said the song was one of the album 's high points , noting that the song " is jolted to life by the slashed guitars that helped make ' Toxic ' a pop thrill . " John Murphy of musicOMH was positive while noting that the track " has a rush and urgency about it which marks it out as one of the album 's best songs . " Nolan Feeney of '' Entertainment Weekly '' also picked it as a highlight , praising the " acoustic guitars and gurgling bass lines that make for one freaky pop experiment . " Alex Macpherson of '' The Guardian '' wrote that the song " takes the party back to Britney 's heyday , " praising the inclusion of the flamenco guitar . For '' Los Angeles Times '' writer Mikael Wood , the song " restore s some of the sonic invention that once defined Spears ' biggest hits . " Nick Levine , writing for '' NME '' , echoed the same thought , writing : " The lusty strut of ‘ Do You Wan na Come Over ? ’ nods to her early-noughties Neptunes-produced hits . " In his Vice column , Robert Christgau selected " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " and " Clumsy " as his favorite tracks on the album . Amy Mackelden of '' Bustle '' elaborated about the track : With a strong '90s vibe , an upbeat tempo , and a surprising rhythm , " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " utilizes the best of Spears ' talents . ... " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " embraces the current trend for songs that are musically complicated , that layer up their beats and sound effects , and feature multiple voices and infectious shouting during their choruses . Much like Hailee Steinfeld and Gwen Stefani 's latest offerings , " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is melodic , has a fast tempo , and is instantly recognizable . And most importantly , it 's fun . On August 18 , 2016 , Spears added " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " , as well as " Make Me ... " , to the setlist of her Las Vegas residency show Britney : Piece of Me . Later , on September 1 , 2016 , a performance of the song was broadcast from Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas for Today . During the performance , she used " an outfit similar to her risqué costume from 2016 's VMAs , while her backup dancers stood out in brightly-colored tank tops and shorts , " as reported by '' Entertainment Weekly '' Ruth Kinane . The song was also included in Spears 's setlist for the iHeartRadio Music Festival on September 24 , 2016 . Spears also performed it at I Heart Radio Jingle Ball , Triple Show and B26 Pepsi Jingle Bash during December 2016 . Also performed it at Apple Music Festival which was held in United Kingdom

" A month later , Tranter gave an interview for website NewNowNext about his work with Spears and commented : " Working with Britney is a fucking dream . She is so sweet , so inspiring and a master on the mic . Me and Julia had to leave the studio one day because our screams of excitement after every take she did were distracting the producers .

" In May 2016 , in an exclusive interview for website '' Breathe Heavy '' , Tranter revealed : " Nobody ever talks about Britney as a writer and she ’s f " Do You Wan na Come Over ?

Check it out ! " , said Will . " Then I go dirty Caribbean on him on the last verse . " Monica Herrera wrote for '' Billboard '' that " the music is expertly produced , but problems arise when Will.i.am claims the same of his wordplay . On the track ' Do n't Stop the Party ' , he chest-thumps , ' Kill you with my lyricals/Call me verbal criminal . ' It 's a silly boast for an artist who clearly focuses on beats over rhymes , and is probably better off for it . " Andy Gill wrote for '' The Independent '' that " with martial synth-stomp riffs , spartan electro beats and loping bass grooves driving tracks whose single-mindedness is signalled by titles like ' Do n't Stop the Party ' . " A positive review came from Bill Lamb , editor from About.com , who went to say that : " BEP boost the beat as they request ' Do n't Stop the Party ' . " Lamb said that " will.i.am starts talking about futurism here again and sure enough we find ourselves in the middle of a futuristic sounding trance break . The party reaches its peak about five minutes into the song , and it is exhilarating . " Other positive reaction came from John Bush , editor from Allmusic who went to say that the song is a " scattered moment of respectability " and chose it as an " AMG Pick " . Gavin Martin wrote for '' Daily Mirror '' that " the operatically ambitious ' Do n't Stop the Party ' gives way to a briefly terrifying interlude that is more or less a declaration of earth-shaking sonic war . " The music video , which is directed by Ben Mor , features on-stage and backstage footages of the group during their ' The E.N.D. World Tour ' in Brazil in 2010 and was released to iTunes and YouTube/VEVO on May 10 , 2011 .

		ANSWER=Roman 's Revenge
		GOLD_MENTION=2011 MTV Video Music Awards
		CONTEXT=Lyrically , " Roman 's Revenge " has been described as " unrelenting " , " bonkers " , " angry " and " outrageous " . Critics found Minaj 's lyrics as intense and incisive , but Eminem 's rap has been noted as being similar to his earlier work and contains misogyny and homophobia . Many critics questioned Minaj 's alter-ego , Roman Zolanski , as being an " angry gay male " because it was expected that the rappers would go toe-to-toe in-between verses . The song makes references to Disney 's Princess Jasmine and Aladdin , iPods , and New York Giant Eli Manning as well as the song " Scenario " by A Tribe Called Quest , the latter of which is referenced through the line " Rawr , rawr like a dungeon dragon " which is taken from Busta Rhymes ' verse in " Scenario . " David Jeffries of '' AllMusic '' called the song the key track of the album , referring to Minaj as a savage as she " roars like a tiger " while standing up to Eminem . Brad Wete of '' Entertainment Weekly '' called the song " merciless " , as Nicki/Roman tears into the song with lyrics firing at whoever they are meant to be fired at . Alexis Petridis of '' The Guardian '' praised the song 's eerie and vulgar tone , referring to Minaj 's tone of voice as " thrilling , quivering & edge-of-panic . " Margaret Wappler of '' Los Angeles Times '' complemented Minaj 's " huffing and puffing " at Eminem 's alter-ego , while both characters exchange violent lyrics . Praising the song as the main track of the album , Scott Plagenhoef of '' Pitchfork Media '' complimented the song as aggressive and pointed out Eminem 's use of " recycling his Shady-circa-99 persona .

		CONTEXT=Unlike his previous record primarily focused on R&B and pop genres , '' FutureSex/LoveSounds '' is less concentrated on one particular sound , thus representing a wider range . Timberlake explains , " It 's more broad as far as the styles I wanted to mix in to my own type of thing . " A musically " complex " album , '' FutureSex/LoveSounds '' is a fusion of rap , rock , funk , soul , gospel , new wave , opera , and world music , characterized by preludes and interludes interspersed on the album 's tracks . '' Entertainment Weekly '' noted that the album 's sound is a " sonic departure " from both NSYNC and '' Justified '' . Although " What Goes Around " sounds similar to '' Justified '' , Timberlake admitted that it is the only song in the new album to have such similarity . '' The 20/20 Experience '' is a neo soul album partly inspired by the expansive song structures of 1960s and 1970s rock . Mikael Wood of the '' Los Angeles Times '' found its elaborate structures ambitious in the vein of Stevie Wonder , Prince , and Michael Jackson . Since his marriage , he incorporated themes of romance in his songwriting , as '' Complex '' noted , showing that he " writes his tracks on his emotions , leaving him with a career of personal albums . " Moments of emotional pain after betrayal influenced the songwriting of some previous records . Longtime critic Robert Hilburn for the '' Los Angeles Times '' praised Timberlake 's act after attending the Justified and Stripped Tour in 2003 , considering him " born for the stage ( with ) the savvy instincts to put together a show that works . Rather than make himself the constant center of attention , he was comfortable enough at times simply to be part of a talented ensemble . " In 2013 , Timberlake introduced his big-band orchestra called the Tennessee Kids for Legends of the Summer and The 20/20 Experience World Tour which includes guitarists , dancers , background singers , drummers , bassists , keyboardists , trumpeters , a music coordinator , a percussionist , a saxophonist , among others musicians . The 20/20 Experience allowed Timberlake to throw back to the big-band era , its stage production embraced a vintage sheen and everyone in classic suits . For the tour , Timberlake had a horn section onstage with him called The Regiment Horns . '' The Hollywood Reporter '' 's Emily Zemler described him as a performer who is " genuinely having fun , " whereas Jon Pareles of '' The New York Times '' commented that the singer " reveals something darker , more fiery and intense " while performing post-breakup revenge songs , such as " Cry Me a River " and " What Goes Around ... Comes Around " . '' Billboard '' editor Phil Gallo praised Timberlake 's medley performance at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards , saying he " gave the show its heart and center , " also mentioning his place as a modern recording artist and a solid link in the lineage of the most acclaimed performers in the show 's history . '' The New York Times ' '' editor Katie Rogers highlighted Timberlake 's crossover appeal after his performance with Chris Stapleton at the 2015 Country Music Association Awards . Described by critics as a " consummate showman , " Timberlake usually plays guitar , piano and keyboard in his shows

		CONTEXT=This is one of three tracks on '' The Beginning '' to be produced by Damien " DJ Ammo " LeRoy , the other two being the lead single " The Time ( Dirty Bit ) " and " Do It Like This " . '' The Beginning '' 's third single was announced on The Black Eyed Peas ' official website on May 9 , 2011 . Described as a " buzzing , hot club jam " , it features whooshing synths and slap-funk bass grooves . It is the longest track on the album at close to six minutes . The Black Eyed Peas member will.i.am told '' Spin '' magazine that he is proud enough of the song that he 'd even play it for Jay-Z . " I would go to Jay 's studio and play this be like ' Boom ! Check it out ! " , said Will . " Then I go dirty Caribbean on him on the last verse . " Monica Herrera wrote for '' Billboard '' that " the music is expertly produced , but problems arise when Will.i.am claims the same of his wordplay . On the track ' Do n't Stop the Party ' , he chest-thumps , ' Kill you with my lyricals/Call me verbal criminal . ' It 's a silly boast for an artist who clearly focuses on beats over rhymes , and is probably better off for it . " Andy Gill wrote for '' The Independent '' that " with martial synth-stomp riffs , spartan electro beats and loping bass grooves driving tracks whose single-mindedness is signalled by titles like ' Do n't Stop the Party ' . " A positive review came from Bill Lamb , editor from About.com , who went to say that : " BEP boost the beat as they request ' Do n't Stop the Party ' . " Lamb said that " will.i.am starts talking about futurism here again and sure enough we find ourselves in the middle of a futuristic sounding trance break . The party reaches its peak about five minutes into the song , and it is exhilarating . " Other positive reaction came from John Bush , editor from Allmusic who went to say that the song is a " scattered moment of respectability " and chose it as an " AMG Pick " . Gavin Martin wrote for '' Daily Mirror '' that " the operatically ambitious ' Do n't Stop the Party ' gives way to a briefly terrifying interlude that is more or less a declaration of earth-shaking sonic war . " The music video , which is directed by Ben Mor , features on-stage and backstage footages of the group during their ' The E.N.D. World Tour ' in Brazil in 2010 and was released to iTunes and YouTube/VEVO on May 10 , 2011 . Beside live footage of the tour , the video also features panoramic shoots of Brazilian landscapes and city life .

		GOLD_MENTION=criminal trials of the 1930s
		CONTEXT=According to the ITAR-TASS news agency , the prosecution stated that Khabarov 's group planned to launch an operation codenamed “ Dawn ” to overthrow official authorities in the region . Many prominent figures in Russian politics expressed outrage about Khabarov 's imprisonment . Among them are individuals with diametrically opposed political views such as the presidential candidates Leonid Ivashov and Gennady Zyuganov , as well as other political figures , such as Andrey Illarionov , Andrey Savelyev , Maxim Shevchenko , Alexey Dymovsky , Maxim Kalashnikov , Irek Murtazin , Mikhail Delyagin , Ashot Egiazaryan , Aleksandr Kharchikov , Dmitry Puchkov , '' et al. '' They said that the accusations do not hold water , pointing to the ridiculousness of the collected “ evidence ” against Khabarov . Khabarov 's colleague , Col. Vladislav Zyomkovsky , said during an interview with '' PublicPost '' , that officially announced denunciation of a failed masterplan doesn ′ t stand up to critical examination , and if examined , the argument simply falls to the ground . In his opinion , a brilliant military strategist such as Khabarov , would never develop such an obvious plan . To refute the official version of the failed plot , Zyomkovsky cited one paragraph from Khabarov 's bill of indictment , which states that Khabarov and his alleged accomplices planned to switch off the entire region 's electrical grid , and thus create panic and civil disorder . In his opinion , this passage was copypasted from an indictment of the criminal trials of the 1930s , when such an event would really have spread chaos . But in the 2000s in Russia , electrical outages happened on a daily basis , were routine and a quite common occurrence

		ANSWER=mechanism to coexist alongside central planning
		GOLD_MENTION=
		CONTEXT=Agriculture in the Soviet Union was mostly collectivized , with some limited cultivation of private plots . It is often viewed as one of the more inefficient sectors of the economy of the Soviet Union . A number of food taxes ( prodrazverstka , prodnalog , and others ) were introduced in the early Soviet period despite the Decree on Land that immediately followed the October Revolution . The forced collectivization and class war against ( vaguely defined ) " kulaks " under Stalinism greatly disrupted farm output in the 1920s and 1930s , contributing to the Soviet famine of 1932 – 33 ( most especially the holodomor in Ukraine ) . A system of state and collective farms , known as sovkhozes and kolkhozes , respectively , placed the rural population in a system intended to be unprecedentedly productive and fair but which turned out to be chronically inefficient and lacking in fairness . Under the administrations of Nikita Khrushchev , Leonid Brezhnev , and Mikhail Gorbachev , many reforms ( such as Khrushchev 's Virgin Lands Campaign ) were enacted as attempts to defray the inefficiencies of the Stalinist agricultural system . However , Marxist – Leninist ideology did not allow for any substantial amount of market mechanism to coexist alongside central planning , so the private plot fraction of Soviet agriculture , which was its most productive , remained confined to a limited role . Throughout its later decades the Soviet Union never stopped using substantial portions of the precious metals mined each year in Siberia to pay for grain imports , which has been taken by various authors as an economic indicator showing that the country 's agriculture was never as successful as it ought to have been . The real numbers , however , were treated as state secrets at the time , so accurate analysis of the sector 's performance was limited outside the USSR and nearly impossible to assemble within its borders . However , Soviet citizens as consumers were familiar with the fact that foods , especially meats , were often noticeably scarce , to the point that not lack of money so much as lack of things to buy with it was the limiting factor in their standard of living .

During the Second World War , after the death of his son Leonid , he asked Stalin in a letter to release his imprisoned son Peter , but he was subsequently shot . Petrovsky died in 1958

		GOLD_MENTION=64th World Science Fiction Convention
		CONTEXT=In August , 2006 , at the 64th World Science Fiction Convention , in a give-and-take with her audience , Willis described her novel-in-progress : " It 's about World War 2 , and I have four historians ... One of them is with the evacuating children in the North of England ; one of them is doing the Blitz ; one of them is doing the civilian evacuation from Dunkirk , '' of '' soldiers but '' by '' civilians ; and one of them is doing the Intelligence War involved in the lead-up to D-Day , where they fooled Hitler into thinking we were attacking at Calais , instead of at Normandy . And their lives are hopelessly intertwined ; but then they all get in trouble &mdash; you know my books &mdash; they all get in terrible trouble and ca n't get out of it . And are stuck in World War II , for God 's sake ! So : Not a safe place to be . " ( An audience member called , " Better than the Plague ! " ) Willis laughed but replied , " Not necessarily better than the Plague ! In slightly better survival chance because they have the advantage of some knowledge that the locals do n't have , but then again , historical events are notoriously inaccurate , and just because you think you know where all the bombs fell , does n't mean you do . So that will figure heavily in the book ... I have a lot of stuff to tell you about the war ... The Brits were absolutely wonderful ... They '' were '' great and plucky and funny under pressure . " In a February 12 , 2010 interview Connie Willis said : What are '' Blackout '' and '' All Clear '' about ? They 're about Dunkirk and ration books and D-Day and V-1 rockets , about tube shelters and Bletchley Park and gas masks and stirrup pumps and Christmas pantomimes and cows and crossword puzzles and the deception campaign . And mostly the book 's about all the people who " did their bit " to save the world from Hitler &mdash; Shakespearean actors and ambulance drivers and vicars and landladies and nurses and WRENs and RAF pilots and Winston Churchill and General Patton and Agatha Christie &mdash; heroes all . Michael Dirda of '' The Washington Post '' praised the diptych as " as vivid an evocation of England during World War II as anyone has ever written " and wrote that " '' Blackout '' is , by turns , witty , suspenseful , harrowing and occasionally comic to the point of slapstick . " Adrienne Martini of Locus Online called the 1940s Britain that Willis created " richly textured " . A. M. Dellamonica described the story as " an intricate puzzle " and " a celebration , too , of courage and heroism , of perseverance , of ordinary people doing small things to aid in great causes , of devotion , friendship , keeping one 's word . It has funny characters and laugh out loud moments aplenty , but it is no wacky romp , this book , no '' To Say Nothing of the Dog '' . At the same time , I found it funnier and , strangely , cheerier than previous Willis novels with a comparable body count . " Thomas M. Wagner called '' Blackout '' " an absolute monster of an epic , a time-travel saga so rich in scope that it 's taking two volumes to tell , yet so intimate in its observation of character that what you take away from it are not thrilling action setpieces but those moments of bonding people share — warm , funny , confused , trivial , angry , heartfelt — that take on a new and infinitely greater meaning in the shadow of death ... Amid the growing suspense , Willis builds an engrossing work of humanist fiction that avoids pathos and easy sentiment in depicting the quiet practicality and occasional heroism ( and yes , the callousness ) of Londoners surviving the Blitz . Memorable characters abound , and Willis 's gift for natural dialogue brings scenes to life in a way that makes you feel you 're in their presence . And she never pulls the lame stunt of creating a character for you to love just to kill them as an exercise in cheap button mashing . We get to know every one of the people with whom Polly shares a shelter every night , like the blustery , avuncular stage actor Sir Godfrey Kingsman , who quotes the Bard every time he opens his mouth yet whose personality rings true all the same . Eileen finds herself saddled with two of the most ill-behaved children in history , and yet you kind of like them , especially because , as a sort of brother-and-sister demolition duo with an appallingly indifferent and irresponsible mother , you realize they 've only ever had each other . " Julie Phillips of '' The Village Voice '' wrote , " '' Blackout/All Clear '' is neither tragedy nor comedy , but a mystery story with touches of grief and slapstick ... None of the three historians manages to stand by and observe ... The cast of characters is long , but Willis convinces you to care about almost all their fates — and to surprise you about their connection to each other . Willis 's evocation of wartime London sometimes feels romanticized , and it has few moral or demographic complications ... Nor is Willis 's theme , the heroism of ordinary people , especially original . But by the time the three historians and Mr. Dunworthy have unraveled the mystery and arrived at the full-on , three-hanky finale , you 'll no longer be a disinterested observer . " Some reviewers complained of the length of the books and their narrative modes . Christopher DeFilippis , writing for the SF Site , said he thought the books " can best be described by words like ' belabored ' and ' exasperating . ' That 's because the single story told in '' Blackout '' and '' All Clear '' did n't have to encompass two novels . Had it not been marred by endlessly repetitive prose and character actions , the narrative could have fit neatly into a single volume ... Unfortunately , the bulk of '' Blackout '' is taken up by Polly , Mike and Eileen 's individual realizations that they 're trapped in the past , with each caught in a state of seemingly perpetual denial about their circumstances . Instead of acknowledging the blatant truth of their predicament , they concoct endless mental scenarios as to why their gates wo n't open ... Willis goes on for pages with her protagonists repeatedly ruminating about the same " what ifs " over and over ( and over ) again . It may be understandable in the beginning of the story as the characters adjust to the magnitude of their situation . But it soon becomes apparent that this is what constitutes drama in Willis ' universe and it never stops ... It 's a shame that these negatives so overwhelm '' Blackout '' and '' All Clear '' , because despite them the books feature many terrific characters moving in extremely interesting historical situations . " Similarly , Adam Roberts of '' The Guardian '' wrote , " The result is a mildly interesting 200-page novel about the ordinary heroism of British civilians during the war , bloated to 800 pages via an egregiously handled time-travel conceit , eked out with great jellied quantities of historical research , endless meandering conversations , long passages disposed into that tiresome typographical convention by which characters ' inmost thoughts are spelled out in italics , and a string of inconsequential chapter-end cliffhangers/immediate resolutions that got increasingly on my nerves as the book went on . There 's little overall tension , and the time-travelling historians come over as both panicky and amateurish – an undesirable combination , one might think , where timelines are lying about ready to be mucked up . " He added , though , " The aim is a commendable one . Despite walk-on parts by General Patton , Agatha Christie and Alan Turing , the bulk of the characters in '' All Clear '' are ordinary people getting on with their ordinary lives ... And it ca n't be denied that the subject here , the heroism of ordinary people in testing times , is worthy and honourable . "

" In a February 12 , 2010 interview Connie Willis said : What are '' Blackout '' and '' All Clear '' about ? They 're about Dunkirk and ration books and D-Day and V-1 rockets , about tube shelters and Bletchley Park and gas masks and stirrup pumps and Christmas pantomimes and cows and crossword puzzles and the deception campaign . And mostly the book 's about all the people who " did their bit " to save the world from Hitler &mdash; Shakespearean actors and ambulance drivers and vicars and landladies and nurses and WRENs and RAF pilots and Winston Churchill and General Patton and Agatha Christie &mdash; heroes all . Michael Dirda of '' The Washington Post '' praised the diptych as " as vivid an evocation of England during World War II as anyone has ever written " and wrote that " '' Blackout '' is , by turns , witty , suspenseful , harrowing and occasionally comic to the point of slapstick . " Adrienne Martini of Locus Online called the 1940s Britain that Willis created " richly textured " . A. M. Dellamonica described the story as " an intricate puzzle " and " a celebration , too , of courage and heroism , of perseverance , of ordinary people doing small things to aid in great causes , of devotion , friendship , keeping one 's word . It has funny characters and laugh out loud moments aplenty , but it is no wacky romp , this book , no '' To Say Nothing of the Dog '' . At the same time , I found it funnier and , strangely , cheerier than previous Willis novels with a comparable body count . " Thomas M. Wagner called '' Blackout '' " an absolute monster of an epic , a time-travel saga so rich in scope that it 's taking two volumes to tell , yet so intimate in its observation of character that what you take away from it are not thrilling action setpieces but those moments of bonding people share — warm , funny , confused , trivial , angry , heartfelt — that take on a new and infinitely greater meaning in the shadow of death ... Amid the growing suspense , Willis builds an engrossing work of humanist fiction that avoids pathos and easy sentiment in depicting the quiet practicality and occasional heroism ( and yes , the callousness ) of Londoners surviving the Blitz . Memorable characters abound , and Willis 's gift for natural dialogue brings scenes to life in a way that makes you feel you 're in their presence . And she never pulls the lame stunt of creating a character for you to love just to kill them as an exercise in cheap button mashing . We get to know every one of the people with whom Polly shares a shelter every night , like the blustery , avuncular stage actor Sir Godfrey Kingsman , who quotes the Bard every time he opens his mouth yet whose personality rings true all the same . Eileen finds herself saddled with two of the most ill-behaved children in history , and yet you kind of like them , especially because , as a sort of brother-and-sister demolition duo with an appallingly indifferent and irresponsible mother , you realize they 've only ever had each other . " Julie Phillips of '' The Village Voice '' wrote , " '' Blackout/All Clear '' is neither tragedy nor comedy , but a mystery story with touches of grief and slapstick ... None of the three historians manages to stand by and observe ... The cast of characters is long , but Willis convinces you to care about almost all their fates — and to surprise you about their connection to each other . Willis 's evocation of wartime London sometimes feels romanticized , and it has few moral or demographic complications ... Nor is Willis 's theme , the heroism of ordinary people , especially original . But by the time the three historians and Mr. Dunworthy have unraveled the mystery and arrived at the full-on , three-hanky finale , you 'll no longer be a disinterested observer . " Some reviewers complained of the length of the books and their narrative modes . Christopher DeFilippis , writing for the SF Site , said he thought the books " can best be described by words like ' belabored ' and ' exasperating . ' That 's because the single story told in '' Blackout '' and '' All Clear '' did n't have to encompass two novels . Had it not been marred by endlessly repetitive prose and character actions , the narrative could have fit neatly into a single volume ... Unfortunately , the bulk of '' Blackout '' is taken up by Polly , Mike and Eileen 's individual realizations that they 're trapped in the past , with each caught in a state of seemingly perpetual denial about their circumstances . Instead of acknowledging the blatant truth of their predicament , they concoct endless mental scenarios as to why their gates wo n't open ... Willis goes on for pages with her protagonists repeatedly ruminating about the same " what ifs " over and over ( and over ) again . It may be understandable in the beginning of the story as the characters adjust to the magnitude of their situation . But it soon becomes apparent that this is what constitutes drama in Willis ' universe and it never stops ... It 's a shame that these negatives so overwhelm '' Blackout '' and '' All Clear '' , because despite them the books feature many terrific characters moving in extremely interesting historical situations . " Similarly , Adam Roberts of '' The Guardian '' wrote , " The result is a mildly interesting 200-page novel about the ordinary heroism of British civilians during the war , bloated to 800 pages via an egregiously handled time-travel conceit , eked out with great jellied quantities of historical research , endless meandering conversations , long passages disposed into that tiresome typographical convention by which characters ' inmost thoughts are spelled out in italics , and a string of inconsequential chapter-end cliffhangers/immediate resolutions that got increasingly on my nerves as the book went on . There 's little overall tension , and the time-travelling historians come over as both panicky and amateurish – an undesirable combination , one might think , where timelines are lying about ready to be mucked up . " He added , though , " The aim is a commendable one . Despite walk-on parts by General Patton , Agatha Christie and Alan Turing , the bulk of the characters in '' All Clear '' are ordinary people getting on with their ordinary lives ... And it ca n't be denied that the subject here , the heroism of ordinary people in testing times , is worthy and honourable . "

		ANSWER=Madonna
		GOLD_MENTION=1985 MTV Video Music Awards
		CONTEXT=It was in the video of " Material Girl " that Madonna began to accept and utilize herself being compared to Monroe . However , she established a safe distance from those comparisons and developed inside the same pastiche . Details like the usage of different gloves or different fans in the video brought forth the connections between these women , but Madonna alluded to herself in subtle ways . The fan in Monroe 's hand for the original video was an iconography of the Sudarshana Chakra ( wheel ) held by the Indian idol Vishnu . Scholar Georges-Claude Guilbert , who wrote '' Madonna as postmodern myth : how one star 's self-construction rewrites sex '' , said that the fan symbolized fiery desire aroused by Monroe as well as ritual sacrifice , eerily foreshadowing her untimely death in 1962 . Madonna 's fan , which appeared at the end of the video , signified that Madonna – while paying her tribute to Monroe – was signaling that she had no intention of being a victim like her , and that she was on the path of becoming a feminist post-modern myth . Author Nicholas Cook commented that the video promoted Madonna 's identity as the song suggested , with the purpose of shifting " Madonna 's image from that of a disco-bimbo to authentic star . " Lisa A. Lewis , author of '' Gender , Politics and MTV '' said that with the video , Madonna achieved the rare distinction of being accepted as a literature medium by the music authors . " Material Girl " was nominated for best female video at the 1985 MTV Video Music Awards but lost to Tina Turner 's " What 's Love Got to Do with It " . The video was ranked at position 54 on VH1 's 100 Greatest Videos

		GOLD_MENTION=1990 massacre of Sri Lankan Police officers
		CONTEXT=His handling of the country 's civil war was less successful . In the north , the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam were facing off against the Indian Peace-Keeping Force - the Indian presence on the island was unpopular , and Premadasa requested India to pull out its troops . In order to force the IPKF to leave the island , he authorized a clandestine operation to supply arms to LTTE , a collusion that came to light in the report published by the Sri Lankan Presidential Commission to inquire into the 1992 assassination of Lieutenant General Denzil Kobbekaduwa . While the IPKF was recalled by New Delhi in 1990 , the government 's war with the LTTE resumed , beginning Eelam War II , which ended in a stalemate five years later . The 1990 massacre of Sri Lankan Police officers , which occurred after the policemen were asked to surrender to the LTTE in Batticaloa at Premadasa 's request , was later established to have been performed with the same weapons he had supplied them

		CONTEXT=The Shen - kuang - szu Incident ( Chinese : 神光寺事件 ; Pinyin : Shénguāngsì Shìjiàn ; Foochow Romanized : Sìng - guŏng - sê Sê̤ṳ - giông ) was a series of events that took place between 1850 and 1851 in Fuzhou , China and was marked as one of the earliest conflicts between local Chinese and foreign Protestant missionaries . It began in June 1850 when two English missionaries rented rooms in a temple known as the Shen - kuang - szu on Wu - shih - shan within the walled city of Fuzhou . In the months that followed , local Chinese gentry and officials attempted in various ways to evict the missionaries from the hill , but all their efforts apparently failed . The controversy was settled the following year in October with the terms of the agreement stating that the missionaries were allowed to stay behind . This led to great discontentment amongst the local gentry and eventually foreshadowed yet another more important missionary incident - the 1878 Wu - shih - shan Case .

		ANSWER=Park Chung-hee enabled industrial progress while suppressing the rights of the South Korean people . According to Major Daniel P. Bolger 's analysis , Park enjoyed the emergency powers at his disposal in the time of conflict , which he preserved until 1979
		GOLD_MENTION=assassination
		CONTEXT=In handling the Korean DMZ conflict of 1966 – 1969 , Park Chung-hee enabled industrial progress while suppressing the rights of the South Korean people . According to Major Daniel P. Bolger 's analysis , Park enjoyed the emergency powers at his disposal in the time of conflict , which he preserved until 1979 . The military , intelligence and police forces he consolidated in order to defeat the DPRK and flout the invasion of Ulchin-Samcheok were re-calibrated towards suppressing human rights , domestic opponents and restricting freedom of speech and press . The adoption of the Yusin Constitution on November 21 , 1972 , granted President Park full control over South Korea by co-opting the rule of law until his assassination in 1979 at the hands of secret service chief Kim Jae-kyu . Some historians argue that the consolidation of the military established under Park paved the way for continued authoritarianism even after Park 's demise , as evidenced by General Cheon Hu-hwan 's brief repetition of martial law in 1980 . As a consequence , the accumulation of emergency powers during the time of Ulchin-Samcheok delayed the democratization of South Korea in the long term

		CONTEXT=And Japan was eager to take every opportunity . In 1869 they took advantage of the defeat of the rebels of the Republic of Ezo to incorporate definitely the island of Hokkaido to Japan . For centuries , Japan viewed the Ryukyu Islands as one of its provinces . In 1871 the Mudan incident happened : cannibal Taiwanese aborigines murdered 54 Ryūkyūan sailors that had their ship shipwrecked . At that time the Ryukyu Islands were claimed by both Qing China and Japan , and the Japanese interpreted the incident as an attack on their citizens . They took steps to bring the islands in their jurisdiction : in 1872 the Japanese Ryukyu Domain was declared , and in 1874 a retaliatory incursion to Taiwan was sent , which was a success . The success of this expedition emboldened the Japanese : not even the Americans could defeat the Taiwanese cannibals in the Formosa Expedition of 1867 . Very few gave it much thought at the time , but this was the first move in the Japanese expansionism series . Japan occupied Taiwan for the rest of 1874 and then left owing to Chinese pressures , but in 1879 it finally annexed the Ryukyu Islands . In 1875 Qing China sent a 300-men force to subdue the Taiwanese cannibals , but unlike the Japanese the Chinese were routed , ambushed and 250 of their men were killed ; the failure of this expedition exposed once more the failure of Qing China to exert effective control in Taiwan , and acted as another incentive for the Japanese to annex Taiwan .

		GOLD_MENTION=2015 MTV Video Music Awards
		CONTEXT=Music critics favorably reviewed " Never Catch Me " . Named Best New Track by '' Pitchfork Media '' , editor Jayson Greene praised Lamar 's performance , writing " his hyper-vaulting flow and embedded rhyme patterns within rhyme patterns " . For its year-end list of " The 100 Best Tracks of 2014 " , '' Pitchfork '' ranked the song at number 23 . Also commenting on Lamar , '' Billboard '' 's Chris Payne wrote , " There are n't many A-list rappers who could handle a beat like this , but Kendrick is clearly one of them . " '' Rolling Stone '' editor Jon Dolan gave the song three-and-a-half out of five stars , commenting " Over offhandedly lovely , warp-speed psychedelic soul-jazz , Lamar unleashes a word-mad waterfall with a worried emotional core ( " analyze my demise I say I 'm super-anxious " , he raps ) . " '' Consequence of Sound '' editor Nina Corcoran wrote : " when combined with one of Lamar ’s hottest verses to date ( before '' To Pimp a Butterfly '' ) , the song explodes . But it does n’t stop there . FlyLo shows off his talent by shifting gears post-Kendrick verse the only way you can : insane keys , double-time bass drum , and unrelenting hand claps . Eventually , it ’s all swallowed up in massive swelling synth and choral hums , fading to a beautiful , passionate outro . " Directed by Hiro Murai , the video begins at a funeral ( including attendees Flying Lotus and Thundercat in cameo roles ) . Seemingly a sad video , it turns instantly joyful when the two late children - a boy and a girl - bound out of their caskets at the front of the church and dance gleefully down the aisle . The mourners ca n't see the children as they dance right out of the church and out onto a blacktop , but a group of other kids chases after them as they hop in a hearse and drive away .

		GOLD_MENTION=VMAs
		CONTEXT=After the commercial lackluster of her eighth studio album , '' Britney Jean '' ( 2013 ) , Spears started her Las Vegas residency show , Britney : Piece of Me , which attained commercial success . Later , in September 2014 , Spears posted a picture of herself in the studio , hinting that she was recording new music . In another interview , a month later , she revealed that she was working " very slowly , but progressively " on the album . In 2015 , she released the song " Pretty Girls " with Iggy Azalea , however the song was met with moderate impact and Spears headed back to the studio to record more songs , but did n't have plans to release a new album . In November 2015 , Spears teased on her Instagram account that she was working with songwriters Justin Tranter and Julia Michaels , by posting a picture of them looking " bemused " with the caption : " Working hard and hardly working ... new album ... wheeeee ! . " A month later , Tranter gave an interview for website NewNowNext about his work with Spears and commented : " Working with Britney is a fucking dream . She is so sweet , so inspiring and a master on the mic . Me and Julia had to leave the studio one day because our screams of excitement after every take she did were distracting the producers . " In late 2016 , during interviews to promote the album , Spears declared that she wanted to explore new things on the record , and that it was her " most hip-hop album , " explaining : " ... there are like two or three songs that go in the direction of more urban that I 've wanted to do for a long time now , and I just have n't really done that . " In May 2016 , in an exclusive interview for website '' Breathe Heavy '' , Tranter revealed : " Nobody ever talks about Britney as a writer and she ’s f " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " was written by Mattias Larsson , Robin Fredriksson , Julia Michaels , Justin Tranter and Sandy Chila , with production being done by Mattman & Robin . Mattman & Robin were also responsible for programming , drums , percussion , snaps , handclaps , synths , guitars , bass and kalimba , while Michaels and Jermaine Jackson provided background vocals . It was recorded at 158 Studios , Westlake Village , California , The Studio at the Palms , Las Vegas , Nevada , and at Wolf Cousins Studios , Stockholm , Sweden . " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is an electropop , and dance-pop song that lasts for three minutes and twenty-two seconds ( 3:22 ) . It features " subtle keyboards , a strummed guitar , " and " wobbly bass " in its instrumentation . For Brian Josephs of '' Spin '' , the song 's guitar slaps " recall her 2001 single ' I 'm a Slave 4 U. ' " Other critics also felt that the " strummed flamenco guitar " on the song is similar to those on Justin Timberlake 's " Like I Love You " . Bianca Gracie of '' Fuse '' opined that the song reminded her of " the glory days ( no pun intended ) of ' Circus ' and ' Femme Fatale ' . " Lyrically , " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is a flirty song about Spears " offer ing several reasons why her lover should come over and options , which can be seen in the lines " Nobody should be alone if they do n't have to be " and " I could get into that kissin ' and touchin ' / Or we could be good and do next to nothin ' . " Amy Roberts of '' Bustle '' noted that the lyrics are about hooking up , adding that they " celebrate the idea that casual relationships do n't need to be lacking respect or understanding . You do n't have to be in love with , or committing to , the person that you 're hooking up with , but that also does n't mean that you ca n't connect with them on a different level than just sex . In fact , Spears makes it clear that it 's kind of even cool if her hook-up does n't want to have sex . Her partner can draw the boundaries of where the massage she 's offering starts and ends , and if it remains as nothing more than a back rub then so be it – that 's totally cool . " For Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine , the song features " some dubious lyrics that seem to suggest masturbatory self-love " in the lines : " All I want is what you want/And all you want is me . " The chorus of the song features " a shouted gang " of backup singers , singing : " Whatever you want / whatever you need / I 'll do it ! . " Lewis Corner of Digital Spy called it " a thumping pop anthem , " praising " Britney 's seductive vocal delivery . " Gil Kaufman of '' Billboard '' named it a " fun , flirty " track . Bianca Gracie of '' Fuse '' described it as a " pulsating track that is a flirty booty call that is bound to own the dance floor . " Robbie Daw of Idolator found it to be " a traditional Spears-style chunk of dance-pop " and " arguably the best yet , with its thick whomping bass and that sparkling ' nobody should be alone if they do n't have to be ' breakdown . " Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine called it " impeccably produced downstairs music , " adding that it " is an irresistible slice of dance-pop , with an ebullient bassline and staccato acoustic guitar . " Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic declared that " some of the highlights on the album are the silliest songs , " citing " Do You Wan na Come Over " 's " overheated flamenco chorus " as an example . Maura Johnston of '' Boston Globe '' said the song was one of the album 's high points , noting that the song " is jolted to life by the slashed guitars that helped make ' Toxic ' a pop thrill . " John Murphy of musicOMH was positive while noting that the track " has a rush and urgency about it which marks it out as one of the album 's best songs . " Nolan Feeney of '' Entertainment Weekly '' also picked it as a highlight , praising the " acoustic guitars and gurgling bass lines that make for one freaky pop experiment . " Alex Macpherson of '' The Guardian '' wrote that the song " takes the party back to Britney 's heyday , " praising the inclusion of the flamenco guitar . For '' Los Angeles Times '' writer Mikael Wood , the song " restore s some of the sonic invention that once defined Spears ' biggest hits . " Nick Levine , writing for '' NME '' , echoed the same thought , writing : " The lusty strut of ‘ Do You Wan na Come Over ? ’ nods to her early-noughties Neptunes-produced hits . " In his Vice column , Robert Christgau selected " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " and " Clumsy " as his favorite tracks on the album . Amy Mackelden of '' Bustle '' elaborated about the track : With a strong '90s vibe , an upbeat tempo , and a surprising rhythm , " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " utilizes the best of Spears ' talents . ... " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " embraces the current trend for songs that are musically complicated , that layer up their beats and sound effects , and feature multiple voices and infectious shouting during their choruses . Much like Hailee Steinfeld and Gwen Stefani 's latest offerings , " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is melodic , has a fast tempo , and is instantly recognizable . And most importantly , it 's fun . On August 18 , 2016 , Spears added " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " , as well as " Make Me ... " , to the setlist of her Las Vegas residency show Britney : Piece of Me . Later , on September 1 , 2016 , a performance of the song was broadcast from Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas for Today . During the performance , she used " an outfit similar to her risqué costume from 2016 's VMAs , while her backup dancers stood out in brightly-colored tank tops and shorts , " as reported by '' Entertainment Weekly '' Ruth Kinane . The song was also included in Spears 's setlist for the iHeartRadio Music Festival on September 24 , 2016 . Spears also performed it at I Heart Radio Jingle Ball , Triple Show and B26 Pepsi Jingle Bash during December 2016 . Also performed it at Apple Music Festival which was held in United Kingdom

As she performed , her blond hair blowing in the wind , and backed by six dancers wearing similar shimmering tuxes , Beyoncé gave new meaning to the lyrics : " Now everybody asks me why I 'm smiling out from ear to ear . " She kept her dancing to a minimum for most of the song as she held onto the microphone stand while singing " Love on Top " . Eventually making her way to the extended lip in front of the stage and throwing down , she encouraged the audience to put their hands together . Beyoncé ended the performance by dropping the microphone , opening her jacket , rubbing her belly , and thus announcing her pregnancy to the world

		CONTEXT=Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny appears at his back door in his boxers and invites viewers for a look around his house ; including a ( now fully dressed ) encounter with his karaoke machine . He then sets off on his bicycle for an interview at RTÉ . Alas his attempts to get there unscathed come undone when his bike receives a puncture and he has to resort to queueing for a bus like the common person . When the bus arrives , he realises he has no money but after asking for some spare cash from an innocent bystander , he turns around to find the bus has pulled off again . In the RTÉ carpark , Pat Kenny sits in his car , casting his eyes over his fellow broadcasters and enviously longing to join them in their casual conversation . When he finally plucks up the courage to approach Marian Finucane and Joe Duffy , the latter is overheard insulting him and Pat heads back to his car . With Pat due on air in ten minutes , Tom decides to join him in the passenger seat but he must first overcome the clutches of George Hook , who once again attempts to lure him to Newstalk . Pat asks Tom what the world really thinks of him , believing that his assistant is the only person in the world who is loyal to him . Tom attempts to avoid the question , distracting Pat by ( wrongly ) telling him that Enda Kenny has just arrived . Eventually Tom opts to tell Pat , albeit with much hesitation , that he is '' " absolutely unbelievable " '' . At that moment Enda Kenny finally arrives at the studio , still in his biker gear and collapses with exhaustion on the steps having raced through Dublin to make the interview on schedule . Kenny and Kenny square off on air and , with Pat faced with an adversary so similar in perceived personality , popularity and name he is even more unable to cope with his feelings of unworthiness than usual . Pat breaks down live on air , mistaking Enda 's rival , Taoiseach Bertie Ahern , for his own rival , '' Liveline '' presenter Joe Duffy . This prompts Enda to join him in his moment of unrelenting emotion . The next morning Tom arrives at Pat 's house . Pat assumes he has come with his P45 or details of who is to take over the mantle of the station 's highest earning broadcaster . However Tom merely points to two giant sacks of complimentary mail he has carried on his bike from RTÉ headquarters . One of them even wants to sleep with the presenter , who quickly places the letter in the left front pocket of his dressing gown . Pat is astounded to discover he is all over the news and that celebrities such as 1992 Eurovision Song Contest winner Linda Martin , music mogul Louis Walsh and Boyzone lead singer Ronan Keating are talking about him . He hurries indoors to switch on his television . There he finds that figures from the worlds of sport and politics including Irish national football team manager Steve Staunton , Ireland rugby manager Eddie O'Sullivan and Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams are lining up in their droves to pay tribute to him . He is intrigued to find Fintan O'Toole has also spoken greatly of him but becomes irritated when he finds that Steve Staunton seems to have taken over the airwaves , typically reiterating how Pat has done a great job , how he works for the team , has delivered a great result and what else can you say . Meanwhile , Bertie Ahern repeatedly rings Tom 's mobile to request an interview with Pat , but on each occasion Tom tells him to ring back later . Pat and Tom stroll into RTÉ , where George Hook is astounded to hear of Pat 's newfound popularity . He is adamant that Tom will soon join him at Newstalk but Tom shows his unswaying loyalty by declaring he will go only where Pat goes . On Friday night George slips into RTÉ and just as an episode of '' The Late Late Show '' is coming to a close , approaches Pat 's dressing room . George is inadvertently knocked to the floor by a stray microphone where he lies moaning until Pat emerges from the dressing room . Pat steps over George and leaves RTÉ with Tom , telling his assistant that he should not allow anyone to undermine him before demanding that he open the door

It was also – in terms of the actual awards – among the most disappointing . " '' Vanity Fair '' s , Richard Lawson wrote , " As a host , Kimmel struck a careful , appropriately measured tone ... All told , Sunday 's ceremony did an admirable job of recognizing all the turmoil surrounding it while maintaining the silly , chintzy trappings that so many of us tune into the Oscars for . " CNN 's Brian Lowry quipped , " The Oscars are a big , unwieldy beast , which invariably try to serve too many masters . Yet if the intent was ultimately to maintain a celebratory tone without ignoring either the outside world or the elephant in the room throughout this year 's awards , host Jimmy Kimmel and the show itself largely succeeded . " Others were more critical of the show . Television critic Maureen Ryan of '' Variety '' said , " All things considered , the show had a more or less low-key vibe . Normally it takes about two hours for the numbing effect to set in , but despite host Jimmy Kimmel 's best efforts , Sunday 's telecast started to feel a bit languid and low-energy far earlier . " Television critic James Poniewozik of '' The New York Times '' said , " despite the recent upheaval in Hollywood , the ceremony at large still focused mainly on celebration and glitter literally , in the case of the blinding set , which looked as if the ceremony were encased in an enormous geode . There 's also the perennial problem of bloat . The hitch , of course , is that every part of the show has its constituency . " Darren Franich of '' Entertainment Weekly '' wrote , " What fun we had at this year 's Oscars ! Long show , sure , but where to cut it ? " Writing for '' Deadline '' Greg Evans said , " Did the nearly four-hour running time contain any moments for the Oscar ages ? Probably not . " David Wiegand of the '' San Francisco Chronicle '' wrote , " Even the hope that the noise of clapping might keep the audience at home and in the theater awake , there was little of that for anything except the entrance of actors of advance age . " '' The Oregonian '' columnist Kristi Turnquist wrote , " Was it respectful ? Absolutely . Did it make for kind of a dull , earnest Oscars show ? Yeah , kind of . " Attaining 26.5 million U.S. viewers according to Nielsen ratings , the ceremony 's telecast had a 16-percent drop in viewership from last year 's ceremony and had the lowest U.S. viewership in Oscar history . On March 6 , after the final ratings were confirmed , President Donald Trump took to his Twitter account , saying , " Lowest rated Oscars in HISTORY . Problem is , we do n't have stars anymore – except your President ( just kidding , of course ) ! " . In response , Kimmel also tweeted , saying , " Thanks , lowest rated President in HISTORY . " In July 2018 , the ceremony presentation received eight nominations for the 70th Primetime Creative Arts Emmys

		CONTEXT=After the commercial lackluster of her eighth studio album , '' Britney Jean '' ( 2013 ) , Spears started her Las Vegas residency show , Britney : Piece of Me , which attained commercial success . Later , in September 2014 , Spears posted a picture of herself in the studio , hinting that she was recording new music . In another interview , a month later , she revealed that she was working " very slowly , but progressively " on the album . In 2015 , she released the song " Pretty Girls " with Iggy Azalea , however the song was met with moderate impact and Spears headed back to the studio to record more songs , but did n't have plans to release a new album . In November 2015 , Spears teased on her Instagram account that she was working with songwriters Justin Tranter and Julia Michaels , by posting a picture of them looking " bemused " with the caption : " Working hard and hardly working ... new album ... wheeeee ! . " A month later , Tranter gave an interview for website NewNowNext about his work with Spears and commented : " Working with Britney is a fucking dream . She is so sweet , so inspiring and a master on the mic . Me and Julia had to leave the studio one day because our screams of excitement after every take she did were distracting the producers . " In late 2016 , during interviews to promote the album , Spears declared that she wanted to explore new things on the record , and that it was her " most hip-hop album , " explaining : " ... there are like two or three songs that go in the direction of more urban that I 've wanted to do for a long time now , and I just have n't really done that . " In May 2016 , in an exclusive interview for website '' Breathe Heavy '' , Tranter revealed : " Nobody ever talks about Britney as a writer and she ’s f " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " was written by Mattias Larsson , Robin Fredriksson , Julia Michaels , Justin Tranter and Sandy Chila , with production being done by Mattman & Robin . Mattman & Robin were also responsible for programming , drums , percussion , snaps , handclaps , synths , guitars , bass and kalimba , while Michaels and Jermaine Jackson provided background vocals . It was recorded at 158 Studios , Westlake Village , California , The Studio at the Palms , Las Vegas , Nevada , and at Wolf Cousins Studios , Stockholm , Sweden . " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is an electropop , and dance-pop song that lasts for three minutes and twenty-two seconds ( 3:22 ) . It features " subtle keyboards , a strummed guitar , " and " wobbly bass " in its instrumentation . For Brian Josephs of '' Spin '' , the song 's guitar slaps " recall her 2001 single ' I 'm a Slave 4 U. ' " Other critics also felt that the " strummed flamenco guitar " on the song is similar to those on Justin Timberlake 's " Like I Love You " . Bianca Gracie of '' Fuse '' opined that the song reminded her of " the glory days ( no pun intended ) of ' Circus ' and ' Femme Fatale ' . " Lyrically , " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is a flirty song about Spears " offer ing several reasons why her lover should come over and options , which can be seen in the lines " Nobody should be alone if they do n't have to be " and " I could get into that kissin ' and touchin ' / Or we could be good and do next to nothin ' . " Amy Roberts of '' Bustle '' noted that the lyrics are about hooking up , adding that they " celebrate the idea that casual relationships do n't need to be lacking respect or understanding . You do n't have to be in love with , or committing to , the person that you 're hooking up with , but that also does n't mean that you ca n't connect with them on a different level than just sex . In fact , Spears makes it clear that it 's kind of even cool if her hook-up does n't want to have sex . Her partner can draw the boundaries of where the massage she 's offering starts and ends , and if it remains as nothing more than a back rub then so be it – that 's totally cool . " For Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine , the song features " some dubious lyrics that seem to suggest masturbatory self-love " in the lines : " All I want is what you want/And all you want is me . " The chorus of the song features " a shouted gang " of backup singers , singing : " Whatever you want / whatever you need / I 'll do it ! . " Lewis Corner of Digital Spy called it " a thumping pop anthem , " praising " Britney 's seductive vocal delivery . " Gil Kaufman of '' Billboard '' named it a " fun , flirty " track . Bianca Gracie of '' Fuse '' described it as a " pulsating track that is a flirty booty call that is bound to own the dance floor . " Robbie Daw of Idolator found it to be " a traditional Spears-style chunk of dance-pop " and " arguably the best yet , with its thick whomping bass and that sparkling ' nobody should be alone if they do n't have to be ' breakdown . " Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine called it " impeccably produced downstairs music , " adding that it " is an irresistible slice of dance-pop , with an ebullient bassline and staccato acoustic guitar . " Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic declared that " some of the highlights on the album are the silliest songs , " citing " Do You Wan na Come Over " 's " overheated flamenco chorus " as an example . Maura Johnston of '' Boston Globe '' said the song was one of the album 's high points , noting that the song " is jolted to life by the slashed guitars that helped make ' Toxic ' a pop thrill . " John Murphy of musicOMH was positive while noting that the track " has a rush and urgency about it which marks it out as one of the album 's best songs . " Nolan Feeney of '' Entertainment Weekly '' also picked it as a highlight , praising the " acoustic guitars and gurgling bass lines that make for one freaky pop experiment . " Alex Macpherson of '' The Guardian '' wrote that the song " takes the party back to Britney 's heyday , " praising the inclusion of the flamenco guitar . For '' Los Angeles Times '' writer Mikael Wood , the song " restore s some of the sonic invention that once defined Spears ' biggest hits . " Nick Levine , writing for '' NME '' , echoed the same thought , writing : " The lusty strut of ‘ Do You Wan na Come Over ? ’ nods to her early-noughties Neptunes-produced hits . " In his Vice column , Robert Christgau selected " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " and " Clumsy " as his favorite tracks on the album . Amy Mackelden of '' Bustle '' elaborated about the track : With a strong '90s vibe , an upbeat tempo , and a surprising rhythm , " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " utilizes the best of Spears ' talents . ... " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " embraces the current trend for songs that are musically complicated , that layer up their beats and sound effects , and feature multiple voices and infectious shouting during their choruses . Much like Hailee Steinfeld and Gwen Stefani 's latest offerings , " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is melodic , has a fast tempo , and is instantly recognizable . And most importantly , it 's fun . On August 18 , 2016 , Spears added " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " , as well as " Make Me ... " , to the setlist of her Las Vegas residency show Britney : Piece of Me . Later , on September 1 , 2016 , a performance of the song was broadcast from Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas for Today . During the performance , she used " an outfit similar to her risqué costume from 2016 's VMAs , while her backup dancers stood out in brightly-colored tank tops and shorts , " as reported by '' Entertainment Weekly '' Ruth Kinane . The song was also included in Spears 's setlist for the iHeartRadio Music Festival on September 24 , 2016 . Spears also performed it at I Heart Radio Jingle Ball , Triple Show and B26 Pepsi Jingle Bash during December 2016 . Also performed it at Apple Music Festival which was held in United Kingdom

		GOLD_MENTION=2011 MTV Video Music Awards
		CONTEXT=Lyrically , " Roman 's Revenge " has been described as " unrelenting " , " bonkers " , " angry " and " outrageous " . Critics found Minaj 's lyrics as intense and incisive , but Eminem 's rap has been noted as being similar to his earlier work and contains misogyny and homophobia . Many critics questioned Minaj 's alter-ego , Roman Zolanski , as being an " angry gay male " because it was expected that the rappers would go toe-to-toe in-between verses . The song makes references to Disney 's Princess Jasmine and Aladdin , iPods , and New York Giant Eli Manning as well as the song " Scenario " by A Tribe Called Quest , the latter of which is referenced through the line " Rawr , rawr like a dungeon dragon " which is taken from Busta Rhymes ' verse in " Scenario . " David Jeffries of '' AllMusic '' called the song the key track of the album , referring to Minaj as a savage as she " roars like a tiger " while standing up to Eminem . Brad Wete of '' Entertainment Weekly '' called the song " merciless " , as Nicki/Roman tears into the song with lyrics firing at whoever they are meant to be fired at . Alexis Petridis of '' The Guardian '' praised the song 's eerie and vulgar tone , referring to Minaj 's tone of voice as " thrilling , quivering & edge-of-panic . " Margaret Wappler of '' Los Angeles Times '' complemented Minaj 's " huffing and puffing " at Eminem 's alter-ego , while both characters exchange violent lyrics . Praising the song as the main track of the album , Scott Plagenhoef of '' Pitchfork Media '' complimented the song as aggressive and pointed out Eminem 's use of " recycling his Shady-circa-99 persona . " Jesse Cataldo of '' Slant '' dissected the track while attempting to understand Roman Zolanski as a " less carefully identified sliver of herself than the embodiment of what makes her appealing . " Cataldo additionally added that the song gets " violently up in your face . " However , other critics dismissed and negatively reviewed the anti-gay slurs rapped by guest-feature Eminem . '' Idolator '' positively reviewed the song as an " experiment , " while praising the verses of Minaj while dismissing Eminem 's " typical misogyny and homophobia . " Marc Hogan of '' Spin '' praised the song for noting Minaj 's capabilities to " compete with the big boys " in rap . He noted that Eminem and Minaj trade verses over " pulsating Swizz Beatz strings " . Although Eminem makes a " killer blow " with an anti-gay slur on gay-friendly Minaj 's track " , Minaj retaliates with " outlandish British accent . " Zach Baron and Rich Juzwiak of '' The Village Voice '' both debated on the track , praising it as well as dismissing the anti-gay lyrics by Eminem . Zach Baron praised Minaj for upstaging Eminem by stating that the guest-feature deserved to be shown up by Minaj as she additionally add 's more character into the song with additional voice-changes . Rich Juzwiak approached the song as the gay-male-alter-ego Roman Zolanski verses the anti-gay Slim Shady , and praised Minaj/Zolanski for " winning the battle . " Juzwiak later questioned Minaj 's alter-ego Roman as an " angry gay-male , " stating that Roman 's character should have gone ahead with knocking Eminem for his past " anti-gay-epithet , " and his ' piss-on-women misogyny . " Many critics considered the song a " diss " towards Lil ' Kim , who has been in disputes with Minaj since the beginning of her career . Mariel Concepcion of '' Billboard '' dissected the song stating " Nicki Minaj 's highly-talked about " Roman 's Revenge " track hit the net over the weekend , and the Harajuku Barbie appears to be taking jabs at Lil ' Kim . " In the first verse Minaj takes shots saying " '' Look at my show footage how these girls be spazzing/So fuck I look like getting back to a has-been/Yeah I said it has-been/hang it up/flatscreen '' " then again " '' You out of work/I know it 's tough/but enough is enough '' / " Minaj then specifically takes jabs at Baltimore rapper Keys and Lil ' Kim in the second verse rapping , " '' Is this the thanks that I get for putting you bitches on / is it my fault that all of you bitches gone '' / " and following this line this inferred she was talking about Lil ' Kim " '' Nicki she just mad cause you took the spot / word that bitch mad cause I took the spot / Well bitch if you aint shitting then get off the pot/Got some niggas out in Brooklyn that 'll off ya top '' / . Minaj also subliminally took jabs at rapper Keys with " '' I see them dusty ass Filas , Levi 's / Raggedy Ann 's / Holes in your knee highs '' " . Lil ' Kim fired back at the song at a club-concert , stating " I will erase this bitch ’s social security number . First of all , I do n’t even need a record right now and I ’d kill that bitch with my old shit . My records ai n’t just enter the charts , they made history . What the fuck is this bullshit , this shit come and go ! " Minaj later stated in an interview on '' The Wendy Williams Show '' that , " They know what I 'm talking about . See that 's the thing when you put out records ; you know only the ' guilty ones ' feel like you 're talking about them . So you know , if you have nothing to worry about , if you have n't came out saying stuff , if you never came out saying your ungrateful bullshit then you would n't worry about it . " In response to " Roman 's Revenge " , Lil ' Kim released " Black Friday " which debuted on DJ Absolut ’s Hot 97 show on Thanksgiving Day . The song samples Pharoahe Monch ’s instrumental from “ Simon Says " and takes lyrical jabs at Minaj , stating " This ai n’t a championship fight , I been the greatest / See the fact is , what you doing , I did it / Lames tryna clone my style and run wit it / That ’s cool , I was the first one wit it / You ’s a Lil ’ Kim wannabe , you just hate to admit it . ” Minaj performed the song live during '' VH1 's Diva 's Support the Troops '' for the men and women of the military . The song was accompanied by other singles from the rapper 's debut album and " Girls Just Wan na Have Fun " with Katy Perry . After winning the MTV Video Music Award for Best Hip-Hop Video at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards , she said that " The new album is going to have a lot of Roman on it ... And if you 're not familiar with Roman , then you will be familiar with him very soon . He ’s the boy that lives inside of me . He 's a lunatic and he 's gay and he 'll be on there a lot .

		CONTEXT=Carefree Black Girls is a cultural concept and movement that aims to increase the breadth of “ alternative ” representations of black women . The origins of this expression can be traced to both Twitter and Tumblr . Zeba Blay was reportedly the first person to use the expression as a hashtag on Twitter in May 2013 . Danielle Hawkins soon launched a blog on Tumblr by the same name . In her article for The Root , Diamond Sharp describes " carefree black girls " as an idea that , “ [ black women ] have used to anchor expressions of individuality and whimsy in the face of the heavy stereotypes and painful realities that too often color discussions of their demographic . " At Refinery29 , Jamala Johns said it was " a way to celebrate all things joyous and eclectic among brown ladies . Cultivated online and driven by social media , it 's one telling piece of a much wider development of inspiration assembled by and for black women . " Hillary Crosley Coker , a reporter for Jezebel provides specific examples of notable black women embodying the concept . She claims that , " ladies like Chiara de Blasio ( with her hippie flower headband ) , Solange [ Knowles ] and her eclectic style and Janelle Monae 's futurism are their patron saints " .

		GOLD_MENTION=VMAs
		CONTEXT=After the commercial lackluster of her eighth studio album , '' Britney Jean '' ( 2013 ) , Spears started her Las Vegas residency show , Britney : Piece of Me , which attained commercial success . Later , in September 2014 , Spears posted a picture of herself in the studio , hinting that she was recording new music . In another interview , a month later , she revealed that she was working " very slowly , but progressively " on the album . In 2015 , she released the song " Pretty Girls " with Iggy Azalea , however the song was met with moderate impact and Spears headed back to the studio to record more songs , but did n't have plans to release a new album . In November 2015 , Spears teased on her Instagram account that she was working with songwriters Justin Tranter and Julia Michaels , by posting a picture of them looking " bemused " with the caption : " Working hard and hardly working ... new album ... wheeeee ! . " A month later , Tranter gave an interview for website NewNowNext about his work with Spears and commented : " Working with Britney is a fucking dream . She is so sweet , so inspiring and a master on the mic . Me and Julia had to leave the studio one day because our screams of excitement after every take she did were distracting the producers . " In late 2016 , during interviews to promote the album , Spears declared that she wanted to explore new things on the record , and that it was her " most hip-hop album , " explaining : " ... there are like two or three songs that go in the direction of more urban that I 've wanted to do for a long time now , and I just have n't really done that . " In May 2016 , in an exclusive interview for website '' Breathe Heavy '' , Tranter revealed : " Nobody ever talks about Britney as a writer and she ’s f " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " was written by Mattias Larsson , Robin Fredriksson , Julia Michaels , Justin Tranter and Sandy Chila , with production being done by Mattman & Robin . Mattman & Robin were also responsible for programming , drums , percussion , snaps , handclaps , synths , guitars , bass and kalimba , while Michaels and Jermaine Jackson provided background vocals . It was recorded at 158 Studios , Westlake Village , California , The Studio at the Palms , Las Vegas , Nevada , and at Wolf Cousins Studios , Stockholm , Sweden . " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is an electropop , and dance-pop song that lasts for three minutes and twenty-two seconds ( 3:22 ) . It features " subtle keyboards , a strummed guitar , " and " wobbly bass " in its instrumentation . For Brian Josephs of '' Spin '' , the song 's guitar slaps " recall her 2001 single ' I 'm a Slave 4 U. ' " Other critics also felt that the " strummed flamenco guitar " on the song is similar to those on Justin Timberlake 's " Like I Love You " . Bianca Gracie of '' Fuse '' opined that the song reminded her of " the glory days ( no pun intended ) of ' Circus ' and ' Femme Fatale ' . " Lyrically , " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is a flirty song about Spears " offer ing several reasons why her lover should come over and options , which can be seen in the lines " Nobody should be alone if they do n't have to be " and " I could get into that kissin ' and touchin ' / Or we could be good and do next to nothin ' . " Amy Roberts of '' Bustle '' noted that the lyrics are about hooking up , adding that they " celebrate the idea that casual relationships do n't need to be lacking respect or understanding . You do n't have to be in love with , or committing to , the person that you 're hooking up with , but that also does n't mean that you ca n't connect with them on a different level than just sex . In fact , Spears makes it clear that it 's kind of even cool if her hook-up does n't want to have sex . Her partner can draw the boundaries of where the massage she 's offering starts and ends , and if it remains as nothing more than a back rub then so be it – that 's totally cool . " For Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine , the song features " some dubious lyrics that seem to suggest masturbatory self-love " in the lines : " All I want is what you want/And all you want is me . " The chorus of the song features " a shouted gang " of backup singers , singing : " Whatever you want / whatever you need / I 'll do it ! . " Lewis Corner of Digital Spy called it " a thumping pop anthem , " praising " Britney 's seductive vocal delivery . " Gil Kaufman of '' Billboard '' named it a " fun , flirty " track . Bianca Gracie of '' Fuse '' described it as a " pulsating track that is a flirty booty call that is bound to own the dance floor . " Robbie Daw of Idolator found it to be " a traditional Spears-style chunk of dance-pop " and " arguably the best yet , with its thick whomping bass and that sparkling ' nobody should be alone if they do n't have to be ' breakdown . " Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine called it " impeccably produced downstairs music , " adding that it " is an irresistible slice of dance-pop , with an ebullient bassline and staccato acoustic guitar . " Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic declared that " some of the highlights on the album are the silliest songs , " citing " Do You Wan na Come Over " 's " overheated flamenco chorus " as an example . Maura Johnston of '' Boston Globe '' said the song was one of the album 's high points , noting that the song " is jolted to life by the slashed guitars that helped make ' Toxic ' a pop thrill . " John Murphy of musicOMH was positive while noting that the track " has a rush and urgency about it which marks it out as one of the album 's best songs . " Nolan Feeney of '' Entertainment Weekly '' also picked it as a highlight , praising the " acoustic guitars and gurgling bass lines that make for one freaky pop experiment . " Alex Macpherson of '' The Guardian '' wrote that the song " takes the party back to Britney 's heyday , " praising the inclusion of the flamenco guitar . For '' Los Angeles Times '' writer Mikael Wood , the song " restore s some of the sonic invention that once defined Spears ' biggest hits . " Nick Levine , writing for '' NME '' , echoed the same thought , writing : " The lusty strut of ‘ Do You Wan na Come Over ? ’ nods to her early-noughties Neptunes-produced hits . " In his Vice column , Robert Christgau selected " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " and " Clumsy " as his favorite tracks on the album . Amy Mackelden of '' Bustle '' elaborated about the track : With a strong '90s vibe , an upbeat tempo , and a surprising rhythm , " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " utilizes the best of Spears ' talents . ... " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " embraces the current trend for songs that are musically complicated , that layer up their beats and sound effects , and feature multiple voices and infectious shouting during their choruses . Much like Hailee Steinfeld and Gwen Stefani 's latest offerings , " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is melodic , has a fast tempo , and is instantly recognizable . And most importantly , it 's fun . On August 18 , 2016 , Spears added " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " , as well as " Make Me ... " , to the setlist of her Las Vegas residency show Britney : Piece of Me . Later , on September 1 , 2016 , a performance of the song was broadcast from Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas for Today . During the performance , she used " an outfit similar to her risqué costume from 2016 's VMAs , while her backup dancers stood out in brightly-colored tank tops and shorts , " as reported by '' Entertainment Weekly '' Ruth Kinane . The song was also included in Spears 's setlist for the iHeartRadio Music Festival on September 24 , 2016 . Spears also performed it at I Heart Radio Jingle Ball , Triple Show and B26 Pepsi Jingle Bash during December 2016 . Also performed it at Apple Music Festival which was held in United Kingdom

Her voice has more need than vulnerability , more anger than understanding . " Christopher R. Weingarten of '' Rolling Stone '' also gave a negative review , stating , " This album of insta-dated EDM-pop anthems and half-cocked bass drops probably wo n't help Michele 's cause . The songs about love 's ups and downs have a few memorable lyrics ( ' My heart 's too drunk to drive ' ) but not nearly enough . " '' Louder '' was nominated for World 's Best Album at the 2014 World Music Awards , held in Monaco on May 27 , 2014

The ceremony 's unusual date — a Monday night in late August — was due to two factors , primary being NBC 's commitment to '' Sunday Night Football '' ; since acquiring the National Football League 's Sunday night game package in 2006 , NBC , when it is their turn in the four-network rotation to air the Primetime Emmy Awards , usually schedules the ceremony for the Sunday before Labor Day weekend , to avoid conflicts with '' SNF '' in mid-September ( when ABC , CBS , or Fox normally air the ceremony ) . NBC 's ideal date on the 2014 calendar for the ceremony ( Sunday , August 24 ) led to the other scheduling factor — MTV 's Video Music Awards , which were set for that night more than a year in advance ( and would be staged in the L.A. area as well , at The Forum in Inglewood ) . On January 28 , 2014 , rather than go head-to-head with the VMA 's , NBC announced that the ceremony would take place on Monday , August 25 . The move would allow NBC to commit to a preseason '' Sunday Night Football '' broadcast for the 24th ( a game between the Cincinnati Bengals and Arizona Cardinals ) ; it also ensured the tradition of staging the Primetime Emmy Awards the weekend after the Creative Arts Emmy Awards ( that ceremony was already set for August 16 )

		CONTEXT=The show received a negative reception from most media publications . Associated Press television critic Frazier Moore lamented that Crystal " seemed incredibly listless " . He also questioned the purpose of the " Year of the Woman " theme writing , " The Oscar show itself seemed at odds with its own feminist theme . " Robert Bianco from the '' Pittsburgh Post-Gazette '' derided Allen 's musical production numbers , comparing them to the disastrous opening number at the 61st ceremony held in 1989 . Columnist Matt Roush of '' USA Today '' complained , " Crystal , in a by-now-familiar performance , has , in four years , taken a plum assignment and , by repetition , reduced it to shtick . " He also wrote that , " The song medley is getting old hat , " and the " smug references to his flop '' Mr. Saturday Night '' were out of an improv amateur night . " The telecast also received unfavorable reaction from various public feminist figures . In an interview with '' Los Angeles Daily News '' author and activist Betty Friedan condemned the " Year of the Woman " theme commenting , " It had no basis in reality . On behalf of women directors , cinematographer , and producers , I resent the travesty of calling that a tribute . " Likewise , President of the National Organization for Women 's Los Angeles chapter Tammy Bruce chastised ceremony 's feminist tribute as " one of the most hypocritical , patronizing things I saw in my whole life . " In response , Gil Cates responded towards the criticism of the theme stating , " The theme developed and raised consciousness in a way that I think is positive , not only for the individual in general but for individual women specifically . " He also quoted an ancient Chinese proverb later made famous by former U.S. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt saying , " It is better to light one candle than to curse the darkness " Despite the adverse reception , the ABC broadcast drew in an average of 45.7 million people over its length , which was a 3 % increase from the previous year 's ceremony . The show also drew higher Nielsen ratings compared to the previous ceremony with 31.2 % of households watching over a 51 share . It also drew a higher 18 – 49 demo rating with a 20.1 rating among viewers in that demographic

The ceremony 's unusual date — a Monday night in late August — was due to two factors , primary being NBC 's commitment to '' Sunday Night Football '' ; since acquiring the National Football League 's Sunday night game package in 2006 , NBC , when it is their turn in the four-network rotation to air the Primetime Emmy Awards , usually schedules the ceremony for the Sunday before Labor Day weekend , to avoid conflicts with '' SNF '' in mid-September ( when ABC , CBS , or Fox normally air the ceremony ) . NBC 's ideal date on the 2014 calendar for the ceremony ( Sunday , August 24 ) led to the other scheduling factor — MTV 's Video Music Awards , which were set for that night more than a year in advance ( and would be staged in the L.A. area as well , at The Forum in Inglewood ) . On January 28 , 2014 , rather than go head-to-head with the VMA 's , NBC announced that the ceremony would take place on Monday , August 25 . The move would allow NBC to commit to a preseason '' Sunday Night Football '' broadcast for the 24th ( a game between the Cincinnati Bengals and Arizona Cardinals ) ; it also ensured the tradition of staging the Primetime Emmy Awards the weekend after the Creative Arts Emmy Awards ( that ceremony was already set for August 16 )

		CONTEXT=The title of the track was originally " Sanctified Pussy " , a phrase which Gaye can be heard mumbling ( appearing somewhat unedited ) during certain parts of the updated chorus provided by The Waters , chants of '' " sanctified lady " '' . Along with Masochistic Beauty , the song was an outtake from the '' Midnight Love '' sessions , that remained unfinished due to the singer 's death in 1984 at the age of 44 . Despite being incomplete and omitted from the album , the song was planned and expected by the singer to become his next big record and follow-up to ' " Sexual Healing . " The lyrics explore the singer 's longing to find " that one woman who is untainted and incorruptible . " Regarding the earlier receptions of the song and its title , Gaye once stated to ex-wife Janis that " Some say the song is beneath me . And yes , there is humor implicit in the title .

I need a woman as flawless as my own mother . ” Years later , guitarist and longtime collaborator Gordon Banks ( Gaye 's brother-in-law ) helped to finish the track by adding a choir and an electronic beat throughout the song , plus a vocodered chant of the title at the beginning

Michelle Leonard and Alex Christensen , who was already a member of the jury , joined the judge panel . The castings through big cities ran for 4 episodes . The contestants took a seat in a big hall and had to step forward to the judges in groups of 4 ( 2 +2 if they apply as duos ) and sing one song in front of them . They learn from the judges decision directly after their performance . One day later , the winners of the first day prepared two songs and got to the judges alone ( or as a duo ) and perform both songs without forgetting any lines of the lyrics .

In 1937 , her letters to her lover , Italian General , airship pioneer and Arctic explorer Umberto Nobile , indicated that she was in Frankfurt for an extended period , and then in 1938 , she spent time in Basel and Geneva before returning to Frankfurt . Hitler 's first meeting with Mussolini took place in Rome in May 1938 , but Speier was not back in Rome until July . Then in September , she was in the Tuscan town of Chianciano Terme . Pope Pius XI died on 10 February , 1939 and Speier converted to Catholicism later that year with Pope Pius XII immediately renewing her employment . Although she was intensely occupied with her work at the Vatican , she often considered emigrating to the United States , where her mother and sister lived , or to Brazil . During this early period of his papacy , Pius XII granted 3,000 visas to Jews , if they had been baptized , to emigrate to Brazil , though the only evidence found linking Speier and Pius XII at this time was , in her correspondence , his congratulatory telegram on her conversion . Throughout 1939 and 1940 , Nobile was in the United States and Speier remained in Rome until the summer of 1940 , when she took a retreat to Chianciano . After 1940 , correspondence between the two was sparse as they feared censors and writing had become increasingly impractical . Nobile returned to Rome in May 1942 and her family severed communication with Speier after learning of her Catholic baptism , effectively ending her reasons for emigration . During the German occupation of Rome 1943/1944 Pope Pius XII made arrangements for Giulio Belvederi , nephew of the former Pontifical Master of Ceremonies Pietro Respighi , to hide Speier in the Catacombs of St. Priscilla , under the nunnery . Hiding in the catacombs saved Speier from the Raid of the Ghetto of Rome on 16 October 1943 in which more than 1,000 Jews were deported to Auschwitz and all save 16 were killed . During this part of the war , the Museum was closed , until the end of September 1944 , and many artworks from war-torn areas were shipped to the Vatican for storage . When it reopened , she continued with her work creating a detailed monuments inventory of the Vatican holdings , which resulted in several important finds . In 1946 , in an antiquities storage facility , she found a horse head sculpted by Phidias which was originally from one of the pediments of the Parthenon . On further examination , it was established from its weathering that it was in fact the second horse of Athena 's chariot on the western gable , where the dispute between Athena and Poseidon over the land of Attica is depicted . Speier also discovered the two so-called ancient Aurai statues that decorated the exterior of the Sala Rotonda when it was built in the 18th century . She published '' Die Skulpturen des Vaticanischen Museums '' ( The Sculptures of the Vatican Museums ) in 1956 about the find of the Parthenon horse 's head , and earlier in 1950 had published a distinguished report concerning the excavations of St. Peter 's Basilica in Herbig 's '' Vermächtnis der Antiken Kunst '' ( Legacy of Ancient Art ) entitled " Die neuen Ausgrabungen unter der Peterskirche in Rom "

		CONTEXT=The region had already experienced several large earthquakes , the very large 1855 Wairarapa Earthquake , and the 1934 Pahiatua earthquake in the Northern Wairarapa . The 1855 earthquake occurred on the Wairarapa Fault which is part of the North Island Fault System . At 11.16 pm a small and sharp but brief earthquake of magnitude 7.2 Ms ( Mw 6.9-7.2 ) shook a wide area in the lower North Island from Eketahuna to Masterton , Featherston and Wellington ; and was noticed from Auckland to near Dunedin . The main earthquake was of 7.2 Ms and the epicentre was near Masterton and 12 km deep . The quake lasted for over a minute and had been preceded by a foreshock three hours earlier at 8.15 pm . Many buildings in Masterton were damaged . The mayor Thomas Jordan declared a state of emergency and got troops to patrol the town . There was considerable damage in Palmerston North . In Wellington twenty thousand chimneys fell , and there was one death in the suburb of Kelburn when a 70-year old retired chemist Hedley Victor Evens ( sic ) was killed by coal gas from a fractured pipe . Some downtown pediments were damaged , but some had already been removed after the 1931 Hawke 's Bay earthquake . The city engineer K. E . Luke held that damage was less severe as the quake ended swiftly . Another shock in the area struck on 2nd August at 12.34 am , preceded by a foreshock on the late afternoon of the 1st . This was of magnitude 7.0 Ms ( Mw 6.8 ) or slightly less than the earlier quake . The epicentre was 40 km deep and at location 41.01 ° S and 175.52 ° E. Wairarapa except for Eketahuna did not suffer as badly , though in Masterton the June damage was exacerbated . The 2 August aftershock was followed by a third severe aftershock on 2 December , with about 600 aftershocks recorded to the end of the year . Repairs from the first quake were not completed , and the mortar for some repairs had not properly set . Some buildings weakened in June suffered further damage , though it was sometimes hard to tell if further damage had occurred . In Masterton many buildings were badly damaged by the first quake ; the fire station , the Bank of New Zealand , several shops and St Matthews Church ( which was later blown up by the Army ) . The Waiohine road bridge was badly sunken and was closed . After the second quake the Wairarapa Farmers Co-op building partly collapsed . In Wellington the first quake toppled some twenty thousand chimneys . In August there was serious damage in the Willis Street – Manners Street area to three buildings : Charles Begg 's music shop , the Duke of Edinburgh Hotel , and the Regent Hotel

		CONTEXT=The pattern of displacement along the Imperial Fault was very similar to that observed for the northern part of the rupture during the 1940 El Centro earthquake , although on this occasion the rupture did not extend across the border into Mexico . This had been explained as the behavior of individual slip patches along the Imperial Fault with two patches rupturing in 1940 and only the northern one in 1979 . The faulting that gave rise to the earthquake has been modeled by comparing synthetic seismograms with near-source strong motion recordings .

		CONTEXT=Donen solidified his solo career and scored another hit with the musical '' Seven Brides for Seven Brothers '' ( 1954 ) . Based on a short story by Stephen Vincent Benét , the film 's music is by Saul Chaplin and Gene de Paul , with lyrics by Johnny Mercer and choreography by Michael Kidd . Jane Powell plays Milly , an 1850s frontierswoman who marries Adam ( Howard Keel ) only hours after meeting him . When she returns with Adam to his log cabin in the Oregon backwoods , Milly discovers that her husband 's six brothers are uncivilized and oafish . She makes it her mission to domesticate them and , upon Milly 's sarcastic suggestion , the brothers kidnap six women from a neighboring town to marry them . The film was shot in the new CinemaScope format and is remembered for its dance sequences , particularly the " barn raising scene " in which architecture and construction become acrobatic ballet steps . '' Seven Brides for Seven Brothers '' was one of the highest-grossing films of 1954 and appeared on many critics ' 10 Best Films lists . It was nominated for five Academy Awards , including Best Picture and Best Music ( Scoring of a Musical Picture ) , which it won . Its success was a surprise to MGM , which invested more money in two other musicals : '' Rose Marie '' and '' Brigadoon '' , starring Kelly . '' Seven Brides for Seven Brothers '' was more profitable than either of the other films , as well as '' On the Town '' and '' Singin ' in the Rain '' , and its success was a major turning point for Donen 's career . The film was later criticized by novelist Francine Prose , who described it as anti-woman , calling it " one of the most repulsive movies about men and women that has ever been made " and a musical about rape

Stalin ordered him to fabricate a story that Lev Kamenev , Grigory Zinoviev and other leaders of the opposition were responsible for the murder , but seems to have resisted , whereupon Stalin entrusted Nikolai Yezhov to do it instead . In 1935 , he was ordered by Yezhov to track down and liquidate " an undiscovered centre of Trotskyists " in Moscow , as a preparatory step for the great purge that Stalin was planning . When Yezhov took over as head of the NKVD , Agranov remained his First Deputy , and in December 1936 was appointed Head of the Chief Directorate of State Security , which seemingly meant that he was to be trusted to purge the NKVD of officers Yezhov did not trust .

		GOLD_MENTION=1999 shooting in the Armenian parliament
		CONTEXT=Kaputikyan was increasingly critical of the government of independent Armenia 's second president , Robert Kocharyan . On 14 April 2004 , she wrote an open letter titled " Kocharyan Must Go " ( « Քոչարյանը պետք է հեռանա » ) , where she called for his resignation and protested the violent crackdown on an opposition demonstration on 12/13 April , which left dozens injured . She also returned the Mesrop Mashtots Medal she had been awarded by Kocharyan in 1999 . Regarding the beating of the opposition politician Ashot Manucharyan , Kaputikyan stated : " Beating in Armenia has become the basic means of politics and the most influential part of state terror . All cases when force has been used should be viewed from this standpoint . " ArmeniaNow reported that she thus became " an opposition celebrity " . She also wrote that a responsible politician would have resigned after the 1999 shooting in the Armenian parliament when Prime Minister Vazgen Sargsyan and Parliament Speaker Karen Demirchyan were assassinated , among others . In response , Kocharyan stated that the Mesrop Mashtots Medal is not his medal , but that of the Republic of Armenia . He added that he regrets that is how Kaputikyan 's views the " essence of our state " and does not contribute to " our nation 's respect for education of the young generation . " Kaputikyan is among the most notable Armenian women in history . She became a classic of Armenian literature during her lifetime and her poems have been included in school literature programs . Kaputikyan is often referred to in Armenian circles as Ամենայն հայոց բանաստեղծուհի , which literally translates to " Poetess of All Armenians " and imitates the " Poet of All Armenians " title given to Hovhannes Tumanyan , which itself derives from the Catholicos of All Armenians , the head of the Armenian Church . She was " one of the best-known and widely quoted Soviet Armenian poets " . An Armenian government press release on her death described Kaputikyan as " one of the most outstanding Armenian poets of the 20th century " . '' Aravot '' reported in 2004 that she is the " last of her kind . " In 1989 journalist and political analyst Bohdan Nahaylo described Kaputikyan as one of the " highly respected non-Russian cultural figures " of the Soviet Union

On 14 April 2004 , she wrote an open letter titled " Kocharyan Must Go " ( « Քոչարյանը պետք է հեռանա » ) , where she called for his resignation and protested the violent crackdown on an opposition demonstration on 12/13 April , which left dozens injured . She also returned the Mesrop Mashtots Medal she had been awarded by Kocharyan in 1999 . Regarding the beating of the opposition politician Ashot Manucharyan , Kaputikyan stated : " Beating in Armenia has become the basic means of politics and the most influential part of state terror . All cases when force has been used should be viewed from this standpoint . " ArmeniaNow reported that she thus became " an opposition celebrity " . She also wrote that a responsible politician would have resigned after the 1999 shooting in the Armenian parliament when Prime Minister Vazgen Sargsyan and Parliament Speaker Karen Demirchyan were assassinated , among others . In response , Kocharyan stated that the Mesrop Mashtots Medal is not his medal , but that of the Republic of Armenia . He added that he regrets that is how Kaputikyan 's views the " essence of our state " and does not contribute to " our nation 's respect for education of the young generation . " Kaputikyan is among the most notable Armenian women in history . She became a classic of Armenian literature during her lifetime and her poems have been included in school literature programs . Kaputikyan is often referred to in Armenian circles as Ամենայն հայոց բանաստեղծուհի , which literally translates to " Poetess of All Armenians " and imitates the " Poet of All Armenians " title given to Hovhannes Tumanyan , which itself derives from the Catholicos of All Armenians , the head of the Armenian Church . She was " one of the best-known and widely quoted Soviet Armenian poets " . An Armenian government press release on her death described Kaputikyan as " one of the most outstanding Armenian poets of the 20th century " . '' Aravot '' reported in 2004 that she is the " last of her kind . " In 1989 journalist and political analyst Bohdan Nahaylo described Kaputikyan as one of the " highly respected non-Russian cultural figures " of the Soviet Union

		GOLD_MENTION=criminal trials of the 1930s
		CONTEXT=According to the ITAR-TASS news agency , the prosecution stated that Khabarov 's group planned to launch an operation codenamed “ Dawn ” to overthrow official authorities in the region . Many prominent figures in Russian politics expressed outrage about Khabarov 's imprisonment . Among them are individuals with diametrically opposed political views such as the presidential candidates Leonid Ivashov and Gennady Zyuganov , as well as other political figures , such as Andrey Illarionov , Andrey Savelyev , Maxim Shevchenko , Alexey Dymovsky , Maxim Kalashnikov , Irek Murtazin , Mikhail Delyagin , Ashot Egiazaryan , Aleksandr Kharchikov , Dmitry Puchkov , '' et al. '' They said that the accusations do not hold water , pointing to the ridiculousness of the collected “ evidence ” against Khabarov . Khabarov 's colleague , Col. Vladislav Zyomkovsky , said during an interview with '' PublicPost '' , that officially announced denunciation of a failed masterplan doesn ′ t stand up to critical examination , and if examined , the argument simply falls to the ground . In his opinion , a brilliant military strategist such as Khabarov , would never develop such an obvious plan . To refute the official version of the failed plot , Zyomkovsky cited one paragraph from Khabarov 's bill of indictment , which states that Khabarov and his alleged accomplices planned to switch off the entire region 's electrical grid , and thus create panic and civil disorder . In his opinion , this passage was copypasted from an indictment of the criminal trials of the 1930s , when such an event would really have spread chaos . But in the 2000s in Russia , electrical outages happened on a daily basis , were routine and a quite common occurrence

It 's almost like my first movie in a weird way , cause it 's my first movie in this world , which is a world I 've been trying to break into .

		ANSWER=R.D. Reid said : " I think this film is about the attempt to deal with a deep-rooted despair
		GOLD_MENTION=35th annual Toronto International Film Festival
		CONTEXT=Though it is never explicitly invoked , '' You Are Here '' is primarily about the Internet and the information society . At a festival question-and-answer session in Utrecht , Cockburn said the film comes from anxieties and feelings " that are very specifc to the current digital age " . In an interview with Adam Nayman , who notes that Cockburn 's previous short pieces carry a recurrent theme of technophobia , Cockburn said he wanted to make a movie that expressed anxiety about a world where mapping and archiving the world is more substantial than the world itself : " Photography or video is already one step removed from reality . The second step away from reality is : how is it stored , how is it findable ? There 's the world , there 's pictures of the world , and there 's this multitude of search engines that you can use . " In a similar vein , Cockburn , said the film is all about " location , or at least talking around the idea of location ... the non-specificity of place ... closely connected to the anxiety and uncertainty-of - selfhood that I hope is somewhere near the movie 's heart . " In an interview with John Semley , Cockburn acknowledges Jorge Luis Borges as an influence on '' You Are Here '' , in particular , " where he talks about imagining the path that someone travels in their life and how if you could see that path it might somehow form a shape " , that is , a trace " that no person will ever be able to know or see or understand . " That idea is structurally the heart of the movie , but it 's also key to the emotional resonance . All the characters are struggling to come to terms with the fact that they ca n't know the bigger picture of the universe they ’re living in . They ca n't know how they relate to the other pieces . They ca n’t see the traces they are leaving . Cockburn has related how , at the 35th annual Toronto International Film Festival , in response to someone asking the actors what they thought the movie was about , most of the actors having just seen it for the first time , R.D. Reid said : " I think this film is about the attempt to deal with a deep-rooted despair " , which surprised Cockburn , since they had not talked about it : " I was really gratified to hear him say that . I thought that is a very appropriate interpretation of the movie . " In the same exchange , Cockburn also noted : " A couple of people have written about it being hopeful , which I 'll accept . " In his interview with Cockburn , Adam Nayman argued that the film was hopeful " insofar as it urges the viewer to simply take stock of his and her reality and act accordingly , " to which Cockburn replied : " It 's gratifying to hear it positioned that way . " In a number of interviews , Cockburn has said that '' You Are Here '' is ultimately related to a period when he went through a paranoid-delusional breakdown : " everything I saw , read , and heard was some sort of message to me that needed to be decoded . " It was a period of " intense meaning-making ... I 'd be looking at any text I 'd encounter like a menu or road sign and I 'd scramble the letters around and see if there were any different codes there that needed to be deciphered . " After a long time , he realized that this behaviour , which was emotionally exhausting and troubling , had emotional underpinnings : " It became something that was n't just an enjoyable intellectual play . ... In a number of ways I worked through it , and part of that was figuring out what the emotional reasons were . " That experience " stayed " with him and worked its way into " just about everything " he wrote or directed : '' You Are Here '' is a compendium of characters dealing with the question of whether their life is just a series of random events , or whether there ’s some " Great Code " at the heart of it all . It 's a cerebral concept , but when you 're in the middle of it , it 's scary and exciting and sometimes even funny , and that , for me , is the heart of the movie . Cockburn 's literary influences for '' You Are Here '' include Paul Auster and especially Jorge Luis Borges . His film influences include the directors Todd Haynes ( '' Poison '' and '' I 'm Not There '' in particular ) , " for how he plays with film language with multiple styles in one movie , or the same character being played by multiple actors " , and Charlie Kaufman ( '' Synecdoche , New York '' ) , which " came out just as we were beginning to cut '' You Are Here '' " . The film was a Rosetta Stone of sorts , " in its willingness to seriously mess around with the supposed rules of filmmaking and storytelling , but ultimately being a comprehensible and moving experience that hits you on levels you did n’t even know you had .

		GOLD_MENTION=Sundance last January
		CONTEXT=On January 27 , 2011 the festival sent 9 filmmakers to 9 cities across the US to screen and discuss their films . The cities and films included : Bob Tourtellotte of Reuters wrote " Sundance 2011 has proven to be exceptionally strong , audiences and filmmakers seem to agree . " Tourtellotte reported that Robert Redford said that three years ago the Sundance Institute " set out to get back to its roots of supporting alternative voices in cinema and he felt like this year that strategy paid off . " Redford said " This year , what has excited me , is I think the quality is increasing in diversity and is increasing in depth . " The AP reported that Redford said it 's " always a relief " when the festival ends because " it 's really exhausting . " Kenneth Turan , film critic for the '' Los Angeles Times '' , wrote " though the festival has gotten ever bigger — and ( thankfully ) more efficient in moving its close to 50,000 attendees in and out of its far-flung theaters — it still retains the scrappy , antic spirit that has animated it from the start . " Turan wrote " One of the paradoxes of Sundance is that the quirkiness and charm around the edges of the festival are not always fully appreciated because so much of the media focus is on the premieres section and the U.S. dramatic competition " which he said " are , frankly , often the weakest parts of the festival . " Turan said " Sundance 's insistence on giving equal weight to documentaries and dramas has made it into as important a nonfiction showcase as any festival in the world ; witness the fact that four out of the five Oscar-nominated docs this year debuted at Sundance last January . " He also wrote that the foreign language film competition " is a strength at Sundance , and yet that field is given even less popular attention than the documentaries . " Peter Knegt wrote that this year 's festival " probably wo n't replicate last year 's Oscar record . " He said " Despite a huge surge in sales , this year 's Sundance slate looks like it might be the least Oscar-friendly in some time . " He noted that the U.S. Dramatic Grand Jury Prize winners have been nominated for Best Picture for two years ( referring to '' Precious '' and '' Winter 's Bone '' ) . Knegt speculated on films that might be nominated for the Oscars . Films he deemed " most likely to succeed " at being nominated included : '' Like Crazy '' for Best Picture , Michael Shannon of '' Take Shelter '' for Best Actor , Elizabeth Olsen of '' Martha Marcy May Marlene '' for Best Actress , Felicity Jones of '' Like Crazy '' for Best Actress , Jessica Chastain of '' Take Shelter '' for Best Supporting Actress , '' Project Nim '' for Best Documentary Feature , '' Page One '' for Best Documentary Feature , and '' The Interrupters '' for Best Documentary Feature . He wrote " It 's reasonable to feel assured that at least one of Sundance 's docs will end up an Oscar nominee , if not two , three or four . " Jada Yuan of '' New York '' magazine wrote " perhaps the biggest highlight of the festival is just how ripe it 's been for acquisitions , with nearly 30 films getting picked up , the most at any Sundance ever . " On " why everyone is suddenly so bullish on independent film " , Owen Gleiberman wrote that the " energy and optimism at Sundance this year was n't just hype . " He said the factors he thought were driving a new evolving vision of the indie film world included : " The deals have n’t gotten cheaper — they 've gotten smarter " , a belief that last year 's new festival director John Cooper and director of programming Trevor Groth " have re-energized the festival , heightening its quality and organizing the movies with a tempting new shape and vision " , video on demand gives distributors a safety net and more confidence , and the audiences for Sundance movies are not going away , saying " The Oscars ... have become a testament to the central place that Sundance movies now occupy . " Redford was happy about the success of the festival , with about 45 films being sold vs 14 in 2010 , an increase of about 220 % . Redford said studios are realizing " there are audiences " for indie films

It 's almost like my first movie in a weird way , cause it 's my first movie in this world , which is a world I 've been trying to break into . I 've wanted to be around filmmakers that are trying new things and not part of the system , so to speak , and they 're doing things on their own terms . " Winstead played the role of Mary Todd Lincoln opposite Benjamin Walker in '' Abraham Lincoln : Vampire Hunter '' . The film , also released in 2012 , received a mixed critical response while it flopped at the box office . Nevertheless , critics praised Winstead 's performance . The '' San Jose Mercury News '' called Winstead " a standout " , and the '' Illinois Times '' film critic wrote , " Winstead humanizes Mary Todd Lincoln by giving her a fiery wit and sense of resolve in the face of considerable adversity " . Winstead was commended for scenes opposite Benjamin Walker , with '' Little White Lies '' writing that they shared : " a sweet chemistry that gives their handful of scenes an endearing warmth "

		ANSWER=hopeful " insofar as it urges the viewer to simply take stock of his and her reality and act accordingly
		GOLD_MENTION=35th annual Toronto International Film Festival
		CONTEXT=Though it is never explicitly invoked , '' You Are Here '' is primarily about the Internet and the information society . At a festival question-and-answer session in Utrecht , Cockburn said the film comes from anxieties and feelings " that are very specifc to the current digital age " . In an interview with Adam Nayman , who notes that Cockburn 's previous short pieces carry a recurrent theme of technophobia , Cockburn said he wanted to make a movie that expressed anxiety about a world where mapping and archiving the world is more substantial than the world itself : " Photography or video is already one step removed from reality . The second step away from reality is : how is it stored , how is it findable ? There 's the world , there 's pictures of the world , and there 's this multitude of search engines that you can use . " In a similar vein , Cockburn , said the film is all about " location , or at least talking around the idea of location ... the non-specificity of place ... closely connected to the anxiety and uncertainty-of - selfhood that I hope is somewhere near the movie 's heart . " In an interview with John Semley , Cockburn acknowledges Jorge Luis Borges as an influence on '' You Are Here '' , in particular , " where he talks about imagining the path that someone travels in their life and how if you could see that path it might somehow form a shape " , that is , a trace " that no person will ever be able to know or see or understand . " That idea is structurally the heart of the movie , but it 's also key to the emotional resonance . All the characters are struggling to come to terms with the fact that they ca n't know the bigger picture of the universe they ’re living in . They ca n't know how they relate to the other pieces . They ca n’t see the traces they are leaving . Cockburn has related how , at the 35th annual Toronto International Film Festival , in response to someone asking the actors what they thought the movie was about , most of the actors having just seen it for the first time , R.D. Reid said : " I think this film is about the attempt to deal with a deep-rooted despair " , which surprised Cockburn , since they had not talked about it : " I was really gratified to hear him say that . I thought that is a very appropriate interpretation of the movie . " In the same exchange , Cockburn also noted : " A couple of people have written about it being hopeful , which I 'll accept . " In his interview with Cockburn , Adam Nayman argued that the film was hopeful " insofar as it urges the viewer to simply take stock of his and her reality and act accordingly , " to which Cockburn replied : " It 's gratifying to hear it positioned that way . " In a number of interviews , Cockburn has said that '' You Are Here '' is ultimately related to a period when he went through a paranoid-delusional breakdown : " everything I saw , read , and heard was some sort of message to me that needed to be decoded . " It was a period of " intense meaning-making ... I 'd be looking at any text I 'd encounter like a menu or road sign and I 'd scramble the letters around and see if there were any different codes there that needed to be deciphered . " After a long time , he realized that this behaviour , which was emotionally exhausting and troubling , had emotional underpinnings : " It became something that was n't just an enjoyable intellectual play . ... In a number of ways I worked through it , and part of that was figuring out what the emotional reasons were . " That experience " stayed " with him and worked its way into " just about everything " he wrote or directed : '' You Are Here '' is a compendium of characters dealing with the question of whether their life is just a series of random events , or whether there ’s some " Great Code " at the heart of it all . It 's a cerebral concept , but when you 're in the middle of it , it 's scary and exciting and sometimes even funny , and that , for me , is the heart of the movie . Cockburn 's literary influences for '' You Are Here '' include Paul Auster and especially Jorge Luis Borges . His film influences include the directors Todd Haynes ( '' Poison '' and '' I 'm Not There '' in particular ) , " for how he plays with film language with multiple styles in one movie , or the same character being played by multiple actors " , and Charlie Kaufman ( '' Synecdoche , New York '' ) , which " came out just as we were beginning to cut '' You Are Here '' " . The film was a Rosetta Stone of sorts , " in its willingness to seriously mess around with the supposed rules of filmmaking and storytelling , but ultimately being a comprehensible and moving experience that hits you on levels you did n’t even know you had . " It gave Cockburn a lot of hope for his own film

		CONTEXT=During its world premiere at Sundance , '' The Raid 2 '' received an overwhelming reaction . Mark Olsen of the '' Los Angeles Times '' reported that " The screening caused an explosion of excitement and enthusiasm for the film on social media . " In a 3-out-of-5 mixed review , Joey Magidson of the website '' Awards Circuit '' wrote that he " appreciate ( s ) the directing skills on display in '' The Raid 2 '' , but at a certain point , all of the fighting and killing nearly got to be too much for me . I ’m recommending the film , but not in the same way as the last one . " He added that while it is " creative enough to be worth a recommendation , it lacks the originality of the first flick " and concluded that " '' The Raid 2 '' will delight genre fans , but might not impress to many others . " Chris Nashawaty of '' Entertainment Weekly '' said , " '' The Raid 2 '' will make you feel like Christmas came nine months early . Some action sequels do n't know when to say when . But here 's one where too much is just the right amount . " Simon Abrams of ''RogerEbert.com '' praised the film for its " involving plot " ; calling the cast , especially Uwais , " charming " and dialogue " winningly precise " while noting that the sequel is " a great step up after the already-impressive '' The Raid '' . " David Rooney of '' The Hollywood Reporter '' gave the film a positive review , remarking , " Evans gives the audience a knowing wink by having Rama endure repeated batterings that would leave mere mortals in traction , not to mention some nasty blade wounds . Yet he keeps coming back , finding the stamina to snap more limbs and crush more skulls . Taking place inside moving vehicles , a subway car , a noodle bar , warehouses , a porn factory , tight corridors and in the most electrifying mano-a-mano clash , a gleaming nightclub kitchen and wine cellar , the fights are dynamite . " '' Rolling Stone '' chief critic Peter Travers wrote , " '' The Raid 2 '' lets its warriors rip for two and a half thrilling hours . With the precision of dance and the punch of a K.O. champion , Evans keeps the action coming like nobody 's business . " Many have praised the film for matching the action sequences that made the first film so great , as well as improving upon the plot and the dialogue , which its predecessor was criticized for

		CONTEXT=The film received positive reviews and response from both the critics and audience . Rachit Gupta from '' Filmfare '' gave the film a rating of 4.5 / 5 , stating , " SS Rajamouli 's much-awaited sequel is the kind of movie Indian cinema should make regularly . It 's the kind of sweeping magnum opus that Indian mythos and culture deserve . It 's the biggest film we have ever made and barring a few minor glitches in CGI , this film is possibly the greatest spectacle you 'll see on a big screen , in your life . " Sangeetha Devi Dundoo from '' The Hindu '' stated , " For the most part , The Conclusion does n't let us take our eyes off the screen . It 's designed to be a cinematic celebration , one that deserves to be watched on the largest screen possible " . Anupama Subramanian of the '' Deccan Chronicle '' gave the film a 3.5 / 5 , praising the acting of the stars while complaining about " the lack of a solid plot ' and called the ending " predictable . " Vishnuprasad Pillai of '' Asianet News '' gave a negative review , writing that the film " offers nothing new ... The writing from KV Vijayendra Prasad fails inspire or to do justice to an epic of such scale , " adding that " the dialogues at times are downright corny and plot developments cringe-worthy . " Dipanjan Sinha of '' Hindustan Times '' gave the film a rating of 3/5 stars , praising the film 's cinematography and special effects , but found faults with some of the female characters . Sinha stated , " Devasena ... starts off as an ace warrior only to be tamed into someone who has to be protected . " Shubhra Gupta of '' Indian Express '' rated the film 2/5 stars , noting problems with pacing and sound , writing , " The background music is relentless , and the pitch at which the declamatory dialogues are delivered is deafening : there were times I felt like closing my ears . " Taran Adarsh of '' Bollywood Hungama '' rates the film 4.5 out of 5 and praises the performance of the cast , writing , " It 's a feast for moviegoers and has the trappings to make all generations its fan . " Meena Iyer from '' The Times of India '' rated it 4/5 , writing : " Just savor it . It is a visual extravaganza that India must feast on ... Prabhas is terrific as father and son . Of course , it is CGI and VFX that grab you in your seat . " Hemanth Kumar from '' Firstpost '' called it " Rajamouli 's epic drama " and rated it 4/5 . Sukanya Verma from '' Rediff '' rated the film 3.5 / 5 , writing the film , " continues its tradition of grandiloquence and magnitude ... high drama , more than spectacle , is what lends its riveting tale of revenge and glory all its wallop and wizardry . " She also praised the film 's cast and director stating , " Equipped with a cast that 's not only in tune with Rajamouli 's vision but knows exactly where to hold back and when to give their all adds to Baahubali 's might . " It was further featured in Rotten Tomatoes ' list of Best Off the Radar Films of 2017 , in which Tim Ryan writes , " '' Baahubali 2 : The Conclusion '' plays like a shotgun wedding between '' Ben Hur '' and '' Kung Fu Hustle '' , seasoned with bits of Shakespeare , Kurosawa , and Buster Keaton , " opining , " it 's a blockbuster that 's both gigantic and lighter than air . " Mike McCahill of The Guardian gave a 4/5 rating and called it " a jaw-dropping blockbuster that combines nimble action with genuine heart " . He also stated , " This production 's triumph is the room it 's granted Rajamouli to head into the fields and dream up endlessly expressive ways to frame bodies in motion . Of the many sequences here primed to cut through jadedness , perhaps the most wondrous is that which finds Baahu guiding Deva mid-battle to shoot three arrows simultaneously – a set piece that speaks both to a love of action , and love in action . The budget 's big , the muscle considerable , but they 're nothing compared with '' Baahubali '' s heart . " Manjusha Radhakrishnan of '' Gulf News '' rates the film 3.5 out of 5 and writes , " This is a sweeping visual spectacle filled with epic battle scenes , clashes between warring troops from Indian mythology and elephants on a rampage , " but further added , " There were times in the second half where you felt the computer-generated graphics took over the story . But all this is new and exotic for Indian cinema . " Shilpa Jamkhandikar of '' Reuters '' writes , " It may not up the ante from the last film , but it does n't let up on the pace either . For an Indian film , that is no mean feat . " J Hurtado of '' ScreenAnarchy '' writes , " It 's a bit daunting because it does begin in media res immediately following the complex actions of the first film , but astute viewers will put together the pieces soon enough . " Kabita Maharana of '' International Business Times '' gave a rating of 4 out of 5 and writes , " From the very first scene , the film is a visual extravaganza . Every frame is meticulously captured by SS Rajamouli and his team . This is the first Indian film hailed for excelling in visual effects . " Simon Abrams of RogerEbert.com gave the film a 4/4 rating and writes the film " is everything I want but rarely get from superhero and big-budget fantasy movie " adding " the fight scenes ... are so creative that they make even the most frequently abused creative shortcuts seem novel , everything from computer-generated imagery ( CGI ) to speed-ramping ... You care what happens to the cast as they , aided by wires , hurl volleys of arrows at disposable minions and CGI animals . " Anita Iyer from '' Khaleej Times '' rates the film 3.5 out of 5 and writes , " What stands out in the film is the powerful star cast . Enough has been said already about the acting prowess of Prabhas but he has an equally supportive cast to hold the film . Ramya Krishna as Sivagami , is known for her impressive acting talent and proves her mettle here . Another veteran , Sathyaraj as Katappa excels and you develop a camaraderie with him . Rana Daggubati is aptly spiteful in his portrayal of the villain ... Nassar , as his father , is busy spewing venom but his role could have been meatier . " '' The Conclusion '' won the Telstra People 's Choice Award at the Indian Film Festival of Melbourne , sharing the prize with '' Dangal '' . Tamannaah Bhatia and K.V. Vijayendra Prasad won the Global Indian Impact Icon Award for '' The Conclusion '' at NRI of the Year Awards .

According to review aggregator Metacritic , the album has a score of 48/100 based on 8 reviews , indicating " mixed or average reviews " . On another aggregator website , Album of the Year , it holds the 4th position on a list of worst reviewed albums of 2014 . Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic gave the album 2.5 stars out of 5 saying that " Michele is not a natural pop star . This was true in 2009 when she debuted on '' Glee '' as Rachel Berry and it 's even clearer in 2014 . " Mike Ayers from '' Billboard '' gave a mostly positive review , saying , " Lyrically , '' Louder '' is rather one-sided , as she often sings about the perils of relationships , over and over , in ways that we 've all heard many times at this point . Still , it 's a solid effort that shows she has promise as a bonafide pop artist . " Sarah Rodman of '' The Boston Globe '' gave the album a mostly positive review , writing , " The Broadway veteran puts her mighty soprano through its paces on bouncy dance tracks , soaring ballads , and midtempo pop tunes where she straddles the line , mostly comfortably , between Katy Perry and Celine Dion . " Kyle Anderson of '' Entertainment Weekly '' gave the album a B - , writing , " It 's hard to be that mad at '' Louder '' , because it 's so admirably and lovingly crafted . There 's nothing wrong with Lea Michele 's debut , and that 's its biggest problem . While well curated and exquisitely executed , '' Louder '' is missing the visceral oomph that defines the gulf between superstars and the rest of the top 40 chum . " At '' USA Today '' , Jerry Shriver rated the album 2.5 stars out of four , and stated that " softer would have been a better approach . " He added that the song " Battlefield " points to a more promising direction . Kevin McFarland of '' The A.V. Club '' gave a C - rating , writing , " '' Louder '' , Michele 's debut solo album under her own name , does feature her distinctive talent as a vocalist . But the record is caught in an unfortunate stylistic limbo between fun-loving , youthful pop and the maturity of adult contemporary artists . " Jim Farber of the '' New York Daily News '' awarded the album two stars . He criticized , " Michele does n't so much sing as trumpet like an elephant eager for the charge . Her voice has more need than vulnerability , more anger than understanding . " Christopher R. Weingarten of '' Rolling Stone '' also gave a negative review , stating , " This album of insta-dated EDM-pop anthems and half-cocked bass drops probably wo n't help Michele 's cause . The songs about love 's ups and downs have a few memorable lyrics ( ' My heart 's too drunk to drive ' ) but not nearly enough .

		ANSWER=hopeful " insofar as it urges the viewer to simply take stock of his and her reality and act accordingly
		GOLD_MENTION=35th annual Toronto International Film Festival
		CONTEXT=Though it is never explicitly invoked , '' You Are Here '' is primarily about the Internet and the information society . At a festival question-and-answer session in Utrecht , Cockburn said the film comes from anxieties and feelings " that are very specifc to the current digital age " . In an interview with Adam Nayman , who notes that Cockburn 's previous short pieces carry a recurrent theme of technophobia , Cockburn said he wanted to make a movie that expressed anxiety about a world where mapping and archiving the world is more substantial than the world itself : " Photography or video is already one step removed from reality . The second step away from reality is : how is it stored , how is it findable ? There 's the world , there 's pictures of the world , and there 's this multitude of search engines that you can use . " In a similar vein , Cockburn , said the film is all about " location , or at least talking around the idea of location ... the non-specificity of place ... closely connected to the anxiety and uncertainty-of - selfhood that I hope is somewhere near the movie 's heart . " In an interview with John Semley , Cockburn acknowledges Jorge Luis Borges as an influence on '' You Are Here '' , in particular , " where he talks about imagining the path that someone travels in their life and how if you could see that path it might somehow form a shape " , that is , a trace " that no person will ever be able to know or see or understand . " That idea is structurally the heart of the movie , but it 's also key to the emotional resonance . All the characters are struggling to come to terms with the fact that they ca n't know the bigger picture of the universe they ’re living in . They ca n't know how they relate to the other pieces . They ca n’t see the traces they are leaving . Cockburn has related how , at the 35th annual Toronto International Film Festival , in response to someone asking the actors what they thought the movie was about , most of the actors having just seen it for the first time , R.D. Reid said : " I think this film is about the attempt to deal with a deep-rooted despair " , which surprised Cockburn , since they had not talked about it : " I was really gratified to hear him say that . I thought that is a very appropriate interpretation of the movie . " In the same exchange , Cockburn also noted : " A couple of people have written about it being hopeful , which I 'll accept . " In his interview with Cockburn , Adam Nayman argued that the film was hopeful " insofar as it urges the viewer to simply take stock of his and her reality and act accordingly , " to which Cockburn replied : " It 's gratifying to hear it positioned that way . " In a number of interviews , Cockburn has said that '' You Are Here '' is ultimately related to a period when he went through a paranoid-delusional breakdown : " everything I saw , read , and heard was some sort of message to me that needed to be decoded . " It was a period of " intense meaning-making ... I 'd be looking at any text I 'd encounter like a menu or road sign and I 'd scramble the letters around and see if there were any different codes there that needed to be deciphered . " After a long time , he realized that this behaviour , which was emotionally exhausting and troubling , had emotional underpinnings : " It became something that was n't just an enjoyable intellectual play . ... In a number of ways I worked through it , and part of that was figuring out what the emotional reasons were . " That experience " stayed " with him and worked its way into " just about everything " he wrote or directed : '' You Are Here '' is a compendium of characters dealing with the question of whether their life is just a series of random events , or whether there ’s some " Great Code " at the heart of it all . It 's a cerebral concept , but when you 're in the middle of it , it 's scary and exciting and sometimes even funny , and that , for me , is the heart of the movie . Cockburn 's literary influences for '' You Are Here '' include Paul Auster and especially Jorge Luis Borges . His film influences include the directors Todd Haynes ( '' Poison '' and '' I 'm Not There '' in particular ) , " for how he plays with film language with multiple styles in one movie , or the same character being played by multiple actors " , and Charlie Kaufman ( '' Synecdoche , New York '' ) , which " came out just as we were beginning to cut '' You Are Here '' " . The film was a Rosetta Stone of sorts , " in its willingness to seriously mess around with the supposed rules of filmmaking and storytelling , but ultimately being a comprehensible and moving experience that hits you on levels you did n’t even know you had . " It gave Cockburn a lot of hope for his own film

Screened during the 2012 Sundance Film Festival , Winstead 's performance earned her rave reviews , with ''JoBlo.com '' calling it : " the type of performance that could be Award-worthy if given the right kind of build-up by whichever studio picks it up " . The film was released theatrically on October 12 , 2012 , and saw Winstead snagging the Dallas International Film Festival Award for Best Actress . During a promotional interview for the movie with website Collider , she expressed pride in working on an independent project : " It 's something I 've been trying to do for years and years ... It 's almost like my first movie in a weird way , cause it 's my first movie in this world , which is a world I 've been trying to break into . I 've wanted to be around filmmakers that are trying new things and not part of the system , so to speak , and they 're doing things on their own terms . " Winstead played the role of Mary Todd Lincoln opposite Benjamin Walker in '' Abraham Lincoln : Vampire Hunter '' . The film , also released in 2012 , received a mixed critical response while it flopped at the box office . Nevertheless , critics praised Winstead 's performance . The '' San Jose Mercury News '' called Winstead " a standout " , and the '' Illinois Times '' film critic wrote , " Winstead humanizes Mary Todd Lincoln by giving her a fiery wit and sense of resolve in the face of considerable adversity " . Winstead was commended for scenes opposite Benjamin Walker , with '' Little White Lies '' writing that they shared : " a sweet chemistry that gives their handful of scenes an endearing warmth "

		GOLD_MENTION=MTV Movie Award
		CONTEXT=Elvis Mitchell of '' The New York Times '' wrote : " The performances give the movie more flavor and life than the situation does ; it often feels like prechewed Bubble Yum . The message of the plot is that a lack of sophistication is the key to success , even at a fashion magazine that attracts readers through sexy exhibitionism . The movie would have shown some daring savvy if it had played more with the role-playing aspect of fashion spreads . Instead it is content to eat its retro snack cake and have it , too . " Andrea Gronvall of the '' Chicago Reader '' wrote that " The formula works , thanks in large part to star Jennifer Garner , who 's so radiant theaters should be stocking sunblock . Underlying the shenanigans and the pop-psychology moral — self-love is a prerequisite for true love — there 's a touching wistfulness about roads not taken . " Jorge Morales of '' The Village Voice '' commented : " The thirtysomething in me was all , gag me with a spoon , but the kid in me was like , this movie 's rad to the max .
