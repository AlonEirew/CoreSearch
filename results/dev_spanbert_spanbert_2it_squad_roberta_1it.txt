		ANSWER=Lockerbie bombing
		GOLD_MENTION=the Lockerbie bombing
		CONTEXT=On 4 October 2009 , Fred Halliday , Emeritus Professor of International Relations at the LSE and the School 's leading expert on the Middle East , wrote a memorandum to the LSE Council regarding the proposed cooperation with the Gaddafi Foundation . " I have repeatedly expressed reservations about formal educational and funding links with that country . " While those in favour of accepting the donation argued that " Libya is changing internally , " most informed observers agree that while some of the worst excesses for the moment have ceased , the rights of its people are badly protected . Libya " remains a country run by a secretive , erratic and corrupt elite . " Since 9/11 the Libyan government has reached compromises with the West on a number of issues , notably the Lockerbie bombing and nuclear weapons . Yet tactical changes in foreign policy are not sufficient for the purposes of evaluating political and academic links . There are also ways in which Libyan foreign policy has '' not '' changed : the country continues to call for the destruction of Israel ; Muammar Gaddafi recently called for the abolition of Switzerland , and he receives the leader of the Somali pirates operating off the Horn of Africa as honoured guests of state . Moreover , Libya 's handling of the Lockerbie bombing " has not been characterised by either consistency or clarity , " I have in the past , Halliday noted , defended accepting grants from authoritarian regimes such as the Gulf states , " but there should be clear limits on this , depending on the degree of political and human rights abuses perpetrated with them and on their ongoing foreign policy conduct . " Whitehall and the City are now happy to do business with Libya , but it does not follow that the LSE should do the same . Responsible leaders throughout the Middle East continue to express reservations regarding Libya , including " its more prominent ' liberal ' representatives . " We must remember , Halliday concluded , that the " liberal " wing within a regime such as Libya does not have the function of producing change but its role is instead " to reach compromises with internal hard-liners that serve to lessen external pressure . " A good case in point are the proposals LSE now is considering . It is , as LSE alumni in positions of responsibility in the region caution , " far too early for the School to take this step . " In 2009 , Human Rights Watch was allowed entry to Libya , via Saif al-Islam Gaddafi 's non-profit organization in order to gather facts about the human rights situation there . While HRW reported that there were concerns about the " repressive atmosphere , " they felt there were signs of " improvement " and Sarah Leah Whitson , director of HRW 's Middle East division said that one should not " underestimate the importance of the efforts made so far " by Gaddafi in the realm of human rights in Libya . She also wrote of her official visit that " the real impetus for the transformation rests squarely with a quasi-governmental organization , the Qaddafi Foundation for International Charities and Development " chaired by Gaddafi . She praised Gaddafi for establishing the country 's two semi-private newspapers , and said " it is impossible to underestimate the importance of the efforts made so far . Let 's hope this spring will last . " In January 2011 , HRW criticised other organisations as well as governments that had previously dealt with Gaddafi . HRW Business and Human Rights Director Arvind Ganesan condemned the London School of Economics ( LSE ) for allowing " abusive and corrupt officials or their families to launder their images in exchange for money " . This was later followed by Ganesen saying that " the London School of Economics did not act until Saif al-Islam 's father literally began to kill his own people " . According to NGO Monitor , this was despite the fact that David Held , Co-Director of LSE Global Governance , was partially influenced by Whitson 's remarks regarding her Libyan visit , referring to Saif al-Islam Gaddafi as a reformer

The violence included acts of terrorism such as the 2006 Moscow market bombing which killed 13 people . In 2007 , 18-year-old Artur Ryno claimed responsibility for 37 racially motivated murders in the course of one year , saying that " since school he hated people from the Caucasus . " On 5 June 2007 , an anti-Chechen riot involving hundreds of people took place in the town of Stavropol in southern Russia . Rioters demanded the eviction of ethnic Chechens following the murder of two young Russians who locals believed were killed by Chechens . The event revived memories of a recent clash between Chechens and local Russians in Kondopoga over an unpaid bill , when two Russians were killed . The Caucasians also face ethnic-related violence in the ranks of Russian Army

		GOLD_MENTION=Camp Chapman attack
		CONTEXT=Lashkar-e-Taiba , a Kashmiri militant group which is thought to be behind 2008 Mumbai attacks , is also known to have strong ties to senior al-Qaeda leaders living in Pakistan . In Late 2002 , top al-Qaeda operative Abu Zubaydah was arrested while being sheltered by Lashkar-e-Taiba in a safe house in Faisalabad . The FBI believes that al-Qaeda and Lashkar have been ' intertwined ' for a long time while the CIA has said that al-Qaeda funds Lashkar-e-Taiba . Jean-Louis Bruguière told Reuters in 2009 that " Lashkar-e-Taiba is no longer a Pakistani movement with only a Kashmir political or military agenda . Lashkar-e-Taiba is a member of al-Qaeda . " In a video released in 2008 , American-born senior al-Qaeda operative Adam Yahiye Gadahn stated that " victory in Kashmir has been delayed for years ; it is the liberation of the jihad there from this interference which , Allah willing , will be the first step towards victory over the Hindu occupiers of that Islam land . " In September 2009 , a US drone strike reportedly killed Ilyas Kashmiri who was the chief of Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami , a Kashmiri militant group associated with al-Qaeda . Kashmiri was described by Bruce Riedel as a ' prominent ' al-Qaeda member while others have described him as head of military operations for al-Qaeda . Kashmiri was also charged by the US in a plot against Jyllands-Posten , the Danish newspaper which was at the center of Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy . US officials also believe that Kashmiri was involved in the Camp Chapman attack against the CIA . In January 2010 , Indian authorities notified Britain of an al-Qaeda plot to hijack an Indian airlines or Air India plane and crash it into a British city . This information was uncovered from interrogation of Amjad Khwaja , an operative of Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami , who had been arrested in India

		CONTEXT=Having noticed the advantages of the combination of social media and Phoneography , some well-known newspapers , news magazines and professional photojournalists decided to employ iPhone journalism as a new approach . When the London Bombings happened in July 2005 , for the first time , both the '' New York Times '' and the '' Washington Post '' ran photos on their front pages made by citizen journalists with camera phones . As work of witnesses and survivors , the images were less the outcome of documentary intent than a response to a traumatic shock . These photos represented ' vivid , factual accounts of history as it explodes around us ' , as described by '' Washington Post '' journalist Robert MacMillan . In another instance , when superstorm Sandy hit the East Coast , causing great damage and casualty , Time sent out five photographers with iPhones to document the devastation . Photographers dived deep into the site and captured pictures in close proximity to the storm and human suffering . One of the shots , raging ocean waves collapsing on Coney Island in Brooklyn , taken by Benjamin Lowy , made the cover of Time 's November 12 issue . Then in 2013 , the Chicago Sun-Times got rid of its entire staff of 28 photographers , including John H. White , a Pulitzer Prize winner in photography . The newspaper cited viewers shifting towards more video as a reason . They then employed freelance photographers and required them to train in how to use an iPhone for photography to fill the gap . Some viewers online were quick to point out an at times reduction in quality in comparison to the newspaper 's previous full-time professionals

		CONTEXT=Lashkar-e-Taiba , a Kashmiri militant group which is thought to be behind 2008 Mumbai attacks , is also known to have strong ties to senior al-Qaeda leaders living in Pakistan . In Late 2002 , top al-Qaeda operative Abu Zubaydah was arrested while being sheltered by Lashkar-e-Taiba in a safe house in Faisalabad . The FBI believes that al-Qaeda and Lashkar have been ' intertwined ' for a long time while the CIA has said that al-Qaeda funds Lashkar-e-Taiba . Jean-Louis Bruguière told Reuters in 2009 that " Lashkar-e-Taiba is no longer a Pakistani movement with only a Kashmir political or military agenda . Lashkar-e-Taiba is a member of al-Qaeda . " In a video released in 2008 , American-born senior al-Qaeda operative Adam Yahiye Gadahn stated that " victory in Kashmir has been delayed for years ; it is the liberation of the jihad there from this interference which , Allah willing , will be the first step towards victory over the Hindu occupiers of that Islam land . " In September 2009 , a US drone strike reportedly killed Ilyas Kashmiri who was the chief of Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami , a Kashmiri militant group associated with al-Qaeda . Kashmiri was described by Bruce Riedel as a ' prominent ' al-Qaeda member while others have described him as head of military operations for al-Qaeda . Kashmiri was also charged by the US in a plot against Jyllands-Posten , the Danish newspaper which was at the center of Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy . US officials also believe that Kashmiri was involved in the Camp Chapman attack against the CIA . In January 2010 , Indian authorities notified Britain of an al-Qaeda plot to hijack an Indian airlines or Air India plane and crash it into a British city . This information was uncovered from interrogation of Amjad Khwaja , an operative of Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami , who had been arrested in India

		ANSWER=massive pogroms
		GOLD_MENTION=battle for Pińsk
		CONTEXT=In the aftermath of the Great War localized conflicts engulfed Eastern Europe between 1917 and 1919 . Many attacks were launched against Jews during the Russian Civil War , the Polish-Ukrainian War , and the Polish – Soviet War ending with the Treaty of Riga . Almost half of the Jewish men perceived to have supported the Bolshevik Russia in these incidents were in their 20s . Just after the end of World War I , the West became alarmed by reports about alleged massive pogroms in Poland against Jews . Pressure for government action reached the point where U.S. President Woodrow Wilson sent an official commission to investigate the matter . The commission , led by Henry Morgenthau , Sr. , concluded in its Morgenthau Report that allegations of pogroms were exaggerated . It identified eight incidents in the years 1918 – 1919 out of 37 mostly empty claims for damages , and estimated the number of victims at 280 . Four of these were attributed to the actions of deserters and undisciplined individual soldiers ; none was blamed on official government policy . Among the incidents , during the battle for Pińsk a commander of Polish infantry regiment accused a group of Jewish men of plotting against the Poles and ordered the execution of thirty-five Jewish men and youth . The Morgenthau Report found the charge to be " devoid of foundation " even though their meeting was illegal to the extent of being treasonable . In the Lwów ( Lviv ) pogrom , which occurred in 1918 during the Polish – Ukrainian War of independence a day after the Poles captured Lviv from the Sich Riflemen – the report concluded – 64 Jews had been killed ( other accounts put the number at 72 ) . In Warsaw , soldiers of Blue Army assaulted Jews in the streets , but were punished by military authorities . Many other events in Poland were later found to have been exaggerated , especially by contemporary newspapers such as '' The New York Times '' , although serious abuses against the Jews , including pogroms , continued elsewhere , especially in Ukraine . The above-mentioned atrocities committed by the young Polish army and its allies in 1919 during their Kiev operation against the Bolsheviks had a profound impact on the foreign perception of the re-emerging Polish state . The result of the concerns over the fate of Poland 's Jews was a series of explicit clauses in the Versailles Treaty signed by the Western powers , and President Paderewski , protecting the rights of minorities in new Poland including Germans . In 1921 , Poland 's March Constitution gave the Jews the same legal rights as other citizens and guaranteed them religious tolerance and freedom of religious holidays

		CONTEXT=Under Yitzhak Rabin , the Israeli government proposed closing down the settlement at Tel Rumeida after the Cave of the Patriarchs massacre . Far-right rabbis moved to block evacuation of the settlements by issuing an Halakhic ruling against removal of settlements in Eretz Israel . The collective influence of the settlers and their Rabbis , in what one scholar has called , ' one of the most effective mobilization efforts in settler history , ' persuaded Prime Minister Rabin to back down . The Dir al-Arba ' in mosque , where Hebronite Palestinians had prayed until the mid-1990s , was declared a closed military zone , and converted into a synagogue , renamed by settlers '' Tomb of Ruth and Jesse '' , and thenceforth all access to it by Muslims was forbidden ostensibly for security reasons . According to Karin Aggestam , attempts to convert the mosque into a Jewish national shrine , including painting its door blue , are in violation of the Hebron Protocol , which committed both Israel and Palestine to preserving and protecting the historic character of the city without harm or changes . During the Al-Aqsa Intifada , the Jewish settlement came under regular fire from Palestinian militants

		ANSWER=Columbine High School massacre
		GOLD_MENTION=Columbine High School massacre
		CONTEXT=Marilyn Manson 's performance in Denver , Colorado on June 22 , 2001 at the Mile High Stadium also drew attention from the national news media . The event was part of their commitments with the heavy metal festival tour Ozzfest and marked the band 's first performance in the state since the Columbine High School massacre in nearby Littleton , Colorado on April 20 , 1999 . The band was initially blamed for inciting shooters Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold into killing their classmates , though these reports would later be proven to be false . The band initially pulled out due to scheduling conflicts , however , the group later altered their plans in order to accommodate the Denver date . The band met heavy resistance from conservative groups and the performer received numerous death threats and calls to skip the date . A group of church leaders and families related to the Columbine tragedy formed an organization specifically to oppose their show called ' Citizens for Peace and Respect ' , which drew the support of Colorado governor Bill Owens ( R-Colo ) and representative Tom Tancredo ( R-Colo ) . The group held a rally outside the Mile High Stadium where organizer , youth pastor Jason Janz , delivered a speech stating , " If Marilyn Manson can walk into our town , promote hate , violence , suicide , death , drug use and Columbine-like behavior , I can say , ' Not without a fight you ca n't . ' " Janz further said , " We do n't think Manson caused Columbine , but he encourages and legitimizes Columbine-like behavior . " Marilyn Manson responded to the assertions of ' Citizens for Peace and Respect ' by issuing a statement saying , A group of Marilyn Manson supporters also responded to ' Citizens for Peace and Respect ' by forming an organization called ' Citizens for the Protection of the Right to Free Speech ' . The group held a rally in front of the Colorado State Capitol where organizer Carrieanne Andrews , a mother of three , stated that " We just wanted to show that Jason Janz does not speak for our entire community " and that they resented " being told how to be good parents . " The Denver show would later provide the backdrop for Manson 's landmark interview on America 's climate of fear and culture of gun violence in Michael Moore 's 2002 documentary '' Bowling for Columbine '' . When Moore asked what he would have said if he had the opportunity to speak to the students at Columbine , he replied , " I would n't say a single word . I would listen to what they have to say and that 's what no one did . " Another incident took place leading up to The Gig On The Green festival on August 25 , 2001 in Glasgow , Scotland . Members of the Glasgow community were calling for Marilyn Manson 's performance at the festival to be boycotted . Beth Nimmo , the mother of the Columbine killer 's first victim , Rachel Scott , joined in the protests and told Scottish tabloid newspaper '' Daily Record '' on August 8 , 2001 , " I do n't doubt that his kind of music definitely affects young people and can desensitize them . People need to be strong enough not to listen to it . There is nothing entertaining about real violence . It has real consequences and brings nothing but destruction and pain . " In a separate incident , a Catholic Charismatic Renewal group protested in early August 2001 at the Glasgow city centre , where the Glasgow City Council were deciding on the final licensing application for Gig On The Green . This was due the inclusion of both Eminem and Marilyn Manson on the bill . Both attempts failed

		CONTEXT=Critical opinion regarding the film has been overwhelmingly positive . '' The Village Voice '' critic J. Hoberman , who in 1981 included the film in his list of the ten best films commercially released in the United States during that year , more recently wrote that the film is one " of the richest avant-garde features of the 1970s " and praised its " winning combination of sexual frankness and visual wit , " while another critic , Dennis Schwartz , wrote that the " film 's beauty is derived from its sexual frankness and playfully drawn out intimate relationship scenes , witty use of photography , and its originality as it breaks free of conventional unities of body , space and time . Export skillfully edits montage and integrates video , still photography , and performance art with elements from Cubism , Surrealism , Dada and avant-garde cinema . " '' Artforum '' noted in November 1980 that " w atching their scenes together , we realize how seldom , if ever before , the details of sexual intimacy have been shown in film from the point of view from a woman . Export privileges rupture over unity and never settles for one-dimensional solutions " and it was called one " of the most original films in this year 's exposition " and a " tour de force of cinematic invention " grounded in the director 's " fresh and intelligent sensibility , characteristically self-referential . Her visual resources include mirrors , still photography , video , dance , and films within the film , all employed with a bold and surprising inventiveness " by the catalogue notes of the 1978 Los Angeles International Film Exposition . Similarly , critic Alison Butler wrote that the " film is a witty and visually brilliant essay on gender and experience , culture and environment " and program notes used by the San Francisco Cinematheque during a screening quote critic Amy Taubin as opining that the film " makes you reconsider what you and everyone else is doing — in life and in art " and critic Steve Anker underscoring that it is an important " crossover film " combining " avant-garde and theatrical sensibilities , made during the mid-1970s . It chronicles the nightmarish breakdown of a fashion photographer as she confronts her waning identity and security as a career woman ; blending narrative experimentation , fantasy , fact and theoretical critique , it has enormous impact on independent features which followed it . " PopMatters noted that the film has " enough originality to nag at patient viewers and get at least partially under our skin " and critic Michael Atkinson wrote that it is a " weird , restless , beguilingly offbeat bit of dreamwork . " The film was presented for the first time at the Berlin International Film Festival in 1977 , it has won a Special Jury Prize at the Venice Film Festival and was recently called " seminal " during a screening at a repertory cinema , " a strong and humoristic showdown " at another and " a sonically-complex , montage-rich , darkly funny and uriniferous cornerstone of avant-garde cinema " during a screening at a New York University class . Critic Peter Hajek wrote in the Austrian newspaper '' Kurier '' that " Valie Export presents this psychopanoptic view of the present in solid , striking images and often in unexpected humorous passages . " Critic Chris Holmlund , author of the scholarly article " Feminist Makeovers : The Celluloid Surgery of Valie Export and Su Friedrich , " referred to '' Invisible Adversaries '' as a feminist version of '' Invasion of the Body Snatchers '' , noted that the film includes references to famous paintings and to '' Un Chien Andalou '' , and wrote that therefore it " is visually rick , entertaining , striking , but also demanding . " A few reviews , however , were negative . For example , London 's '' Time Out '' wrote about the film that it is " n ot unlike '' W.R. : Mysteries of the Organism '' " and that it will " probably age as badly " and a reviewer for '' The Heights '' wrote that " I was expecting a great feminist work here , but got mediocrity . I can not recommend that you see this film , " though he nevertheless praised the film as a " cornucopia of video spectacle in which Export delights , confounds and amuses the audience with her antics .

Responding to criticism regarding the nudity in the film in an interview with GQ Magazine , Delpy remarked : Some people were like , ' it 's not feminist . You 're showing your tits and he 's not showing his ass . ' But is n't it the people who are hiding women behind layers of clothes who are the misogynists ? I 'm a real person , so it 's a statement to say , ' Alright , I 'm a forty year-old woman , and this is what you get with no plastic surgery . ' '' Lolo '' was Delpy 's second French-language feature film . It was also the first film she directed since '' 2 Days in New York '' .

Vissi had also participated in the Contest on two other occasion while she was still signed to Minos EMI : Greece in 1980 with " Autostop " , finishing 13th with 30 points , and for Cyprus in 1982 with " Mono I Agapi " , finishing fifth with 82 points . While her first performance was not a success , her second remains the highest placing that Cyprus has ever achieved in the Contest . Following Vissi 's later performance , she joined with Nikos Karvelas in an exclusive songwriting collaboration and with him they released an independent album in 1982 titled '' Eimai To Simera Kai Eisai To Hthes '' under their own label CarVi ( '' ' CAR '' ' velas '' ' VI '' ' ssi ) ; Vissi 's contract with Minos EMI did not allow for this and the album was deleted in a lawsuit in favor of Minos EMI , while Vissi then switched labels . The rights to the two Eurovision songs still belonged to EMI and thus they were never officially released on any of Vissi 's studio albums . However , in honor of her third participation in the Eurovision Song Contest , Minos EMI released a limited edition double A-side single containing both tracks prior to the release of Vissi 's Eurovision entry for promotion . The songs were also released on a 2006 remastered edition of Vissi 's self-titled 1981 album , which was now titled '' 4 '' , on the count of it being her fourth studio album . The title of the English-language version of the track " Mono I Agapi " was chosen instead as the name of the single , although the Greek-language version is the one that is actually featured

Al-Qaeda may have acted merely as an outside support base , or possibly in tandem with IBDA-C in terms of planning and execution .

When a guard finally grabbed him , Shafrazi shouted , " Call the curator . I am an artist . " The paint was easily removed as the painting was heavily varnished . It is believed that Shafrazi was protesting the announcement , the day before , of the release on bail of U.S. lieutenant William Calley . Calley , then under house arrest following his conviction , in 1971 , for his part in the My Lai massacre in Vietnam , had petitioned for habeas corpus ; he had initially been sentenced to life imprisonment . Although his appeal was overturned in June , he was finally released from U.S. Army custody later in the year after having received a limited pardon from Richard Nixon . Shafrazi was a member of the Art Workers ' Coalition , which in 1970 had staged a protest at MoMA by unfurling a copy of the famous My Lai protest poster '' And babies '' in front of the '' Guernica '' painting , which itself depicts the tragedies of war and the suffering it inflicts upon innocent civilians . Shafrazi was later given five years ' probation , without a trial

		CONTEXT=In 1941 , Yugoslavia surrendered unconditionally to the Axis powers during World War II . Hungary occupied Vojvodina . In January 1942 , Moscovich 's father was a victim of the Novi Sad massacre . His father died at age 44 . In 1943 , Hungary started secret armistice negotiations with the Allied Powers which was discovered by Germany resulting in the German occupation of Vojvodina . Soon after , at the age of 17 , Moscovich was taken to the concentration camp at Auschwitz with his grandfather , grandmother and mother . His grandparents were immediately taken to the crematoria and were killed . While his mother stayed in Auschwitz , Moscovich was moved to Wustegiersdorf , one of the surrounding work camps , laying rail lines . In January 1945 , Auschwitz was evacuated and Moscovich along with 60,000 prisoners marched west to Bergen-Belsen . After only a few days , Moscovich volunteered for a selection of 500 volunteer prisoner workers . These volunteers were sent to clear the railway station in Hildesheim by dislodging the wagons to free the rails so they could be fixed and used for German transports . While there , several groups found food supplies including sugar , butter , and eggs . On March 22 , Hildesheim was bombed killing or wounding both prisoners and German guards . The volunteers were made to move the bodies for easier identification . They were then marched to the Hannover-Ahlem prison camp . The prisoners worked in an asbestos mine converting it into an ammunition depot safe from aerial attacks . Hannover-Ahlem was evacuated on April 6 , 1945 and Moscovich marched towards Bergen-Belsen again . Moscovich describes the last days in Bergen-Belsen as “ the ultimate in human misery , suffering , degradation , death and humiliation . ” He hid himself among a pile of dead bodies to avoid the Germans

		CONTEXT=Operation Steinadler ( 3 – 13 July 1944 ) was the last counter-insurgency operation carried out by German forces in Macedonia . Although wide in its scope it ultimately failed to achieve its objectives as ELAS fighters successfully evaded the German patrols , returning to their hideouts once the operation was over . The civilian population thus became the main target for Axis reprisals . Shortly afterwards the German 1st Mountain Division and the 4th SS Polizei Panzergrenadier Division departed from the country , while in August Army Group E declared Greece a war zone . German shops and cultural institutions were closed , while civilians and older member of the army , secret police and SS were evacuated . Under Adolf Hitler 's orders the Wehrmacht adopted the policy of total war , in response to the rise of ELAS subversive activity which had hampered the summer harvest in areas still controlled by the collaborationist government . Army Group E 's staff deemed the preceding Distomo massacre and 1 May 1944 Kaisariani executions as excessive and even damaging to the image of the occupational authorities . The staff stressed the need to arrest insurgents rather than resorting to the collective punishment of civilians . Nevertheless , those orders were disregarded and atrocities continued unhindered . Between June and August , ELAS attacks led to the death of 30 German soldiers , 14 were wounded and 9 more were missing in action . German reprisals in their turn included the execution of 254 people

		CONTEXT=The ceremony was held on a night other than Sunday for the first time since 1976 ( the 28th Primetime Emmy Awards were also staged on a Monday that year , May 17 ) . The ceremony 's unusual date — a Monday night in late August — was due to two factors , primary being NBC 's commitment to '' Sunday Night Football '' ; since acquiring the National Football League 's Sunday night game package in 2006 , NBC , when it is their turn in the four-network rotation to air the Primetime Emmy Awards , usually schedules the ceremony for the Sunday before Labor Day weekend , to avoid conflicts with '' SNF '' in mid-September ( when ABC , CBS , or Fox normally air the ceremony ) . NBC 's ideal date on the 2014 calendar for the ceremony ( Sunday , August 24 ) led to the other scheduling factor — MTV 's Video Music Awards , which were set for that night more than a year in advance ( and would be staged in the L.A. area as well , at The Forum in Inglewood ) . On January 28 , 2014 , rather than go head-to-head with the VMA 's , NBC announced that the ceremony would take place on Monday , August 25 . The move would allow NBC to commit to a preseason '' Sunday Night Football '' broadcast for the 24th ( a game between the Cincinnati Bengals and Arizona Cardinals ) ; it also ensured the tradition of staging the Primetime Emmy Awards the weekend after the Creative Arts Emmy Awards ( that ceremony was already set for August 16 )

		CONTEXT=He arrived at the club as an incredibly shy and underdeveloped personality , a fact that was noted by teammate Trent Cotchin who said though Martin was 18 “ he seemed much younger in some of the ways he behaved . ” Indeed , he struggled initially to adjust to the expectations of professional football . In one incident in the 2010 preseason he was removed from training and verbally reprimanded by club leadership when he was deemed unfit to train after a big night out . Despite these struggles , his on-field development was such that he would still debut in the 2010 season 's opening match , a 56-point Richmond loss against at the MCG . Martin recorded the sixth most disposals of any Tiger ( 18 ) to go along with four marks , three tackles and three clearances . Two weeks later Martin was convicted by the AFL tribunal for a high hit on Sydney 's Josh Kennedy in round 3 . He did not receive a suspension for the incident however , returning to football the following week . After four matches Martin ranked fourth in the league for clearances and eighth for hard-ball gets . Media reports emerged after round 8 that the 18 year old Martin had received a significant contract offer from expansion club the Greater Western Sydney Giants . The offer , which the Herald Sun ’s Mark Robinson claimed to be worth $ 2.4 million over three seasons , would have taken effect in the new club 's first AFL season in 2012 . Martin later said he had never entertained the idea of moving to the start-up club . In round 10 he had gained attention for his on-field efforts again , this time being nominated for the 2010 AFL Rising Star award after a 21 disposal and 11 clearance match against Port Adelaide . Due to his previous tribunal conviction however , Martin was ruled ineligible for the award and thus did not officially place in the end of season award 's points tally . He drew the attention of Sydney coach Paul Roos by round 14 , prompting Roos to send veteran Brett Kirk onto Martin in a tagging role . Despite this extra attention , he still managed to record 18 disposals and a goal in the match at the MCG . After 17 rounds Martin ranked second at the club for clearances and inside 50s as well as third for disposals and contested possessions . At the same time he ranked first among that season 's Rising Star nominees in clearances , contested possessions and inside 50s . He was also fourth for average disposals and fifth for average tackles . In round 19 he was rested by the club before returning to play out the final five matches of the season . He missed just that one game in his debut season and finished the year ranked second at Richmond for clearances and inside 50s , as well as third for both contested possessions and disposals . In addition to winning the Fred Swift Medal for fourth place at the club 's best and fairest night , Martin also received six votes in the Brownlow Medal count that year , the most by any Richmond debutant since Craig Lambert in 1988 . At season 's end he reiterated his commitment to the club ( and rejection of the former GWS overtures ) by signing a two-year contract extension that would keep him at Richmond until the end of the 2013 season . The extension was reported by the Herald Sun to be in the vicinity of $ 400,000-a-year

		CONTEXT=The next influx of Jewish people to the Island of Djerba was during the Spanish Inquisition , when the Iberian Jewish population was no longer welcome and were forced to leave . The Jewish population hit its peak during the time that Tunisia was fighting for independence from France 1881-1956 In 1940 there were approximately 100,000 Jewish-Tunisians or 15 % of the entire population of Tunisia . In the aftermath of World War II , the Jewish population on the island declined significantly due to emigration to Israel and France . , the Jewish permanent resident community on the island numbered about 1,000 , but many return annually on pilgrimage . However , once the State of Israel was established , and political unrest in the Middle East and North Africa was building up many Jewish people left Tunisia . Although the Jewish community of Tunisia was on the decline , the Jewish community of Hara Kebira witnessed an increase of population due to its traditional character . Despite this , the community on Djerba remains one of the last remaining fully intact Jewish communities in an Arab majority country after most were abandoned in the face of anti-Israel and antisemitic pressure and pogroms . The mostly traditionally observant Jewish community is growing because of large natural families despite emigration and a new Orthodox Jewish school for girls has recently been inaugurated on the Island to serve alongside the two boy 's yeshiva schools . According to the '' Wall Street Journal '' " Relations between Jews and Muslims are complex — proper and respectful , though not especially close . Jewish men work alongside Arab merchants in the souk , for example , and enjoy amiable ties with Muslim customers . " The conflict that historically has occurred between Muslims and Jewish people does not happen in Djerba . The people of Djerba attribute this quality to the fact that all people of the Island were at some point Jewish and therefore share similar practices in their way of life . Some of these Jewish practices that can be seen in Muslim households in Djerba are the lighting of candles on Friday night , and the suspending of matzot on the ceiling from one spring to the next . The Jewish and Muslim communities coexist very peacefully in Djerba even during the political unrest in regards to the Palestinian and Israeli conflict . The people of Djerba say that the two communities simply pray in different places , but they are still able to converse . A Jewish leader once stated " We live together , We visit our friends on their religious holidays . We work together . Muslims buy meat from our butchers . when we are forbidden to work or cook on the Shabbat , we buy bread and kosher food cooking by Muslims . Our children play together " . On April 11 , 2002 , Al-Qaeda claimed responsibility for a truck bomb attack close to the famous synagogue , killing 21 people ( 14 German tourists , 5 Tunisians and 2 French nationals ) . Although tourists ceased visiting Djerba for some time after this event , normal activity has since resumed

Criticizing the programming he saw as " shuddering fluorescent jelly , " and inspired by Newton Minow 's famous " Wasteland Speech " in 1961 , Miller decided to move from reviewing into television production , hoping to provide innovative and intellectual content for the medium . Because the United States and the Soviet Union were vying to achieve a Moon landing , Miller conceived the idea of a satire based on Jules Verne 's '' From the Earth to the Moon '' , as he explained to the '' New York Times '' : The film was produced for '' Chronicle '' , a CBS documentary series that aired alternately with the '' CBS Reports '' . '' Chronicle '' , broadcast on Wednesday nights from October 1963 through April 1964 and hosted by Charles Collingwood , focused on modern culture and its historical origins , as a counterpoint to the " hard news " slant the '' CBS Reports '' emphasized . Other episodes in the series were devoted to topics such as Edgar Allan Poe , the Constitution of the United States , and the British music hall tradition . The series was nominated for " Outstanding Program Achievement in the Field of News Commentary or Public Affairs " at the 16th Primetime Emmy Awards in 1964

		ANSWER=Mussel Slough Tragedy
		GOLD_MENTION=
		CONTEXT=The Mussel Slough Tragedy was a dispute over land titles between settlers and the Southern Pacific Railroad ( SP ) that took place on May 11 , 1880 , on a farm located northwest of Hanford , California , in the central San Joaquin Valley , leaving seven people dead . Frank Norris ' 1901 novel , The Octopus : A Story of California , was inspired by this incident , as was W. C. Morrow 's 1882 novel Blood - Money . May Merrill Miller 's novel , First the Blade , includes a fictionalized account of the conflict . The exact history of the incident has been the source of some disagreement , largely because popular anti-railroad sentiment in the 1880s interpreted the incident as a clear example of corrupt and cold - blooded corporate greed . Muckraking journalists and anti-railroad activists glorified the settlers and used the events as evidence and justification for their anti-corporate crusades . The site of the episode is now registered as California Historical Landmark # 245 . A historical marker on the east side of 14th Avenue , 350yards ( 320m ) north of Elder Avenue , memorializes the site .

The bus continued forwards for 2.9 km until it collided with a guardrail on the left side . After the driver swerved the bus to the right , it then collided with the right guardrail , after which tourists on the bus from Dalian walked to the back door to escape , but the door was jammed by the guardrail broken in the crash and could only open 10 cm wide , making escape impossible . Afterwards , a gravel truck driver saw the fire and quickly notified a policeman surnamed Lin . Together , they attempted a rescue by breaking the bus windows but were not successful , and eventually the entire bus was consumed by the blaze , causing all 26 passengers to die . This was the most serious bus accident in Taiwan that occurred in 2016 , and also the most serious one since the 2010 Suhua Highway bus accident . BBC , The Guardian , the Wall Street Journal , NHK , Yomiuri Shimbun , CNN , the Daily Mirror , and various international media have made reports .

The conflict between left-wing and right-wing groups eventually resulted in a military intervention in September 1980 when General Kenan Evren led a coup d'état . According to Daniele Ganser , at the time of the coup , there were some 1,700 Grey Wolves organizations , with about 200,000 registered members and a million sympathizers . Following the 1980 coup the Grey Wolves and MHP were banned . Their activism was diminished . The nationalist view was that they were " used and then discarded " by higher powers

		ANSWER=Axis invasion of Yugoslavia
		GOLD_MENTION=
		CONTEXT=Poles are one of 17 constitutionally recognized ethnic minorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina . They arrived during the Austro - Hungarian rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina and settled mostly in the north of Bosnia proper , bringing new technology and skilled manpower . Their destiny was tied closely to that of the Ukrainian minority , with whom they joined the Yugoslav Resistance after the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia . After the Second World War , Bosnian Poles faced difficulties with establishing their rights as a minority as well as persecution by local population and remaining fascist collaborators . This forced a vast majority to answer the Polish government 's call for repatriation . There were around 30,000 Poles in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1930 , while their number today is estimated to be less than a thousand , with communities in the major cities of Sarajevo , Banja Luka , Zenica and Mostar .

		CONTEXT=In 1941 , Yugoslavia surrendered unconditionally to the Axis powers during World War II . Hungary occupied Vojvodina . In January 1942 , Moscovich 's father was a victim of the Novi Sad massacre . His father died at age 44 . In 1943 , Hungary started secret armistice negotiations with the Allied Powers which was discovered by Germany resulting in the German occupation of Vojvodina . Soon after , at the age of 17 , Moscovich was taken to the concentration camp at Auschwitz with his grandfather , grandmother and mother . His grandparents were immediately taken to the crematoria and were killed . While his mother stayed in Auschwitz , Moscovich was moved to Wustegiersdorf , one of the surrounding work camps , laying rail lines . In January 1945 , Auschwitz was evacuated and Moscovich along with 60,000 prisoners marched west to Bergen-Belsen . After only a few days , Moscovich volunteered for a selection of 500 volunteer prisoner workers . These volunteers were sent to clear the railway station in Hildesheim by dislodging the wagons to free the rails so they could be fixed and used for German transports . While there , several groups found food supplies including sugar , butter , and eggs . On March 22 , Hildesheim was bombed killing or wounding both prisoners and German guards . The volunteers were made to move the bodies for easier identification . They were then marched to the Hannover-Ahlem prison camp . The prisoners worked in an asbestos mine converting it into an ammunition depot safe from aerial attacks . Hannover-Ahlem was evacuated on April 6 , 1945 and Moscovich marched towards Bergen-Belsen again . Moscovich describes the last days in Bergen-Belsen as “ the ultimate in human misery , suffering , degradation , death and humiliation . ” He hid himself among a pile of dead bodies to avoid the Germans

		CONTEXT=The ceremony was held on a night other than Sunday for the first time since 1976 ( the 28th Primetime Emmy Awards were also staged on a Monday that year , May 17 ) . The ceremony 's unusual date — a Monday night in late August — was due to two factors , primary being NBC 's commitment to '' Sunday Night Football '' ; since acquiring the National Football League 's Sunday night game package in 2006 , NBC , when it is their turn in the four-network rotation to air the Primetime Emmy Awards , usually schedules the ceremony for the Sunday before Labor Day weekend , to avoid conflicts with '' SNF '' in mid-September ( when ABC , CBS , or Fox normally air the ceremony ) . NBC 's ideal date on the 2014 calendar for the ceremony ( Sunday , August 24 ) led to the other scheduling factor — MTV 's Video Music Awards , which were set for that night more than a year in advance ( and would be staged in the L.A. area as well , at The Forum in Inglewood ) . On January 28 , 2014 , rather than go head-to-head with the VMA 's , NBC announced that the ceremony would take place on Monday , August 25 . The move would allow NBC to commit to a preseason '' Sunday Night Football '' broadcast for the 24th ( a game between the Cincinnati Bengals and Arizona Cardinals ) ; it also ensured the tradition of staging the Primetime Emmy Awards the weekend after the Creative Arts Emmy Awards ( that ceremony was already set for August 16 )

		CONTEXT=On 4 October 2009 , Fred Halliday , Emeritus Professor of International Relations at the LSE and the School 's leading expert on the Middle East , wrote a memorandum to the LSE Council regarding the proposed cooperation with the Gaddafi Foundation . " I have repeatedly expressed reservations about formal educational and funding links with that country . " While those in favour of accepting the donation argued that " Libya is changing internally , " most informed observers agree that while some of the worst excesses for the moment have ceased , the rights of its people are badly protected . Libya " remains a country run by a secretive , erratic and corrupt elite . " Since 9/11 the Libyan government has reached compromises with the West on a number of issues , notably the Lockerbie bombing and nuclear weapons . Yet tactical changes in foreign policy are not sufficient for the purposes of evaluating political and academic links . There are also ways in which Libyan foreign policy has '' not '' changed : the country continues to call for the destruction of Israel ; Muammar Gaddafi recently called for the abolition of Switzerland , and he receives the leader of the Somali pirates operating off the Horn of Africa as honoured guests of state . Moreover , Libya 's handling of the Lockerbie bombing " has not been characterised by either consistency or clarity , " I have in the past , Halliday noted , defended accepting grants from authoritarian regimes such as the Gulf states , " but there should be clear limits on this , depending on the degree of political and human rights abuses perpetrated with them and on their ongoing foreign policy conduct . " Whitehall and the City are now happy to do business with Libya , but it does not follow that the LSE should do the same . Responsible leaders throughout the Middle East continue to express reservations regarding Libya , including " its more prominent ' liberal ' representatives . " We must remember , Halliday concluded , that the " liberal " wing within a regime such as Libya does not have the function of producing change but its role is instead " to reach compromises with internal hard-liners that serve to lessen external pressure . " A good case in point are the proposals LSE now is considering . It is , as LSE alumni in positions of responsibility in the region caution , " far too early for the School to take this step . " In 2009 , Human Rights Watch was allowed entry to Libya , via Saif al-Islam Gaddafi 's non-profit organization in order to gather facts about the human rights situation there . While HRW reported that there were concerns about the " repressive atmosphere , " they felt there were signs of " improvement " and Sarah Leah Whitson , director of HRW 's Middle East division said that one should not " underestimate the importance of the efforts made so far " by Gaddafi in the realm of human rights in Libya . She also wrote of her official visit that " the real impetus for the transformation rests squarely with a quasi-governmental organization , the Qaddafi Foundation for International Charities and Development " chaired by Gaddafi . She praised Gaddafi for establishing the country 's two semi-private newspapers , and said " it is impossible to underestimate the importance of the efforts made so far . Let 's hope this spring will last . " In January 2011 , HRW criticised other organisations as well as governments that had previously dealt with Gaddafi . HRW Business and Human Rights Director Arvind Ganesan condemned the London School of Economics ( LSE ) for allowing " abusive and corrupt officials or their families to launder their images in exchange for money " . This was later followed by Ganesen saying that " the London School of Economics did not act until Saif al-Islam 's father literally began to kill his own people " . According to NGO Monitor , this was despite the fact that David Held , Co-Director of LSE Global Governance , was partially influenced by Whitson 's remarks regarding her Libyan visit , referring to Saif al-Islam Gaddafi as a reformer

		CONTEXT=In early 2013 , Gosling announced that he was taking a break from acting , stating , " I 've lost perspective on what I 'm doing . I think it 's good for me to take a break and reassess why I 'm doing it and how I 'm doing it . And I think this is probably a good way to learn about that . " Gosling 's directorial debut '' Lost River '' competed in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival . The " fantasy noir " , written by Gosling , stars Christina Hendricks , Ben Mendelsohn , and Matt Smith . The film received largely unfavorable reviews . Peter Bradshaw of '' The Guardian '' found it " insufferably conceited " and remarked that Gosling had lost " any sense of proportion or humility . " Robbie Collin of '' The Telegraph '' described '' Lost River '' as " mind-bogglingly pleased with itself " , while '' Variety '' s Justin Chang dismissed the " derivative " film as a " train-wreck . " In 2015 , he played a bond salesman in the ensemble financial satire '' The Big Short '' , a Best Picture nominee at the 2016 Academy Awards .

" Peter Travers of '' Rolling Stone '' said : " Gosling , a virtuoso of verbal sleaze , talks directly to the camera , and he 's volcanically fierce and funny . " The following year , Gosling starred in the black comedy '' The Nice Guys '' , opposite Russell Crowe , and in Damien Chazelle 's musical '' La La Land '' , for which he won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and received his second Academy Award for Best Actor nomination . Robbie Collins took note of his chemistry with co-star Emma Stone and wrote , " Both stars are so attuned to each other ’s pace and flow that their repartee just seems to tumble out , perfectly formed . " It emerged as one of his most commercially successful films , with earnings of over $ 440 million against its $ 30 million budget
