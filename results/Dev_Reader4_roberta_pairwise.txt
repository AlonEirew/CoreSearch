QUERY_ANSWERS={'massive flood', '1977 flood', 'Johnstown Flood of 1977'}
QUERY_CONTEXT=The flood was preceded by rains from March 9 that did not stop until March 22 , 1936 . The storms brought warmer 50 °F ( 10 °C ) weather that was a cause of one stage of flooding and the continuous rains a second cause of flooding . The natural run-off of 1 to 3 inches ( 2.5 to 7.5 cm ) was far surpassed by the deluge of from 10 to 30 inches ( 25 to 75 cm ) of water in the region . The flood came before pending flood control legislation was enacted or any significant flood control measures implemented . The narrowness of the valleys and encroachment of buildings on the river banks contributed to record flooding . By the time nightfall came one-third of the city was under of water and by the time flooding was over twenty-five people lost their lives . The damages , estimated at $ 43 million , made it the worst flood since the flood of 1889 and the event is chronicled at the Johnstown Flood Museum After the flood , sweeping nationwide flood control laws were enacted and from 1938 to 1943 Johnstown saw many projects completed . These measures gave the people the feeling that the area was now " flood free " , and it was touted as such until the flood of 1977

		CONTEXT=In early August 2012 , Israel 's National Security Council 's counter-terrorism bureau renewed its travel advisory against visiting the Sinai Peninsula , due to information on potential terrorist attacks against tourists , including kidnappings . The warning may have been due to Hamas ' release of Abu Walid al-Maqdisi , a Salafi leader of an al-Qaeda-affiliated terrorist group , responsible for three bombings in Dahab in 2006 , and which is believed to have close ties with terror cells operating in the Sinai Peninsula . The following day , the United States also issued a travel warning to Americans to " take precautions in travel to the Sinai " and warned that " overland travel from Israel to the Sinai in particular is strongly discouraged . " Over the weekend prior to the attack on the border , various intelligence reports reaching the IDF 's Southern Command warned of an impending attack . Specific information regarding the time , target , and location of the attack could not be ascertained . Still , Southern Command Maj.-Gen . Tal Russo prepared his troops in case of an attack . Armored , Engineering , and Infantry soldiers were placed on high alert while the Israeli Air Force was deployed in the area as reinforcement .

QUERY_CONTEXT=In the 1959 review for '' Sight & Sound '' , David Vaughan calls '' Gigi '' " an elegant film " with a " cultivated visual taste which is everywhere apparent " . He summarises that " while '' Gigi '' does not represent a revival of the MGM musical in its heyday , it is a welcome extension of latter-day musical style in its adult subject-matter and its avoidance of spectacle made vulgar by emphasis on size . " He praises Minnelli 's talent for " the delicious amorality of the anecdote , but also the honesty and irony of its telling which have become foreign to the American cinema . " Vaughan points out " Chevalier 's practiced but irresistible charm as one of the film 's greatest assets " as well as " the brilliant high-comedy playing of Isabel Jeans , who as Aunt Alicia consummately portrays the distinction and beauty of a retired aristocrat of the '' demimonde '' . " Bosley Crowther of '' The New York Times '' called it " a musical film that bears such a basic resemblance to '' My Fair Lady '' that the authors may want to sue themselves " . He added , " But do n't think this point of resemblance is made in criticism of the film , for '' Gigi '' is a charming entertainment that can stand on its own two legs . It is not only a charming comprehension of the spicy confection of Colette , but it is also a lovely and lyrical enlargement upon that story 's flavored mood and atmosphere … Vincente Minnelli has marshaled a cast to give a set of performances that , for quality and harmony , are superb . " Abel Green of '' Variety '' called the film " 100 % escapist fare " and predicted it " is destined for a global box-office mop-up " . He added , " Alan Jay Lerner 's libretto is tailor-made for an inspired casting job for all principals , and Fritz Loewe 's tunes ( to Lerner 's lyrics ) already vie with and suggest their memorable '' My Fair Lady '' score … Miss Caron is completely captivating and convincing in the title role … Skillful casting , performance and presentation have endowed realism to the sum total … Director Minnelli 's good taste in keeping it in bounds and the general sound judgment of all concerned … distinguishes this Arthur Freed independent production . The Metrocolor rates recognition for its soft pastels under Joseph Ruttenberg 's lensing ; the Beaton costumes , sets and general production design are vivid physical assets at first sight . The skillful integration of words-and-music with the plot motivation makes this '' Gigi '' a very fair lady indeed as a boxoffice entry . " '' Time Out New York '' said , " The dominating creative contribution comes from Minnelli and Cecil Beaton … The combination of these two visual elitists is really too much — it 's like a meal consisting of cheesecake , and one quickly longs for something solid and vulgar to weigh things down . No doubt inspired by the finicky , claustrophobic sets and bric-à-brac , the cast tries ( with unfortunate success ) to be more French than the French , especially Chevalier . The exception is Gingold , who inhabits , as always , a world of her own . " '' TV Guide '' rated the film 3 ½ out of five stars , calling it " Overbaked but enjoyable , and a banquet for the eyes , thanks to the visual wonder of the Minnelli-Beaton teaming … Caron … leads the cast in a contest to see who can be the most French . The winner is Chevalier , in a performance that makes one feel as if you 're gagging on pastry … Perhaps if the sweetness of '' Gigi '' was contrasted with elements of honest vulgarity , the picture could balance itself out … Ten minutes into the movie , you 've resolved the plot and are left to wallow in lovely frou-frou . The film makes wonderful use of the usual Parisian landmarks , and benefits from extraordinary period costumes and sets . " '' Gigi '' won a record-breaking nine Academy Awards ( at the 1959 Oscars ceremony ) ; however , this record only lasted for one year , as '' Ben-Hur '' broke this record the following year with 11 Oscars . In tribute to '' Gigi '' s domination of the Oscars , the MGM switchboard answered calls the following day with " M-Gigi-M " . '' Gigi '' , eventually along with 1987 's '' The Last Emperor '' , held the record as the film ( s ) with the most Academy Award wins in every category in which it was nominated , until 2003 's '' The Lord of the Rings : The Return of the King '' broke the record at the 2004 Oscars ceremony with 11 Oscar nominations and 11 Oscar wins

It 's a gilded cheese ball , pushing exhilaration to the point of exhaustion .

		ANSWER=Montreal Massacre
		GOLD_MENTION=Montreal massacre
		CONTEXT=Adam Thrasher argued that the " Take Back the Night " marches cause polarization in gender relations , since women discourage men from participating . Thrasher said , as paraphrased by Dan Lazin of '' The Gateway '' , that " unthinking men may be incited to further hatred towards women . " Thrasher argued that while the strips criticize " the ideas of some hard-core feminists , " they are not against all women . Thrasher added that " The reason I did it is because it 's such a taboo to make fun of violence against women , against Take Back the Night . " Thrasher also stated that " When I drew up the cartoon , I was n't thinking about Marc Lepine and the Montreal massacre which was a crime against humanity , I think , more than a crime against women . " A Saturday October 25 , 1997 , editorial of '' The Globe and Mail '' argued that the actions against Thrasher were censorship and that " the instinct to block the juvenile humour was more disturbing than the juvenalia itself . " The '' Alberta Report '' said in 1997 that " '' Space Moose '' is a festival of caricatured scatology , violence , perversion , irreligion and even pedophilia . It has stimulated outrage before , but in five years the university had never suppressed the strip , despite lampoons of University institutions , Trekkies , the mentally retarded , and Christians . Only one group , it seems , has the clout to make the university turn censor . " In response to Thrasher 's argument that the marches could polarize gender relations and that the comic had a different message than perceived , Gretchen Hess said that the intent of the strip was not easily discernible and that the effect of the strip should be considered in addition to the intent . Linda Trimble argued that " t he pretty direct message of the cartoon was ' It 's open season on feminists . Kill all the women . " Joyce Green , a University of Regina political science professor who was another complainant , argued that " I do n't see any difference between the Montreal Massacre and the cartoon . " Green added that the group had complained about the strips " not because we 're paranoid but because we 're terrified . " Shannon Sampert , a political science student who was another one of the complainants , said that she was not surprised that the appeal went in favor of Thrasher . She believed that additional students would try to take the course of action that Thrasher took , and she believed that Feminists would cause an outcry against the appeals

		CONTEXT=On 8 January 1896 , in conversation with L.A. Tollemache , Gladstone explained that : " I am not so much afraid of Democracy or of Science as of the love of money .

On 13 January , Gladstone claimed he had strong Conservative instincts and that " In all matters of custom and tradition , even the Tories look upon me as the chief Conservative that is " . On 15 January Gladstone wrote to James Bryce , describing himself as " a dead man , one fundamentally a Peel – Cobden man " . In 1896 , in his last noteworthy speech , he denounced Armenian massacres by Ottomans in a talk delivered at Liverpool . On 2 January 1897 , Gladstone wrote to Francis Hirst on being unable to draft a preface to a book on liberalism : " I venture on assuring you that I regard the design formed by you and your friends with sincere interest , and in particular wish well to all the efforts you may make on behalf of individual freedom and independence as opposed to what is termed Collectivism "

		ANSWER=1945 Sétif massacre
		GOLD_MENTION=Sétif massacre
		CONTEXT='' The Philadelphia Inquirer '' published a review by Carrie Rickey , who wrote , " Under the obvious influence of Francis Ford Coppola , Bouchareb frames his shadow-ridden guerrilla heroes as the Algerian counterparts of the Corleones " , referring to the American film '' The Godfather '' , and further that '' Outside the Law '' owes " an enormous debt to Jean-Pierre Melville 's '' Army of Shadows '' ( 1969 ) , about French resistance fighters one-minded in their goal to subvert Nazis " . Rickey wrote , " Bouchareb is sometimes a little too one-minded : His movie might have been richer emotionally had he written scenes showing the characters ' domestic lives and not strictly their professional spheres . " Stephen Holden of '' The New York Times '' called '' Outside the Law '' a " didactic , unashamedly manipulative film " , and also saw parallels to '' The Godfather '' and '' Army of Shadows '' : " Those are mighty shoes to fill , and as powerful and well-made as it is , '' Outside the Law '' is too schematic and single-minded to lodge itself in your mind as a fully realized cinematic epic . Its few female characters are sketchy at best . " Before the film premiered , already it was met by political controversy and nationalist-oriented criticism in France . Lionnel Luca , a member of the National Assembly for the UMP , appealed for a review by the Defence Historical Service as soon as he heard about the project . Guy Pervillé deplored the inevitable acceptance by moviegoers of the film as representing historical truth . The Defence Historical Service claimed that " the errors and anachronisms are so many and so gross that they can be identified by any historian ... The numerous improbabilities present in the scenario show that the writing of the latter was not preceded by a serious historical study . " The center of the controversy was the depiction of the 1945 Sétif massacre early in the film . The report elaborated , " The director wants to suggest that on May 8 , 1945 , Muslims in Sétif were blindly massacred by Europeans , whereas it 's the contrary that transpired . ... A ll historians agree that ... Europeans lashed out against Muslims in response to Muslims massacring Europeans . " This reaction is at odds with mainstream history , which concluded that , after restoring order in the town , French military and police then carried out a series of reprisals and summary executions of native civilians . Before even seeing the film , Luca also criticized the decision to give public funding to a film which he considered " anti-French " . Mustapha Orif , one of the film 's co-producers , responded to the accusations and defended the film 's portrayal of the massacre . " Rachid Bouchareb interviewed many people , witnesses and historians . From this point of view , I do not think at all that he has deviated from historical reality , " he said

		CONTEXT=Standing behind the mantra " No one likes us . We do n't care , " The Show has a history of approaching , if not crossing the line on occasion . The first controversial act by The Show was during a 2010 game against former Mountain West Conference rival BYU , a school that is owned and operated by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ( LDS Church , or Mormons ) . For this home game , several dozen Show members dressed up in Mormon missionary apparel , wearing white button-down shirts , black ties , and bike helmets . This move was criticized by '' Sports Illustrated '' writer Seth Davis . He is described the stunt as a " Totally classless move by several dozen San Diego State students who dressed up as Mormon missionaries to mock BYU when the Cougars came to town on Saturday night . Riding the opposition is fine , but there are a few things that are off-limits , and religion is of them . " Near the end of the game , with SDSU losing , fans started chanting " You 're still Mormon . " During this game , one sign came under fire for being over the line . It said , " Which wife gave you mono ? " This was referencing both Jimmer Fredette 's recent bout with mononucleosis and polygamy in early LDS history . The BYU player saw the sign and laughed it off . The next season , both teams ranked in the top 10 in the nation during their meeting at Viejas . Weeks before the game , an SDSU student tried to get in Jimmer 's head by creating a Facebook event that invited students to “ Poke Jimmer Fredette ’s girlfriend because Jimmer ca n’t poke her for himself . ” In the description , students were told the mission was to " disrupt , upset , distract and irritate ( the ) opponent . ” More than 7,000 people were invited to the event , which had a picture of Jimmer 's girlfriend ( now wife ) Whitney Wonnacott and her Facebook profile . Other students started selling " I poked Jimmer 's girlfriend " shirts . These shirts were banned for the game , yet a few students managed to sneak in with them . For the game , hundreds of Show members dressed up in Mormon gear , despite a letter emailed to students from coach Fisher , where he said , " We know that the energy and enthusiasm brought by The Show is what makes Viejas Arena one of the toughest home courts in the country . It is important to remember that when you are in the student section , you represent something greater than yourself . You represent San Diego State ... We can not cross the line into topics that are out of bounds and distasteful , particularly making fun of one ’s religion . " During this game , there were many signs and posters referencing Mormonism , including " Hi mom ( s ) , " " Jimmer Freddette is a false idol , " and " Aztec basketball is my religion . " During the 2012 Mountain West Conference Tournament , members of The Show sent out tweets from The Show 's Twitter account that made fun of a camera shot of UNLV 's legendary basketball coach , Jerry Tarkanian . Some of the tweets sent out included “ Will Tark be alive by Saturday to see us storm the court for a 3rd straight year ? ” “ Tarkanian makes Tom Ables ( SDSU ’s dedicated senior citizen fan ) looks like Channing Tatum . ” and “ Tarkanian looks like dog ( bleep ) . ” '' San Diego Union-Tribune '' writer Don Norcross responded by writing an article saying the tweets were sent in poor taste

		CONTEXT=Critical opinion regarding the film has been overwhelmingly positive . '' The Village Voice '' critic J. Hoberman , who in 1981 included the film in his list of the ten best films commercially released in the United States during that year , more recently wrote that the film is one " of the richest avant-garde features of the 1970s " and praised its " winning combination of sexual frankness and visual wit , " while another critic , Dennis Schwartz , wrote that the " film 's beauty is derived from its sexual frankness and playfully drawn out intimate relationship scenes , witty use of photography , and its originality as it breaks free of conventional unities of body , space and time . Export skillfully edits montage and integrates video , still photography , and performance art with elements from Cubism , Surrealism , Dada and avant-garde cinema . " '' Artforum '' noted in November 1980 that " w atching their scenes together , we realize how seldom , if ever before , the details of sexual intimacy have been shown in film from the point of view from a woman . Export privileges rupture over unity and never settles for one-dimensional solutions " and it was called one " of the most original films in this year 's exposition " and a " tour de force of cinematic invention " grounded in the director 's " fresh and intelligent sensibility , characteristically self-referential . Her visual resources include mirrors , still photography , video , dance , and films within the film , all employed with a bold and surprising inventiveness " by the catalogue notes of the 1978 Los Angeles International Film Exposition . Similarly , critic Alison Butler wrote that the " film is a witty and visually brilliant essay on gender and experience , culture and environment " and program notes used by the San Francisco Cinematheque during a screening quote critic Amy Taubin as opining that the film " makes you reconsider what you and everyone else is doing — in life and in art " and critic Steve Anker underscoring that it is an important " crossover film " combining " avant-garde and theatrical sensibilities , made during the mid-1970s . It chronicles the nightmarish breakdown of a fashion photographer as she confronts her waning identity and security as a career woman ; blending narrative experimentation , fantasy , fact and theoretical critique , it has enormous impact on independent features which followed it . " PopMatters noted that the film has " enough originality to nag at patient viewers and get at least partially under our skin " and critic Michael Atkinson wrote that it is a " weird , restless , beguilingly offbeat bit of dreamwork . " The film was presented for the first time at the Berlin International Film Festival in 1977 , it has won a Special Jury Prize at the Venice Film Festival and was recently called " seminal " during a screening at a repertory cinema , " a strong and humoristic showdown " at another and " a sonically-complex , montage-rich , darkly funny and uriniferous cornerstone of avant-garde cinema " during a screening at a New York University class . Critic Peter Hajek wrote in the Austrian newspaper '' Kurier '' that " Valie Export presents this psychopanoptic view of the present in solid , striking images and often in unexpected humorous passages . " Critic Chris Holmlund , author of the scholarly article " Feminist Makeovers : The Celluloid Surgery of Valie Export and Su Friedrich , " referred to '' Invisible Adversaries '' as a feminist version of '' Invasion of the Body Snatchers '' , noted that the film includes references to famous paintings and to '' Un Chien Andalou '' , and wrote that therefore it " is visually rick , entertaining , striking , but also demanding . " A few reviews , however , were negative . For example , London 's '' Time Out '' wrote about the film that it is " n ot unlike '' W.R. : Mysteries of the Organism '' " and that it will " probably age as badly " and a reviewer for '' The Heights '' wrote that " I was expecting a great feminist work here , but got mediocrity . I can not recommend that you see this film , " though he nevertheless praised the film as a " cornucopia of video spectacle in which Export delights , confounds and amuses the audience with her antics .

		CONTEXT=, the film holds a rating of 75 % on Rotten Tomatoes based on 28 reviews , with an average rating of 6.47 / 10 . The website 's critical consensus reads : " Abel Ferrara 's 1995 horror/suspense experiment blends urban vampire adventure with philosophical analysis to create a smart , idiosyncratic and undeniably odd take on the genre . " Kevin Thomas of the '' Los Angeles Times '' praised Taylor 's performance , and added : " Although Ferrara dares to be intellectual in a manner virtually unique in commercial American cinema , he nevertheless does n't forget how to entertain in the gory , bravura manner associated with him . Although it undeniably helps , you do n't have to know your Heidegger from Hamburger Helper to enjoy '' The Addiction '' as a grisly yet unusual thriller of the supernatural . " '' The Washington Post '' s Hal Hinson was less laudatory of Taylor 's performance , writing that she " seems less distinctive here than she has been in past roles . " However , he praised Walken 's performance , though summarized the film as " serious and passionate ; Ferrara 's conviction , too , is unquestionable . However , when he flashes images of historic atrocities of both the distant and recent past — Nazi death camps , the war dead in Bosnia — his ideas come across as shallow and banal . Also , inserting scenes of real-life horror into what is essentially a glorified genre exercise may strike some as the essence of bad taste . " Caryn James of '' The New York Times '' expressed a similar sentiment , noting " When the film connects Kathleen 's struggle to resist evil to My Lai and the Holocaust , those comparisons are exploitative in a way that even a genre-bending film ca n't get away with . " Stephen Hunter of '' The Baltimore Sun '' praised Taylor for portraying Kathleen " with dour , sexless intensity , " and deemed the film " far sexier than '' Interview with the Vampire '' and far deadlier than the campy '' Nadja '' ... It 's extremely disturbing , a graduate - level movie for advanced students in either of three subjects : cinema , philosophy and debauchery . " The film was nominated for the Golden Bear award at the 45th Berlin International Film Festival where it won the Blue Angel Award . Lili Taylor won the Sant Jordi Award for Best Foreign Actress . The film received Best Actress ( Taylor ) , Best Film ( Abel Ferrara ) and Special Mention Award ( Walken ) at the Málaga International Week of Fantastic Cinema .

In previous years , countries that received a top 10 placing were automatically granted a spot in the next year 's final without having to compete in a semi-final , but for 2008 , the EBU changed the automatic qualification regulations so that all countries except the " Big 4 " ( France , Germany , Spain , and the United Kingdom ) and host country , would have to pass through one of two semi-finals . The EBU split up countries with a friendly voting history into separate semi-finals , to give a better chance for other countries to win . Greece and Cyprus had often been accused of favoring each other , with each awarding the other the maximum number of points ( twelve ) at the previous contest . On January 28 , 2008 , the EBU held a special draw which determined that Greece would be in '' Semi-final 1 '' held on May 20 , 2008 in Belgrade , Serbia ; Cyprus was subsequently placed in the second semi-final

In previous years , countries that received a top 10 placing were automatically granted a spot in the next year 's final without having to compete in a semi-final , but for 2008 , the EBU changed the automatic qualification regulations so that all countries except the " Big 4 " ( France , Germany , Spain , and the United Kingdom ) and host country , would have to pass through one of two semi-finals . The EBU split up countries with a friendly voting history into separate semi-finals , to give a better chance for other countries to win . Greece and Cyprus had often been accused of favoring each other , with each awarding the other the maximum number of points ( twelve ) at the previous contest . On January 28 , 2008 , the EBU held a special draw which determined that Greece would be in '' Semi-final 1 '' held on May 20 , 2008 in Belgrade , Serbia ; Cyprus was subsequently placed in the second semi-final

		CONTEXT='' Mind Body & Soul '' received generally positive reviews from music critics . At Metacritic , which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications , the album received an average score of 64 , based on 11 reviews . Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic noted that , compared to '' The Soul Sessions '' , " c ertain songs are a little brighter and a little more radio-ready than before , there 's a more pronounced hip-hop vibe to some beats , and she sounds a little more like a diva this time around — not enough to alienate older fans , but enough to win some new ones . The album has a seductive , sultry feel ; there 's some genuine grit to the rhythms , yet it 's all wrapped up in a production that 's smooth as silk . " John Murphy of '' musicOMH '' raved that " t his is a terrific album , and on this basis Joss Stone is going to be a household name for years and years to come . " Darryl Sterdan of Jam ! wrote that " even if her contributions were limited to lyrics and melodies , she still comes through with flying colours , displaying a knack for sharp hooks and catchy choruses . " Dan Gennoe of Yahoo! Music UK commented that songs like " Right to Be Wrong " , " Jet Lag " and " Killing Time " " confirm that not only can she deliver pain and passion like a lover three times her age , she can write it like one too . " He continued : " There 's not a bad song here , but there are some that never make it out of the rootsy background . " '' Billboard '' critic Michael Paoletta stated that Stone " continues to reinvent soul music , injecting a very classic sound with contemporary sass and verve " , while noting that " t hroughout , '' that '' voice reigns supreme . " '' The Guardian '' s Caroline Sullivan believed that " this record is best seen as a stepping stone by which she should n't be judged too exactingly . " She also praised Stone 's " ripening " voice , saying it is " foxier " than on '' The Soul Sessions '' . At '' Blender '' magazine , Robert Christgau opined that " this album 's compromise with the teen-pop divahood she was groomed for will feel like a bid for authenticity . Stone 's infatuation with band grooves provides relief from the radio-ready synthesizers and compressors . " Dimitri Ehrlich of '' Vibe '' called the album " deeply refreshing " , adding that " t here 's nothing new here ... but if your ears are inured to the dense , overly polished production of contemporary R&B , Stone 's simplicity and rawness will come as a revelation . " Laura Sinagra of '' Rolling Stone '' wrote , " As on her last album , tasteful retro organs and wah-wah dominate this batch of originals " and named " Spoiled " one of the album 's " strongest moments " , but felt that songs like " Do n't Cha Wan na Ride " and " You Had Me " are " more Destiny 's Child than yesterday 's blues " . In a mixed review , David Browne of '' Entertainment Weekly '' stated , " Save for a mild foray into reggae and a stab at power balladry , the tracks are monotonously midtempo , supper-club soul . " At the 2005 Brit Awards , Stone won the awards for British Female Solo Artist and British Urban Act , and was nominated for British Breakthrough Act , becoming the youngest recipient of a Brit Award at age 17 . That same year , Stone received three nominations at the 47th Annual Grammy Awards , including Best New Artist , Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for " You Had Me " and Best Pop Vocal Album for '' Mind Body & Soul '' . The album earned Stone a nomination for International Newcomer of the Year at Germany 's Echo Awards in 2005

		CONTEXT='' Mind Body & Soul '' received generally positive reviews from music critics . At Metacritic , which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications , the album received an average score of 64 , based on 11 reviews . Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic noted that , compared to '' The Soul Sessions '' , " c ertain songs are a little brighter and a little more radio-ready than before , there 's a more pronounced hip-hop vibe to some beats , and she sounds a little more like a diva this time around — not enough to alienate older fans , but enough to win some new ones . The album has a seductive , sultry feel ; there 's some genuine grit to the rhythms , yet it 's all wrapped up in a production that 's smooth as silk . " John Murphy of '' musicOMH '' raved that " t his is a terrific album , and on this basis Joss Stone is going to be a household name for years and years to come . " Darryl Sterdan of Jam ! wrote that " even if her contributions were limited to lyrics and melodies , she still comes through with flying colours , displaying a knack for sharp hooks and catchy choruses . " Dan Gennoe of Yahoo! Music UK commented that songs like " Right to Be Wrong " , " Jet Lag " and " Killing Time " " confirm that not only can she deliver pain and passion like a lover three times her age , she can write it like one too . " He continued : " There 's not a bad song here , but there are some that never make it out of the rootsy background . " '' Billboard '' critic Michael Paoletta stated that Stone " continues to reinvent soul music , injecting a very classic sound with contemporary sass and verve " , while noting that " t hroughout , '' that '' voice reigns supreme . " '' The Guardian '' s Caroline Sullivan believed that " this record is best seen as a stepping stone by which she should n't be judged too exactingly . " She also praised Stone 's " ripening " voice , saying it is " foxier " than on '' The Soul Sessions '' . At '' Blender '' magazine , Robert Christgau opined that " this album 's compromise with the teen-pop divahood she was groomed for will feel like a bid for authenticity . Stone 's infatuation with band grooves provides relief from the radio-ready synthesizers and compressors . " Dimitri Ehrlich of '' Vibe '' called the album " deeply refreshing " , adding that " t here 's nothing new here ... but if your ears are inured to the dense , overly polished production of contemporary R&B , Stone 's simplicity and rawness will come as a revelation . " Laura Sinagra of '' Rolling Stone '' wrote , " As on her last album , tasteful retro organs and wah-wah dominate this batch of originals " and named " Spoiled " one of the album 's " strongest moments " , but felt that songs like " Do n't Cha Wan na Ride " and " You Had Me " are " more Destiny 's Child than yesterday 's blues " . In a mixed review , David Browne of '' Entertainment Weekly '' stated , " Save for a mild foray into reggae and a stab at power balladry , the tracks are monotonously midtempo , supper-club soul . " At the 2005 Brit Awards , Stone won the awards for British Female Solo Artist and British Urban Act , and was nominated for British Breakthrough Act , becoming the youngest recipient of a Brit Award at age 17 . That same year , Stone received three nominations at the 47th Annual Grammy Awards , including Best New Artist , Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for " You Had Me " and Best Pop Vocal Album for '' Mind Body & Soul '' . The album earned Stone a nomination for International Newcomer of the Year at Germany 's Echo Awards in 2005

QUERY_CONTEXT=Duane Allman created the idea of having two lead guitarists , which was inspired by Curtis Mayfield ; " he wanted the bass , keyboards , and second guitar to form patterns behind the solo rather than just comping , " said Allman . Their style and incorporation of guitar harmonies was very influential on later musicians . " The pair also had a wide range of complementary techniques , often forming intricate , interlocking patterns with each other and with the bassist , Berry Oakley , setting the stage for dramatic flights of improvised melodies . " Dickey Betts ' playing was very melody-based ; " My style is just a little too smooth and round to play the blues stuff straight , because I 'm such a melody guy that even when I 'm playing the blues , I go for melody first , " he said . His listening of country and string bluegrass growing up influenced this considerably : " I played mandolin , ukulele , and fiddle before I ever touched a guitar , which may be where a lot of the major keys I play come from . " He later characterized their style as " question and answer , anticipation and conclusion , " which involved allowing each musician 's downbeat to arrive in a different spot , while also keeping consideration of the bass guitar lines . The group also held an improvisational approach to live performances , which connected the band with jam band culture . " Jazz and blues musicians have been doing this for decades , but I think they really brought that sense that anyone onstage can inspire anyone else at any given time to rock music , " said Haynes . " We sure did n't set out to be a " jam band " but those long jams just emanated from within the band , because we did n't want to just play three minutes and be over , " said Allman . '' Rolling Stone '' referred to the group as " without question the first great jam band , and they took the jam to heights that it had not previously reached . " The Allman Brothers Band were considerably influential within the Southern United States . Their arrival on the musical scene paved the way for several other notable Southern rock bands — among those Lynyrd Skynyrd , the Marshall Tucker Band and Wet Willie — to achieve commercial success , and also " almost single-handedly " made Capricorn Records into " a major independent label . " Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top , writing for '' Rolling Stone '' , wrote that the group " defined the best of every music from the American South in that time . They were the best of all of us . " He went on to call the band " a true brotherhood of players — one that went beyond race and ego . It was a thing of beauty . " The band 's extended popularity through heavy touring in the early 1990s created a new generation of fans , one that viewed the Allmans as pioneers of " latter-day collegiate jam rock . " AllMusic praised the band 's history : " they went from being America 's single most influential band to a shell of their former self trading on past glories , to reach the 21st century resurrected as one of the most respected rock acts of their era . " In 2012 , an official historic marker was erected on the site of the July 1970 Second Atlanta International Pop Festival near Byron , Georgia . The Allman Brothers Band had played two sets at the festival , which was a significant event in their career . The marker text reads , in part : " Over thirty musical acts performed , including ... Macon 's Allman Brothers Band on their launching pad to national fame . " Official sponsors of the marker included the Georgia Allman Brothers Band Association , The Allman Brothers Band Museum at the Big House , and '' Hittin ' the Note '' . In 2003 , the band released a recording of their festival opening and closing performances , '' Live at the Atlanta International Pop Festival : July 3 & 5 , 1970 ''

QUERY_CONTEXT=In a positive review for '' Cuepoint '' , Robert Christgau argued that while Azalea may never demonstrate a powerful , soulful , or attractively melodic delivery , her " striving Australian-Atlantan cadence " is original and carries every song . He deemed ' ' The New Classic '' " plenty authentic -- and damn good to boot " while dismissing Azalea 's media naysayers : " predictably , the songs where she expresses wonderment that ' Impossible Is Nothing ' are more relatable than the ones where she flaunts her liquid assets . But the ones where she pledges to keep on striving are more relatable than that , because striving is built into her flow itself . That 's what her complexity is about . " Phil Johnson from '' The Independent '' called it " an instantly engaging showcase of the 23-year-old Aussie 's talents – poppy without diluting her fierce-flowing charisma . " Kellan Miller of '' XXL '' said despite some poor songs near the end of the record , it is " a persuasive indicator that Iggy Azalea will be around for the long haul . " '' The New Classic '' was named one of the best hip-hop albums of the year by '' XXL '' on a list published on 30 June 2014 , adding that " the album proved to a gang of skepts who doubted Iggy 's controversial style from the start that she was more than capable of making hip-hop tracks with a pop appeal . " It was placed at number twenty-five on Digital Spy 's top albums of 2014 and listed among Fuse 's 40 best albums of 2014 . The album won the Breakthrough Artist Release award at the 2014 ARIA Music Awards and Favorite Rap/Hip-Hop Album at the 2014 American Music Awards , beating out Drake 's '' Nothing Was the Same '' and Eminem 's '' The Marshall Mathers LP 2 '' . It received a nomination for Best Rap Album at the 57th Grammy Awards . The album was also up for Top Rap Album at the 2015 Billboard Music Awards

QUERY_ANSWERS={'Caltavuturo massacre'}
QUERY_CONTEXT=According to many scholars , the name and origin of the town are traced back to the period of Arab rule . According to Ibn al-Athir ( '' The Complete History '' , VII .370.5 – 7 ) , in AH 268 ( 881/82 CE ) , the Aghlabid commander Abū Ṯawr was defeated by the Byzantines ( probably commanded by the '' strategos '' Mosilikes ) and his was army annihilated , with only seven men surviving . The locality was later named in Arabic '' Qalʿat Abī Ṯawr '' ( " Castle of Abū Ṯawr " ) , which is the origin of the modern name . Others instead maintain that the name derives from the Arabic word " qal ' at " ( fortress ) and the Sicilian " vuturu " ( vulture ) meaning of " fortress of vultures . " The town existed under Byzantine rule pre Arab conquest as Aziz Ahmad in “ A Islamic History of Sicily ” ( edinburgh university press 1975 ) states that in 852 Abbas raided Caltavuturo in the northern part of the Island and took many prisoners who were sold as slaves , The town was the site of the so-called Caltavuturo massacre on 20 January 1893 , when local authorities killed 13 and wounded 21 peasants that had occupied communal land that they claimed was theirs

QUERY_CONTEXT=Prior to and during the Civil War , Pennsylvania was a divided state . Although Pennsylvania had outlawed slavery , many conservative Pennsylvanians believed that the federal government should not interfere with the institution of slavery . One such individual was Democrat James Buchanan , the last pre-Civil War president . Buchanan 's party had generally won presidential and gubernatorial elections in Pennsylvania . However , the nascent Republican Party 's first convention took place in Philadelphia , and the 1860 elections saw the Republican Party win the state 's presidential vote and the governor 's office . After the failure of the Crittenden Compromise , the secession of the South , and the Battle of Fort Sumter , the Civil War began with Pennsylvania as a key member of the Union . Despite the Republican victory the 1860 election , Democrats remained powerful in the state , and several " copperheads " called for peace during the war . The Democrats re-took control of the state legislature in the 1862 election , but incumbent Republican Governor Andrew Curtin retained control of the governorship in 1863 . In the 1864 election , President Lincoln narrowly defeated Pennsylvania native George B. McClellan for the state 's electoral votes

QUERY_CONTEXT=The first official Republican convention in Illinois was held on May 29 , 1856 , in Bloomington . Chairman John M. Palmer was elected convention president after his opening address . Nine vice presidents and five secretaries were then elected . The convention nominated Bissell for governor with Francis Hoffmann as lieutenant governor , Ozias M. Hatch for secretary of state , Jesse K. Dubois as auditor , and James Miller as treasurer . Hoffmann was found to be ineligible for his position due to a residency requirement , and John Wood was nominated in his place . The following resolutions defining the party platform were approved : Resolved , That foregoing all former differences of opinions upon other questions , we pledge ourselves to unite in opposition to the present administration and to the party which upholds and supports it and to use all honorable and constitutional means to wrest the Government from the unworthy hands which now control it and to bring it back in its administration to the principles and practices of Washington , Jefferson and their great and good compatriots of the Revolution . Resolved , That foregoing all former differences of opinions upon other questions , we pledge ourselves to unite in opposition to the present administration of the Government ; that under the Constitution Congress possesses the power to prohibit slavery in the Territories ; and that , whilst we will maintain all constitutional rights of the South , we also hold that justice , humanity , the principles of freedom as expressed in our Declaration of Independence and our national constitution , and the purity and perpetuity of our Government require that that power shall be exerted to prevent the extension of slavery into territory heretofore free . Resolved , That the repeal of the Missouri Compromise was unwise and injurious ; an open and aggravated violation of the plighted faith of the States , and that the attempt of the present administration to force slavery into Kansas against the known wishes of the legal voters of that Territory is an arbitrary and tyrannous violation of the rights of the people to govern themselves , and that we will strive by all constitutional means to secure to Kansas and Nebraska the legal guaranty against slavery of which they were deprived at the cost of the violation of the plighted faith of the nation . Resolved , That we are devoted to the Union and will , to the last extremity , defend it against the efforts now being made by the dis-unionists of this administration to compass its dissolution , and that we will support the Constitution of the United States , in all its provisions regarding it , as the sacred bond of our Union and the only safeguard for the preservation of the rights of ourselves and our posterity . Resolved , That we are in favor of the immediate admission of Kansas as a member of this Confederacy under the constitution adopted by the people of said Territory . Resolved , That the spirit of our institutions as well as the Constitution of our country , guarantees the liberty of conscience as well as political freedom , and that we will proscribe no one by legislation or otherwise on account of religious opinions , or in consequence of place of birth . Lincoln delivered the closing address . The speech was purportedly so captivating that no reporter made a record of it . The address has become known as Lincoln 's Lost Speech .

QUERY_ANSWERS={'Mudan incident', 'were massacred'}
QUERY_CONTEXT=And Japan was eager to take every opportunity . In 1869 they took advantage of the defeat of the rebels of the Republic of Ezo to incorporate definitely the island of Hokkaido to Japan . For centuries , Japan viewed the Ryukyu Islands as one of its provinces . In 1871 the Mudan incident happened : cannibal Taiwanese aborigines murdered 54 Ryūkyūan sailors that had their ship shipwrecked . At that time the Ryukyu Islands were claimed by both Qing China and Japan , and the Japanese interpreted the incident as an attack on their citizens . They took steps to bring the islands in their jurisdiction : in 1872 the Japanese Ryukyu Domain was declared , and in 1874 a retaliatory incursion to Taiwan was sent , which was a success . The success of this expedition emboldened the Japanese : not even the Americans could defeat the Taiwanese cannibals in the Formosa Expedition of 1867 . Very few gave it much thought at the time , but this was the first move in the Japanese expansionism series . Japan occupied Taiwan for the rest of 1874 and then left owing to Chinese pressures , but in 1879 it finally annexed the Ryukyu Islands . In 1875 Qing China sent a 300-men force to subdue the Taiwanese cannibals , but unlike the Japanese the Chinese were routed , ambushed and 250 of their men were killed ; the failure of this expedition exposed once more the failure of Qing China to exert effective control in Taiwan , and acted as another incentive for the Japanese to annex Taiwan . Eventually , the spoils for winning the First Sino-Japanese War in 1894 included Taiwan

		CONTEXT=He established himself in Chicago , where in the great fire of 1871 he lost everything he possessed . In 1875 , he moved to New York City , finding work on the '' Century '' ( then '' Scribners '' ) magazine . Cole was associated with the magazine for 40 years as a pioneer craftsman of wood engraving . He immediately attracted attention by his unusual facility and his sympathetic interpretation of illustrations and pictures , and his publishers sent him abroad in 1883 to engrave a set of blocks after the old masters in the European galleries . These achieved for him a brilliant success . His reproductions of Italian , Dutch , Spanish , Flemish and English pictures were published in book form with appreciative notes by the engraver himself . '' Old Dutch and Flemish Masters '' was one of the books that Cole had contributed his wood engravings . Though the advent of new mechanical processes had rendered wood engraving almost a lost art and left practically no demand for the work of such craftsmen , Mr Cole was thus enabled to continue his work , and became one of the foremost contemporary masters of wood engraving . He received a medal of the first class at the Paris Exhibition of 1900 , and the only grand prize given for wood engraving at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition at St Louis , Missouri , in 1904 . In 1906 he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate Academician , and became a full Academician in 1908 . His son , Alphaeus Philemon Cole , was a noted portraitist who is also today recognized as having been the worlds oldest verified living man at the time of his death

		CONTEXT=Following the release of the MHRC report , Matas accused MHRC vice-chairwoman Yvonne Peters of taking a contradictory position , stating that : " So what they 're saying is that a full investigation is warranted even when there 's no evidence , as long as the accusation is within the jurisdiction of the board . There 's a lot of problems with this . What basically happened is that Siddiqui heard a rumour . She makes a complaint , as a result of which the commission goes on a five-year fishing expedition . They do n't find anything . We 're co-operating with them . And then they dismiss the complaint . That 's not a proper procedure , in my view . " Matas also criticized the procedures of the MHRC , stating that they will " take an allegation , without evidence , and just run with it to see if it 's true . " The previous year , Matas in a submission in a Moon Report on Internet hate speech , Matas charged that Canada 's human rights commissions have demonstrated " a disastrous combination of investigative zeal and substantive ignorance . " Although Matas stated that he does not believe Siddiqui acted in bad faith , he added that : " The people who run these procedures have to have a more objective viewpoint than the people who make the complaint . " In July 2009 , B'nai Brith Canada issued a press release denouncing Carleton University for hiring Hassan Diab , who was alleged by French authorities to have been responsible for the 1980 Paris synagogue bombing .

		ANSWER=1945 Sétif massacre
		GOLD_MENTION=Sétif massacre
		CONTEXT='' The Philadelphia Inquirer '' published a review by Carrie Rickey , who wrote , " Under the obvious influence of Francis Ford Coppola , Bouchareb frames his shadow-ridden guerrilla heroes as the Algerian counterparts of the Corleones " , referring to the American film '' The Godfather '' , and further that '' Outside the Law '' owes " an enormous debt to Jean-Pierre Melville 's '' Army of Shadows '' ( 1969 ) , about French resistance fighters one-minded in their goal to subvert Nazis " . Rickey wrote , " Bouchareb is sometimes a little too one-minded : His movie might have been richer emotionally had he written scenes showing the characters ' domestic lives and not strictly their professional spheres . " Stephen Holden of '' The New York Times '' called '' Outside the Law '' a " didactic , unashamedly manipulative film " , and also saw parallels to '' The Godfather '' and '' Army of Shadows '' : " Those are mighty shoes to fill , and as powerful and well-made as it is , '' Outside the Law '' is too schematic and single-minded to lodge itself in your mind as a fully realized cinematic epic . Its few female characters are sketchy at best . " Before the film premiered , already it was met by political controversy and nationalist-oriented criticism in France . Lionnel Luca , a member of the National Assembly for the UMP , appealed for a review by the Defence Historical Service as soon as he heard about the project . Guy Pervillé deplored the inevitable acceptance by moviegoers of the film as representing historical truth . The Defence Historical Service claimed that " the errors and anachronisms are so many and so gross that they can be identified by any historian ... The numerous improbabilities present in the scenario show that the writing of the latter was not preceded by a serious historical study . " The center of the controversy was the depiction of the 1945 Sétif massacre early in the film . The report elaborated , " The director wants to suggest that on May 8 , 1945 , Muslims in Sétif were blindly massacred by Europeans , whereas it 's the contrary that transpired . ... A ll historians agree that ... Europeans lashed out against Muslims in response to Muslims massacring Europeans . " This reaction is at odds with mainstream history , which concluded that , after restoring order in the town , French military and police then carried out a series of reprisals and summary executions of native civilians . Before even seeing the film , Luca also criticized the decision to give public funding to a film which he considered " anti-French " . Mustapha Orif , one of the film 's co-producers , responded to the accusations and defended the film 's portrayal of the massacre . " Rachid Bouchareb interviewed many people , witnesses and historians . From this point of view , I do not think at all that he has deviated from historical reality , " he said

		CONTEXT=Oliver Sava of '' The A.V. Club '' awarded the episode an " A " , calling it " a fascinating psychological horror story about a boy shedding everything that defines him in order to move on to the next phase of his life . " Sava noted that while the episode was humorous , much of the comedy was undercut by the tragic and distressing nature of Finn 's story . Andrew Tran of Overmental argued that " the episode ... dissects vividly that bottomless feeling of midlife wanderlust ... not the road-trippy , running-through-the-fields kind but rather the life-map-disappearing-in-your-hands , what-the-hell-is-next kind . " Tran contended that , through the use of video game tropes , explores the idea that life is ultimately unpredictable that there " is no map that you can make for yourself ( or that anyone can give you ) that can account for everything you ’re going to encounter " . " The Hall of Egress " has been highly lauded by the show 's production staff , with series creator Pendleton Ward in particular naming it as one of his favorites . According to the crew , " It was just so thoughtfully done . " At the 68th Primetime Emmy Awards in 2016 , " The Hall of Egress " was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Short-format Animation . The episode lost to the '' Robot Chicken '' episode " Robot Chicken Christmas Special : The X-Mas United "

		CONTEXT=Originally , the two artists recorded their vocals for the song together with Jerkins and his production team at the Record One Studios in North Hollywood . However , the joint recording was felt to be a failure so Monica re-recorded her vocals separately at the DARP Studios in Atlanta , Georgia with longtime contributor Dallas Austin and turned the song into a more mature pop sound . ( Thus , Austin would later share the main production credit alongside Jerkins . ) Though both Brandy and Monica repeatedly denied the song reflected any actual rivalry between them , tabloids began writing the opposite . There were claims that Monica was upset when Brandy performed the song solo on '' The Tonight Show with Jay Leno '' , and Brandy was reportedly miffed when Monica opted to take the name of the duet for the title of her second album . Following reports that the pair came to blows during a rehearsal for a performance at the MTV Video Music Awards in September 1998 , talk of the rivalry became so loud that the singers ' managers released a joint statement in which they called the press out for its " disturbing behavior " and called the " ongoing negativity as totally unfair . " As with " The Boy Is Mine , " Jerkins later claimed that both singers " did n’t get along " during production and that he and Dexter Simmons remixed the track seven times to keep everything even . In a 2012 interview with WZMX , Monica spoke about her past relationship with Brandy : " We were young . We could barely stay in the room with each other . By no means was it jealousy or envy . She and I are polar opposites and instead of embracing that , we used our differences as reasons not to be amongst each other . " On June 6 , 1998 , " The Boy Is Mine " became both singers ' first number-one hit and fifth top ten entry for each on the US '' Billboard '' Hot 100 . Bouncing from number 23 to the top spot , it became the second song in the history of the chart to ascend directly to number-one from a previous position beneath the Top 20 , following The Beatles and the 27 – 1 leap of their single " Ca n't Buy Me Love " in April 1964 . In addition , it was the first number-one collaboration between solo women since 1979 's two-weeks number-one run of " No More Tears ( Enough Is Enough ) , " performed by Barbra Streisand and Donna Summer . The same week , " The Boy Is Mine " also moved to number-one on the Hot R&B Singles , Hot 100 Singles Sales and Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales charts . Within the first month of its purchasable release the song went on to sell 605,000 units . It spent thirteen consecutive weeks atop the '' Billboard '' Hot 100 and has since been ranked among the longest running number-one songs in US chart history , sharing this record with Boyz II Men 's " End of the Road " ( 1992 ) . " The Boy Is Mine " was the best-selling single of 1998 in the US , with sales of 2,591,000 , with the second best-selling single being Next 's " Too Close " . It was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) and was ranked eighth on '' Billboard '' s Decade-End Charts .

The group also vowed more attacks until Kamilia was released . Two months later , on New Year 's Eve 2011 , a suicide bomber killed 23 Coptic Christians in the 2011 Alexandria bombing

		GOLD_MENTION=2009 Christmas Day attempted airplane bombing
		CONTEXT=Jasser has said that he and his family have helped build a number of small mosques in different cities using locally raised funds , and at times encountering , but always overcoming local opposition . In 2010 Jasser strongly opposed the building of the Park51 project , a 13-story Islamic community center and mosque two blocks from the World Trade Center site , which is also known as Ground Zero . He said he was concerned that the funding of the $ 100 million project might be coming from foreign Islamist sources , and also said : " Ground Zero is purely about being American . It can never be about being Muslim . " Jasser believes acts of Islamic terrorism are rooted in the ideology of political Islam or Islamism . He has expressed the opinion that the 2009 Christmas Day attempted airplane bombing , the 2009 Fort Hood shooting , and the 2010 Times Square car bombing attempt have not prodded the United States into the appropriate action , but rather have resulted in politically correct denial by U.S. government authorities , and inaction by most American Muslims . He believes that even the Bush administration took inadequate measures against Islamism in America . He says the U.S. needs to provide alternatives for Muslim youth and promote reformist groups . In his television appearances , Jasser has claimed that 3 to 5 percent of U.S. Muslims are militant and 30 to 40 percent do not believe in separation of mosque and state . He also states that he believes many Western Muslim imams are too timid in their response to Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant seemingly both criticizing but also sympathizing with its goal of a caliphate stating " Clearly , the majority of the mosques in the United States are led by imams who are Islamists — who believe that in Muslim-majority countries that the state should be identified as an Islamic state . " Jasser is an outspoken supporter of Israel and believes that Muslim organizations and leaders need to be held to a litmus test to see whether they recognize Israel as a state . Jasser and a group of American Muslims founded the nonprofit American Islamic Forum for Democracy ( AIFD ) in 2003 with the goal of demonstrating the compatibility of Islam with democracy and American values . Jasser is the group 's president and chief spokesman . The AIFD supports separation of religion and state , religious pluralism , equality of the sexes , the unconditional recognition of Israel , and the creation of an independent Palestine " on the current ' occupied territories . ' " The organization rejects terrorism and any justification for it
