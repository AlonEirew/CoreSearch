		CONTEXT=On 4 October 2009 , Fred Halliday , Emeritus Professor of International Relations at the LSE and the School 's leading expert on the Middle East , wrote a memorandum to the LSE Council regarding the proposed cooperation with the Gaddafi Foundation . " I have repeatedly expressed reservations about formal educational and funding links with that country . " While those in favour of accepting the donation argued that " Libya is changing internally , " most informed observers agree that while some of the worst excesses for the moment have ceased , the rights of its people are badly protected . Libya " remains a country run by a secretive , erratic and corrupt elite . " Since 9/11 the Libyan government has reached compromises with the West on a number of issues , notably the Lockerbie bombing and nuclear weapons . Yet tactical changes in foreign policy are not sufficient for the purposes of evaluating political and academic links . There are also ways in which Libyan foreign policy has '' not '' changed : the country continues to call for the destruction of Israel ; Muammar Gaddafi recently called for the abolition of Switzerland , and he receives the leader of the Somali pirates operating off the Horn of Africa as honoured guests of state . Moreover , Libya 's handling of the Lockerbie bombing " has not been characterised by either consistency or clarity , " I have in the past , Halliday noted , defended accepting grants from authoritarian regimes such as the Gulf states , " but there should be clear limits on this , depending on the degree of political and human rights abuses perpetrated with them and on their ongoing foreign policy conduct . " Whitehall and the City are now happy to do business with Libya , but it does not follow that the LSE should do the same . Responsible leaders throughout the Middle East continue to express reservations regarding Libya , including " its more prominent ' liberal ' representatives . " We must remember , Halliday concluded , that the " liberal " wing within a regime such as Libya does not have the function of producing change but its role is instead " to reach compromises with internal hard-liners that serve to lessen external pressure . " A good case in point are the proposals LSE now is considering . It is , as LSE alumni in positions of responsibility in the region caution , " far too early for the School to take this step . " In 2009 , Human Rights Watch was allowed entry to Libya , via Saif al-Islam Gaddafi 's non-profit organization in order to gather facts about the human rights situation there . While HRW reported that there were concerns about the " repressive atmosphere , " they felt there were signs of " improvement " and Sarah Leah Whitson , director of HRW 's Middle East division said that one should not " underestimate the importance of the efforts made so far " by Gaddafi in the realm of human rights in Libya . She also wrote of her official visit that " the real impetus for the transformation rests squarely with a quasi-governmental organization , the Qaddafi Foundation for International Charities and Development " chaired by Gaddafi . She praised Gaddafi for establishing the country 's two semi-private newspapers , and said " it is impossible to underestimate the importance of the efforts made so far . Let 's hope this spring will last . " In January 2011 , HRW criticised other organisations as well as governments that had previously dealt with Gaddafi . HRW Business and Human Rights Director Arvind Ganesan condemned the London School of Economics ( LSE ) for allowing " abusive and corrupt officials or their families to launder their images in exchange for money " . This was later followed by Ganesen saying that " the London School of Economics did not act until Saif al-Islam 's father literally began to kill his own people " . According to NGO Monitor , this was despite the fact that David Held , Co-Director of LSE Global Governance , was partially influenced by Whitson 's remarks regarding her Libyan visit , referring to Saif al-Islam Gaddafi as a reformer

" We must remember , Halliday concluded , that the " liberal " wing within a regime such as Libya does not have the function of producing change but its role is instead " to reach compromises with internal hard-liners that serve to lessen external pressure . " A good case in point are the proposals LSE now is considering . It is , as LSE alumni in positions of responsibility in the region caution , " far too early for the School to take this step . " In 2009 , Human Rights Watch was allowed entry to Libya , via Saif al-Islam Gaddafi 's non-profit organization in order to gather facts about the human rights situation there . While HRW reported that there were concerns about the " repressive atmosphere , " they felt there were signs of " improvement " and Sarah Leah Whitson , director of HRW 's Middle East division said that one should not " underestimate the importance of the efforts made so far " by Gaddafi in the realm of human rights in Libya . She also wrote of her official visit that " the real impetus for the transformation rests squarely with a quasi-governmental organization , the Qaddafi Foundation for International Charities and Development " chaired by Gaddafi . She praised Gaddafi for establishing the country 's two semi-private newspapers , and said " it is impossible to underestimate the importance of the efforts made so far . Let 's hope this spring will last . " In January 2011 , HRW criticised other organisations as well as governments that had previously dealt with Gaddafi . HRW Business and Human Rights Director Arvind Ganesan condemned the London School of Economics ( LSE ) for allowing " abusive and corrupt officials or their families to launder their images in exchange for money " . This was later followed by Ganesen saying that " the London School of Economics did not act until Saif al-Islam 's father literally began to kill his own people " . According to NGO Monitor , this was despite the fact that David Held , Co-Director of LSE Global Governance , was partially influenced by Whitson 's remarks regarding her Libyan visit , referring to Saif al-Islam Gaddafi as a reformer

		ANSWER=World Trade Center bombings of 1993
		GOLD_MENTION=World Trade Center bombings of 1993
		CONTEXT=The book portrays Husseini , a member of an important Jerusalem Arab family , as an anti-Semite and a key figure in infusing the modern Arab world with anti-Semitic attitudes . It asserts that Husseini 's views were the '' casus belli '' for virtually all modern Middle Eastern terrorism - " an unbroken chain of terror from Adolf Hitler , Haj Amin al-Husseini , Sayyid Qutb , and Yasser Arafat to Hamas ' founder and spiritual leader , Sheikh Ahmad Yassin , Sheikh Omar Abd al-Rahman , and Ramzi Yousef , who planned the World Trade Center bombings of 1993 , to Osama bin Laden and Mohamed Atta , to Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh , the Pakistani Muslim terrorist who planned the kidnapping and murder of U.S. journalist Daniel Pearl , and to Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad . " '' Icon of Evil '' received a strongly critical response from some reviewers . Simon Maxwell Apter , writing in the '' San Francisco Chronicle '' , describes the book as " cursory and apparently hastily written " and " bereft of any nuance or counterargument " for its insistence on blaming the mufti for " anything and everything Islamist " . Acknowledging that Husseini had indeed played an important role in inciting anti-Jewish violence , Apter concludes that '' Icon of Evil '' presents a distorted simplification of history : " To claim that '' Icon of Evil '' paints a black-and-white view of history does the book too much justice ; it 's an entirely black - or entirely white - story told here . " The Israeli historian Tom Segev , writing in the '' New York Times '' , criticized the book as " of little scholarly value , and it may be potentially harmful to Middle East peace prospects . " Segev highlights the authors ' consistent failure to provide solid evidence , for instance asserting on the basis of rumors that Husseini owed his position to a " passionate homosexual relationship " with a senior British official , and the degree to which the authors " blur the terms radical Islam , anti-Semitism and Nazism " and group together numerous Arabs and Muslims as " disciples of the mufti . " He concludes : " T he book is worth noticing , as it belongs to a genre of popular Arab-bashing that is often believed to be ' good for Israel . ' It is not . The suggestion that Israel 's enemies are Nazis , or the Nazis ' heirs , is apt to discourage any fair compromise with the Palestinians , and that is bad for Israel . " Benny Morris , an Israeli historian , commends the authors for " putting their finger on important affinities " but criticises the quality of their work , describing ' Icon of Evil " as a " bad book " : " they decidedly over-reach , and , given the poverty of their scholarship , they often fail to persuade , leaving the reader with the bad taste of propaganda . " He comments that they " suffer not from pedantry but from overtly propagandistic aims . They are constantly beating an ideological drum . Their adjectives are a giveaway . Every anti-Semite or anti-Semitic text is ' virulent ' or ' notorious . ' " The book " abounds with errors of fact " , and Morris describes as " obscene " the authors ' digression into a counterfactual history in which the Nazis won the Second World War and exterminated the Jews of Palestine with Husseini 's assistance . Despite this , Morris allows that " much of what the book says is soberingly truthful and to the point " James Srodes of '' The Washington Times '' describes '' Icon of Evil '' , as " another attempt to take a valid avenue for historical exploration and hype its sales " by drawing questionable links between Islamism and Hitler . Srodes comments that Husseini 's story " is important enough without embroidering it with swastikas " , noting the role that Husseini played in fomenting anti-Jewish riots and murders in British-ruled Palestine . However , he criticizes the authors ' rendering of the story as " shameful hype " that " merely confuses the larger story ... by try ing to draw a direct line from Adolf Hitler to al-Husseini and then to his distant cousin Yasser Arafat , let alone to Saddam Hussein . " '' Kirkus Reviews '' is similarly critical , noting that although the authors had done extensive archival research " their book is not a piece of sophisticated scholarship " and takes " reflexively pro-Israel positions " . The book starts out as " a n insightful examination of a rarely studied aspect of World War II — the collaboration of Islamic political parties and Middle East regimes with the Nazis — but quickly evolves into a brief for the neoconservative worldview . " The authors present " questionable broad-brush analysis " and " more speculation than is usually found in history books "

		CONTEXT=On 4 October 2009 , Fred Halliday , Emeritus Professor of International Relations at the LSE and the School 's leading expert on the Middle East , wrote a memorandum to the LSE Council regarding the proposed cooperation with the Gaddafi Foundation . " I have repeatedly expressed reservations about formal educational and funding links with that country . " While those in favour of accepting the donation argued that " Libya is changing internally , " most informed observers agree that while some of the worst excesses for the moment have ceased , the rights of its people are badly protected . Libya " remains a country run by a secretive , erratic and corrupt elite . " Since 9/11 the Libyan government has reached compromises with the West on a number of issues , notably the Lockerbie bombing and nuclear weapons . Yet tactical changes in foreign policy are not sufficient for the purposes of evaluating political and academic links . There are also ways in which Libyan foreign policy has '' not '' changed : the country continues to call for the destruction of Israel ; Muammar Gaddafi recently called for the abolition of Switzerland , and he receives the leader of the Somali pirates operating off the Horn of Africa as honoured guests of state . Moreover , Libya 's handling of the Lockerbie bombing " has not been characterised by either consistency or clarity , " I have in the past , Halliday noted , defended accepting grants from authoritarian regimes such as the Gulf states , " but there should be clear limits on this , depending on the degree of political and human rights abuses perpetrated with them and on their ongoing foreign policy conduct . " Whitehall and the City are now happy to do business with Libya , but it does not follow that the LSE should do the same . Responsible leaders throughout the Middle East continue to express reservations regarding Libya , including " its more prominent ' liberal ' representatives . " We must remember , Halliday concluded , that the " liberal " wing within a regime such as Libya does not have the function of producing change but its role is instead " to reach compromises with internal hard-liners that serve to lessen external pressure .

There are also ways in which Libyan foreign policy has '' not '' changed : the country continues to call for the destruction of Israel ; Muammar Gaddafi recently called for the abolition of Switzerland , and he receives the leader of the Somali pirates operating off the Horn of Africa as honoured guests of state . Moreover , Libya 's handling of the Lockerbie bombing " has not been characterised by either consistency or clarity , " I have in the past , Halliday noted , defended accepting grants from authoritarian regimes such as the Gulf states , " but there should be clear limits on this , depending on the degree of political and human rights abuses perpetrated with them and on their ongoing foreign policy conduct .

		ANSWER=Lockerbie bombing
		GOLD_MENTION=the Lockerbie bombing
		CONTEXT=On 4 October 2009 , Fred Halliday , Emeritus Professor of International Relations at the LSE and the School 's leading expert on the Middle East , wrote a memorandum to the LSE Council regarding the proposed cooperation with the Gaddafi Foundation . " I have repeatedly expressed reservations about formal educational and funding links with that country . " While those in favour of accepting the donation argued that " Libya is changing internally , " most informed observers agree that while some of the worst excesses for the moment have ceased , the rights of its people are badly protected . Libya " remains a country run by a secretive , erratic and corrupt elite . " Since 9/11 the Libyan government has reached compromises with the West on a number of issues , notably the Lockerbie bombing and nuclear weapons . Yet tactical changes in foreign policy are not sufficient for the purposes of evaluating political and academic links . There are also ways in which Libyan foreign policy has '' not '' changed : the country continues to call for the destruction of Israel ; Muammar Gaddafi recently called for the abolition of Switzerland , and he receives the leader of the Somali pirates operating off the Horn of Africa as honoured guests of state . Moreover , Libya 's handling of the Lockerbie bombing " has not been characterised by either consistency or clarity , " I have in the past , Halliday noted , defended accepting grants from authoritarian regimes such as the Gulf states , " but there should be clear limits on this , depending on the degree of political and human rights abuses perpetrated with them and on their ongoing foreign policy conduct . " Whitehall and the City are now happy to do business with Libya , but it does not follow that the LSE should do the same . Responsible leaders throughout the Middle East continue to express reservations regarding Libya , including " its more prominent ' liberal ' representatives . " We must remember , Halliday concluded , that the " liberal " wing within a regime such as Libya does not have the function of producing change but its role is instead " to reach compromises with internal hard-liners that serve to lessen external pressure . " A good case in point are the proposals LSE now is considering . It is , as LSE alumni in positions of responsibility in the region caution , " far too early for the School to take this step . " In 2009 , Human Rights Watch was allowed entry to Libya , via Saif al-Islam Gaddafi 's non-profit organization in order to gather facts about the human rights situation there . While HRW reported that there were concerns about the " repressive atmosphere , " they felt there were signs of " improvement " and Sarah Leah Whitson , director of HRW 's Middle East division said that one should not " underestimate the importance of the efforts made so far " by Gaddafi in the realm of human rights in Libya . She also wrote of her official visit that " the real impetus for the transformation rests squarely with a quasi-governmental organization , the Qaddafi Foundation for International Charities and Development " chaired by Gaddafi . She praised Gaddafi for establishing the country 's two semi-private newspapers , and said " it is impossible to underestimate the importance of the efforts made so far . Let 's hope this spring will last . " In January 2011 , HRW criticised other organisations as well as governments that had previously dealt with Gaddafi . HRW Business and Human Rights Director Arvind Ganesan condemned the London School of Economics ( LSE ) for allowing " abusive and corrupt officials or their families to launder their images in exchange for money " . This was later followed by Ganesen saying that " the London School of Economics did not act until Saif al-Islam 's father literally began to kill his own people " . According to NGO Monitor , this was despite the fact that David Held , Co-Director of LSE Global Governance , was partially influenced by Whitson 's remarks regarding her Libyan visit , referring to Saif al-Islam Gaddafi as a reformer

		CONTEXT=Targeted Killings : Law and Morality in an Asymmetrical World is a non-fiction compilation book about targeted killing edited by Claire Finkelstein , Jens David Ohlin , and Andrew Altman . It was published by Oxford University Press in 2012 . The book grew out of contributions by the authors to a conference in April 2011 at the University of Pennsylvania Law School . Targeted Killings features eighteen essays in five sections arranged by topic . The work argues that after the 11 September attacks by Al - Qaeda in 2001 , the United States and other countries began to see the tactic of targeted killing differently . The practice of targeted killing had previously been accepted in situations of self - defence in military settings ; after 11 September 2001 it was used to kill non-combatants and those not directly involved in a particular armed force .

Bakri then stated that he had become a Salafi Muslim . Media outlets and British Muslims criticised him for his open support for various international jihadist organisations . On 13 September 2001 , Bakri told the '' Daily Mail '' , " When I first heard about the September 11 , 2001 attacks , there was some initial delight about such an attack . I received a phone call and said , ' Oh , wow , the United States has come under attack . ' It was exciting . " According to '' The Times '' , Bakri was left alone by British law prior to July 2005 despite actions such as an issuing a fatwa " containing a death threat against President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan " because : Bakri , who acts as al-Muhajiroun 's spiritual leader , insisted that his followers obey a " covenant of security " which , while encouraging terror abroad , forbade them from carrying out attacks in Britain . But " the authorities may have been lulled into a false sense of security " , because the covenant was not permanent . In November 2004 Bakri disbanded Al-Muhajiroun , saying that " all Muslims should unite together against a hostile West . " Three months later Bakri said this " covenant of security " was no longer in force having been violated by the British government . " Experts note , " according to the Times , that the July London bombings followed " four months later "

		CONTEXT=Under Yitzhak Rabin , the Israeli government proposed closing down the settlement at Tel Rumeida after the Cave of the Patriarchs massacre . Far-right rabbis moved to block evacuation of the settlements by issuing an Halakhic ruling against removal of settlements in Eretz Israel . The collective influence of the settlers and their Rabbis , in what one scholar has called , ' one of the most effective mobilization efforts in settler history , ' persuaded Prime Minister Rabin to back down . The Dir al-Arba ' in mosque , where Hebronite Palestinians had prayed until the mid-1990s , was declared a closed military zone , and converted into a synagogue , renamed by settlers '' Tomb of Ruth and Jesse '' , and thenceforth all access to it by Muslims was forbidden ostensibly for security reasons . According to Karin Aggestam , attempts to convert the mosque into a Jewish national shrine , including painting its door blue , are in violation of the Hebron Protocol , which committed both Israel and Palestine to preserving and protecting the historic character of the city without harm or changes . During the Al-Aqsa Intifada , the Jewish settlement came under regular fire from Palestinian militants

		CONTEXT=Although Greece had been granted a spot in the 2008 final because of its seventh-place finish at the Eurovision Song Contest 2007 , it had to compete in a semi-final for the first time since 2004 because of new rules put into effect by the European Broadcasting Union ( EBU ) . In previous years , countries that received a top 10 placing were automatically granted a spot in the next year 's final without having to compete in a semi-final , but for 2008 , the EBU changed the automatic qualification regulations so that all countries except the " Big 4 " ( France , Germany , Spain , and the United Kingdom ) and host country , would have to pass through one of two semi-finals . The EBU split up countries with a friendly voting history into separate semi-finals , to give a better chance for other countries to win . Greece and Cyprus had often been accused of favoring each other , with each awarding the other the maximum number of points ( twelve ) at the previous contest . On January 28 , 2008 , the EBU held a special draw which determined that Greece would be in '' Semi-final 1 '' held on May 20 , 2008 in Belgrade , Serbia ; Cyprus was subsequently placed in the second semi-final

		CONTEXT=Although Greece had been granted a spot in the 2008 final because of its seventh-place finish at the Eurovision Song Contest 2007 , it had to compete in a semi-final for the first time since 2004 because of new rules put into effect by the European Broadcasting Union ( EBU ) . In previous years , countries that received a top 10 placing were automatically granted a spot in the next year 's final without having to compete in a semi-final , but for 2008 , the EBU changed the automatic qualification regulations so that all countries except the " Big 4 " ( France , Germany , Spain , and the United Kingdom ) and host country , would have to pass through one of two semi-finals . The EBU split up countries with a friendly voting history into separate semi-finals , to give a better chance for other countries to win . Greece and Cyprus had often been accused of favoring each other , with each awarding the other the maximum number of points ( twelve ) at the previous contest . On January 28 , 2008 , the EBU held a special draw which determined that Greece would be in '' Semi-final 1 '' held on May 20 , 2008 in Belgrade , Serbia ; Cyprus was subsequently placed in the second semi-final

		CONTEXT=Nambassa significantly expanded the concept of multiple open air staging , all running simultaneously at the one event . Out of the first 1978 three-day festival , the requirement of a second stage grew from the need to expand the entertainment program because of the resounding feedback from local performers and artists wanting to play at Nambassa . This became the " Aerial Railway " , a second fully operational stage with sound , lighting and management . Aerial Railway absorbed the overflow of performers from the Main Stage , and also acted as a venue for spontaneous performances or raves . This second option was integral to the Nambassa philosophy of promoting local music and arts . Although the Miami Pop Festival in December 1968 featured two simultaneous ' main ' stages , most of the early U.S. and European rock festivals , including Woodstock festival , Monterey Pop Festival and Isle of Wight Festival were predominantly single stage productions . The Nambassa 1978 festival had three stages ; 1979 saw this expanded to four ( including workshop stages ) , and the 1981 5-day celebration heralded five separate sound and lighting venues , all running at the same time . In 1981 , " Aerial Railway " was replaced with the " Open Air Theatre " and " Woozlebub " for children . The multiple staging concepts seem to be finally making a comeback in the 21st century as seen at the recent Big Day Out and Glastonbury festivals

		CONTEXT=Sürgün or verb form sürmek ( to displace ) was a practice within the Ottoman Empire that entailed the movement of a large group of people from one region to another , often a form of forced migration imposed by state policy or international authority .

The practice was also used to enforce population exchanges such as the Balkan population exchanges in 1913 and the periodic exchanges between the new Republic of Turkey and Greece in 1923 .

He also hinted at the necessity for European combination to resist American competition

		ANSWER=Distomo massacre
		GOLD_MENTION=Distomo massacre
		CONTEXT=Operation Steinadler ( 3 – 13 July 1944 ) was the last counter-insurgency operation carried out by German forces in Macedonia . Although wide in its scope it ultimately failed to achieve its objectives as ELAS fighters successfully evaded the German patrols , returning to their hideouts once the operation was over . The civilian population thus became the main target for Axis reprisals . Shortly afterwards the German 1st Mountain Division and the 4th SS Polizei Panzergrenadier Division departed from the country , while in August Army Group E declared Greece a war zone . German shops and cultural institutions were closed , while civilians and older member of the army , secret police and SS were evacuated . Under Adolf Hitler 's orders the Wehrmacht adopted the policy of total war , in response to the rise of ELAS subversive activity which had hampered the summer harvest in areas still controlled by the collaborationist government . Army Group E 's staff deemed the preceding Distomo massacre and 1 May 1944 Kaisariani executions as excessive and even damaging to the image of the occupational authorities . The staff stressed the need to arrest insurgents rather than resorting to the collective punishment of civilians . Nevertheless , those orders were disregarded and atrocities continued unhindered . Between June and August , ELAS attacks led to the death of 30 German soldiers , 14 were wounded and 9 more were missing in action . German reprisals in their turn included the execution of 254 people

		ANSWER=1945 Sétif massacre
		GOLD_MENTION=Sétif massacre
		CONTEXT='' The Philadelphia Inquirer '' published a review by Carrie Rickey , who wrote , " Under the obvious influence of Francis Ford Coppola , Bouchareb frames his shadow-ridden guerrilla heroes as the Algerian counterparts of the Corleones " , referring to the American film '' The Godfather '' , and further that '' Outside the Law '' owes " an enormous debt to Jean-Pierre Melville 's '' Army of Shadows '' ( 1969 ) , about French resistance fighters one-minded in their goal to subvert Nazis " . Rickey wrote , " Bouchareb is sometimes a little too one-minded : His movie might have been richer emotionally had he written scenes showing the characters ' domestic lives and not strictly their professional spheres . " Stephen Holden of '' The New York Times '' called '' Outside the Law '' a " didactic , unashamedly manipulative film " , and also saw parallels to '' The Godfather '' and '' Army of Shadows '' : " Those are mighty shoes to fill , and as powerful and well-made as it is , '' Outside the Law '' is too schematic and single-minded to lodge itself in your mind as a fully realized cinematic epic . Its few female characters are sketchy at best . " Before the film premiered , already it was met by political controversy and nationalist-oriented criticism in France . Lionnel Luca , a member of the National Assembly for the UMP , appealed for a review by the Defence Historical Service as soon as he heard about the project . Guy Pervillé deplored the inevitable acceptance by moviegoers of the film as representing historical truth . The Defence Historical Service claimed that " the errors and anachronisms are so many and so gross that they can be identified by any historian ... The numerous improbabilities present in the scenario show that the writing of the latter was not preceded by a serious historical study . " The center of the controversy was the depiction of the 1945 Sétif massacre early in the film . The report elaborated , " The director wants to suggest that on May 8 , 1945 , Muslims in Sétif were blindly massacred by Europeans , whereas it 's the contrary that transpired . ... A ll historians agree that ... Europeans lashed out against Muslims in response to Muslims massacring Europeans . " This reaction is at odds with mainstream history , which concluded that , after restoring order in the town , French military and police then carried out a series of reprisals and summary executions of native civilians . Before even seeing the film , Luca also criticized the decision to give public funding to a film which he considered " anti-French " . Mustapha Orif , one of the film 's co-producers , responded to the accusations and defended the film 's portrayal of the massacre . " Rachid Bouchareb interviewed many people , witnesses and historians . From this point of view , I do not think at all that he has deviated from historical reality , " he said

		GOLD_MENTION=assassination of President Abraham Lincoln
		CONTEXT=The poem , written in free verse in 206 lines , uses many of the literary techniques associated with the pastoral elegy . It was written in the summer of 1865 during a period of profound national mourning in the aftermath of the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln on April 14 , 1865 . Despite the poem being an elegy to the fallen president , Whitman neither mentions Lincoln by name nor discusses the circumstances of his death . Instead , Whitman uses a series of rural and natural imagery including the symbols of the lilacs , a drooping star in the western sky ( Venus ) , and the hermit thrush , and employs the traditional progression of the pastoral elegy in moving from grief toward an acceptance and knowledge of death . The poem also addresses the pity of war through imagery vaguely referencing the American Civil War ( 1861 – 1865 ) which ended only days before the assassination

		ANSWER=occultation event
		GOLD_MENTION=
		CONTEXT=In the field of astronomy the term chord typically refers to a line crossing an object which is formed during an occultation event . By taking accurate measurements of the start and end times of the event , in conjunction with the known location of the observer and the object 's orbit , the length of the chord can be determined giving an indication of the size of the occulting object . By combining observations made from several different locations , multiple chords crossing the occulting object can be determined giving a more accurate shape and size model . This technique of using multiple observers during the same event has been used to derive more sophisticated shape models for asteroids , whose shape can be highly irregular . A notable example of this occurred in 2002 when the asteroid 345 Tercidina underwent a stellar occultation of a very bright star as seen from Europe . During this event a team of at least 105 observers recorded 75 chords across the asteroid 's surface allowing for a very accurate size and shape determination .

The Courrières mine disaster , Europe 's worst mining accident , involved the death of 1,099 miners in Northern France on March 10 , 1906 . This disaster was surpassed only by the Benxihu Colliery accident in China on April 26 , 1942 , which killed 1,549 miners . While mining today is substantially safer than it was in previous decades , mining accidents still occur . Government figures indicate that 5,000 Chinese miners die in accidents each year , while other reports have suggested a figure as high as 20,000 . Mining accidents continue worldwide , including accidents causing dozens of fatalities at a time such as the 2007 Ulyanovskaya Mine disaster in Russia , the 2009 Heilongjiang mine explosion in China , and the 2010 Upper Big Branch Mine disaster in the United States . Mining has been identified by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ( NIOSH ) as a priority industry sector in the National Occupational Research Agenda ( NORA ) to identify and provide intervention strategies regarding occupational health and safety issues . The Mining Safety and Health Administration ( MSHA ) was established in 1978 to " work to prevent death , illness , and injury from mining and promote safe and healthful workplaces for US miners .

		ANSWER=assassination in 1979
		GOLD_MENTION=assassination
		CONTEXT=In handling the Korean DMZ conflict of 1966 – 1969 , Park Chung-hee enabled industrial progress while suppressing the rights of the South Korean people . According to Major Daniel P. Bolger 's analysis , Park enjoyed the emergency powers at his disposal in the time of conflict , which he preserved until 1979 . The military , intelligence and police forces he consolidated in order to defeat the DPRK and flout the invasion of Ulchin-Samcheok were re-calibrated towards suppressing human rights , domestic opponents and restricting freedom of speech and press . The adoption of the Yusin Constitution on November 21 , 1972 , granted President Park full control over South Korea by co-opting the rule of law until his assassination in 1979 at the hands of secret service chief Kim Jae-kyu . Some historians argue that the consolidation of the military established under Park paved the way for continued authoritarianism even after Park 's demise , as evidenced by General Cheon Hu-hwan 's brief repetition of martial law in 1980 . As a consequence , the accumulation of emergency powers during the time of Ulchin-Samcheok delayed the democratization of South Korea in the long term

		ANSWER=2006 crash of S7 Airlines Flight 778
		GOLD_MENTION=S7 Airlines Flight 778
		CONTEXT=Rasputin 's daughter Maria died in the 2006 crash of S7 Airlines Flight 778 , and his wife died six years later . He died in Moscow on 14 March 2015 , a day short of his 78th birthday . Patriarch Kirill of the Russian Orthodox Church conducted his funeral service , and President Vladimir Putin paid his respects . ( In 2014 Rasputin had co-signed a letter by writers in support of Putin 's annexation of the Crimea . ) Rasputin is closely associated with a movement in post-war Soviet literature known as " village prose , " or sometimes " rural prose " ( деревенская проза ) . Beginning in the time of the Khrushchev Thaw ( оттепель ) , village prose was praised for its stylistic and thematic departures from socialist realism . Village prose works usually focused on the hardships of the Soviet peasantry , espoused an idealized picture of traditional village life , and implicitly or explicitly criticized official modernization projects . Rasputin 's 1979 novel '' Farewell to Matyora '' , which depicts a fictional Siberian village which is to be evacuated and cleared so that a hydroelectric dam can be constructed further down the Angara River , was considered the epitome of this genre . The opening paragraph below is a good example of Rasputin 's writing style ( exceptional even for the village prose writers ) , and the novel 's theme of natural cycles disrupted by modernization : '' Once more spring had come , one more in the never-ending cycle , but for Matyora this spring would be the last , the last for both the island and the village that bore the same name . Once more , rumbling passionately , the ice broke , piling up mounds on the banks , and the liberated Angara River opened up , stretching out into a mighty , sparkling flow . Once more the water gushed boisterously at the island ’s upper tip , before cascading down both channels of the riverbed ; once more greenery flared on the ground and in the greens , the first rains soaked the earth , the swifts and swallows flew back , and at dusk in the bogs the awakened frogs croaked their love of life . It had all happened many times before . '' ( From Rasputin 's novel '' Farewell to Matyora '' , translated by Antonina W. Bouis , 1979 ) Rasputin 's nonfiction works contain similar themes , often in support of relevant political causes . He directed particularly trenchant criticism at large-scale dam building , like the project that flooded his own hometown , and water management projects , like the diversion of the Siberian rivers to Central Asia . He argued that these projects were destructive not simply in an ecological sense , but in a moral sense as well

		ANSWER=murder
		GOLD_MENTION=
		CONTEXT=The dangers to journalists in Russia have been well known since the early 1990s but concern over the number of unsolved killings soared after Anna Politkovskaya 's murder in Moscow on 7 October 2006 . While international monitors mentioned a dozen deaths , some sources within Russia talked of over two hundred fatalities . The evidence has since been examined and documented in two reports , published in Russian and English , by international organizations . These revealed a basic confusion in terminology that explained the seemingly enormous numerical discrepancy : statistics of premature death among journalists ( from work accidents , crossfire incidents , and purely criminal or domestic cases of manslaughter ) were repeatedly equated with the much smaller number of targeted ( contract ) killings or work - related murders . The Remembrance Day of Journalists Killed in the Line of Duty in Russia is observed on 15 December every year .

However , a couple of days later , the AHL 's Bridgeport Sound Tigers , for whom Valiquette had played while in the Islanders ' system , put out a call for an emergency backup , as they were shorthanded due to injuries with their Islanders parent club . Ultimately , Valiquette wound up not having to play for the Sound Tigers , and moved on to play for HC Valpellice of the Italian Serie A league , which in 14 games , he led in save percentage and goals against average . After his season at HC Valpellice , Valiquette signed with Swedish club Djurgården of the HockeyAllsvenskan league , but instead retired due to injury

I noticed beside me a hole by which I left without knowing how , and I fell into a mud puddle . I then could contemplate the flames which consumed the plane . It was not about excess weight . It 's a simple mechanical failure . The crash was similar to the 1996 Air Africa crash , which also involved an Antonov An-32 overshooting the runway ( albeit at Kinshasa 's other airport N'Dolo ) with massive casualties on the ground . The DRC has an aviation safety track record that has been dubbed " an embarrassment " by the IATA , and the Transport Minister Rémy Henri Kuseyo Gatanga was fired by the President for culpable negligence in failing to enforce adequate standards and procedures for aviation safety management . One source indicates that the lifting of the Transport Minister 's ban on Antonov flights over DRC territory was not by his order but rather that of the Minister of State to the Head of State

		CONTEXT=On 18 April 1906 a major earthquake hit San Francisco , and the resulting fires destroyed over 80 % of the city , killed thousands of people , and left half of the population homeless . Misled by local propaganda as to earthquake likelihood , few residents of San Francisco had bought earthquake insurance , but they had bought fire insurance . In the wake of the devastating fires following the earthquake , many insurance companies fought paying their policyholders , often by quibbling over causality ( since the insurance was not for earthquakes ) , or paying only 75 % of the amounts due . This led to many lawsuits from policyholders . At least 14 insurers went bankrupt , and some insurers – mostly German and Austrian – simply disappeared and denied all coverage

" His ambition to filter the internet for ' negative ' content , shelved in early 2010 in the face of broad opposition , may be revived after a celebrity sex scandal centred on Ariel ( Nazril Irham ) , which Sembiring controversially linked to the crucifixion of Jesus Christ . The move apparently has the backing of then-president Dr Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and would involve a blacklist of offensive material monitored by a special task force , which gave birth to the controversial ' Internet Positif . ' He has also linked pornography to HIV/Aids and said that funding to fight the disease was a waste of money , also stating that the widespread availability of Indonesian pornography , mostly featuring students , caused natural disasters

		ANSWER=Sumatra earthquake
		GOLD_MENTION=Sumatra earthquake and other natural disasters
		CONTEXT=In 2009 , he blamed immorality for a Sumatra earthquake and other natural disasters . As he addressed a Friday prayer meeting in Padang , Sumatra , the minister said " there were many television programmes that destroyed morals . Therefore , natural disasters would continue to occur . " His ambition to filter the internet for ' negative ' content , shelved in early 2010 in the face of broad opposition , may be revived after a celebrity sex scandal centred on Ariel ( Nazril Irham ) , which Sembiring controversially linked to the crucifixion of Jesus Christ . The move apparently has the backing of then-president Dr Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and would involve a blacklist of offensive material monitored by a special task force , which gave birth to the controversial ' Internet Positif . ' He has also linked pornography to HIV/Aids and said that funding to fight the disease was a waste of money , also stating that the widespread availability of Indonesian pornography , mostly featuring students , caused natural disasters
