		CONTEXT=A 1950s proposal to construct a dam near Tocks Island across the Delaware River was met with considerable controversy and protest . Tocks Island is located in the Delaware River a short distance north from the Delaware Water Gap . In order to control damaging flooding and provide clean water to supply New York City and Philadelphia , the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers proposed building a dam . When completed , the Tocks Island Dam would have created a 37 - mile ( 60 - km ) long lake between Pennsylvania and New Jersey , with depths of up to 140 feet . This lake and the land surrounding were to be organized as the Tocks Island National Recreation Area . Although the dam was never built , 72,000 acres ( 291 km ² ) of land were acquired by condemnation and eminent domain . This incited environmental protesters and embittered local residents displaced by the project 's preparations when their property was condemned . After the Tocks Island Dam project was withdrawn , the lands acquired were transferred to the oversight of the National Park Service which reorganized them to establish the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area .

		GOLD_MENTION=Brighton hotel bomb attack
		CONTEXT=Throughout The Troubles , the Provisional IRA made extensive use of IEDs in their 1969 – 97 campaign . They used barrack buster mortars and remote controlled IEDs . Members of the IRA developed and counter-developed devices and tactics . IRA bombs became highly sophisticated , featuring anti-handling devices such as a mercury tilt switch or microswitches . These devices would detonate the bomb if it was moved in any way . Typically , the safety-arming device used was a clockwork Memopark timer , which armed the bomb up to 60 minutes after it was placed by completing an electrical circuit supplying power to the anti-handling device . Depending on the particular design ( e.g. , boobytrapped briefcase or car bomb ) an independent electrical circuit supplied power to a conventional timer set for the intended time delay , e.g. 40 minutes . However , some electronic delays developed by IRA technicians could be set to accurately detonate a bomb weeks after it was hidden , which is what happened in the Brighton hotel bomb attack of 1984 . Initially , bombs were detonated either by timer or by simple command wire . Later , bombs could be detonated by radio control . Initially , simple servos from radio-controlled aircraft were used to close the electrical circuit and supply power to the detonator . After the British developed jammers , IRA technicians introduced devices that required a sequence of pulsed radio codes to arm and detonate them . These were harder to jam

I received a phone call and said , ' Oh , wow , the United States has come under attack . ' It was exciting . " According to '' The Times '' , Bakri was left alone by British law prior to July 2005 despite actions such as an issuing a fatwa " containing a death threat against President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan " because : Bakri , who acts as al-Muhajiroun 's spiritual leader , insisted that his followers obey a " covenant of security " which , while encouraging terror abroad , forbade them from carrying out attacks in Britain . But " the authorities may have been lulled into a false sense of security " , because the covenant was not permanent .

" US President Barack Obama approved the targeted killing of al-Awlaki by April 2010 , making al-Awlaki the first US citizen ever placed on the CIA target list . That required the consent of the US National Security Council , and officials argued that the attack was appropriate because the individual posed an imminent danger to national security . In May 2010 , Faisal Shahzad , who pleaded guilty to the 2010 Times Square car bombing attempt , told interrogators he was " inspired by " al-Awlaki , and sources said Shahzad had made contact with al-Awlaki over the Internet . Representative Jane Harman called him " terrorist number one " , and '' Investor 's Business Daily '' called him " the world 's most dangerous man " . In July 2010 , the US Treasury Department added him to its list of Specially Designated Global Terrorists , and the UN added him to its list of individuals associated with al-Qaeda . In August 2010 , al-Awlaki 's father initiated a lawsuit against the US government with the American Civil Liberties Union , challenging its order to kill al-Awlaki . In October 2010 , US and UK officials linked al-Awlaki to the 2010 cargo plane bomb plot . In September 2011 , al-Awlaki was killed in a targeted killing drone attack in Yemen . On March 16 , 2012 , it was reported that Osama bin Laden plotted to kill US President Barack Obama

		CONTEXT=In April 2010 , six main characters were axed from '' EastEnders '' by executive producer Bryan Kirkwood . Fatboy was not one of them , but Stuart Heritage from '' The Guardian '' felt that he should have been , calling him " A wodge of irritating comic relief ... who is yet to serve a purpose other than making me genuinely dislike young people . ... He must go , preferably in a scene where he falls down the world 's largest flight of stairs . " Heritage later called Fatboy an " obnoxiously two-dimensional dubstep-fixated stock character transparently modelled on Jar Jar Binks . " A writer for the website Watch With Mothers called the character an asset to '' EastEnders '' , expressing pleasure that the show was trying to appeal to younger viewers , while another called him irritating and zany . A writer for '' The Northern Echo '' wondered if Fatboy , along with Leon and Zsa Zsa , brought a new injection of life into the soap or took away screen time from more established characters , and Caroline Fitton , writing for the '' Daily Mail '' , felt that Fatboy 's style of talking was a bit of a cliché . Grace Dent from '' The Guardian '' changed her opinion of Fatboy over time , saying : Julie Emery from '' Heat '' criticised Fatboy 's fashion sense , especially from the episode broadcast on 12 May 2011 , saying " We know clashing prints are soooooo this season , but really , Fatboy , they do nothing for you . And while we 're at it , stop wearing that tinny ' F ' round your neck , for flip 's sake . You 're not a gangster rapper , and anyway your real name 's Arthur . " Emery also said the storyline where Fatboy asks Mercy to marry him so she can stay in the country sounded " somewhat familiar " , as '' Coronation Street '' was featuring a similar storyline at the same time . Amy Duncan from the '' Metro '' said Fatboy was one of her favourite young characters in '' EastEnders '' and said that , with Poppy , he " bring s some much-needed light into the soap " . Vicky Prior from the '' Metro '' said that Fatboy " is easily one of the best characters in '' EastEnders '' , able to interact seamlessly with other characters , both young and old .

		CONTEXT=The show received a mixed reception from media publications . On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes , the show holds an approval rating of 43 % based on 30 critics , and summarized , " The 90th Academy Awards played it safe and hit no major snags -- but by clocking in at over four hours , returning host Jimmy Kimmel and company wore out their welcome long before the surprise ending . " Hank Stuever of '' The Washington Post '' marked , " In his second year , Kimmel has shown that the telecast need n't be anything but sharp and sure , with a funny host whose bits are manageable , shareable and – best of all – forgotten . We 're not making showbiz history here ; we 're just trying to get through another Oscar night . " Chief critic David Edelstein of '' Vulture '' wrote , " This was the best , most inspiring , and most sheerly likable Academy Awards telecast I 've ever seen . ... It was also – in terms of the actual awards – among the most disappointing . " '' Vanity Fair '' s , Richard Lawson wrote , " As a host , Kimmel struck a careful , appropriately measured tone ... All told , Sunday 's ceremony did an admirable job of recognizing all the turmoil surrounding it while maintaining the silly , chintzy trappings that so many of us tune into the Oscars for . " CNN 's Brian Lowry quipped , " The Oscars are a big , unwieldy beast , which invariably try to serve too many masters . Yet if the intent was ultimately to maintain a celebratory tone without ignoring either the outside world or the elephant in the room throughout this year 's awards , host Jimmy Kimmel and the show itself largely succeeded . " Others were more critical of the show . Television critic Maureen Ryan of '' Variety '' said , " All things considered , the show had a more or less low-key vibe . Normally it takes about two hours for the numbing effect to set in , but despite host Jimmy Kimmel 's best efforts , Sunday 's telecast started to feel a bit languid and low-energy far earlier . " Television critic James Poniewozik of '' The New York Times '' said , " despite the recent upheaval in Hollywood , the ceremony at large still focused mainly on celebration and glitter literally , in the case of the blinding set , which looked as if the ceremony were encased in an enormous geode . There 's also the perennial problem of bloat . The hitch , of course , is that every part of the show has its constituency . " Darren Franich of '' Entertainment Weekly '' wrote , " What fun we had at this year 's Oscars ! Long show , sure , but where to cut it ? " Writing for '' Deadline '' Greg Evans said , " Did the nearly four-hour running time contain any moments for the Oscar ages ? Probably not . " David Wiegand of the '' San Francisco Chronicle '' wrote , " Even the hope that the noise of clapping might keep the audience at home and in the theater awake , there was little of that for anything except the entrance of actors of advance age . " '' The Oregonian '' columnist Kristi Turnquist wrote , " Was it respectful ? Absolutely . Did it make for kind of a dull , earnest Oscars show ? Yeah , kind of . " Attaining 26.5 million U.S. viewers according to Nielsen ratings , the ceremony 's telecast had a 16-percent drop in viewership from last year 's ceremony and had the lowest U.S. viewership in Oscar history . On March 6 , after the final ratings were confirmed , President Donald Trump took to his Twitter account , saying , " Lowest rated Oscars in HISTORY . Problem is , we do n't have stars anymore – except your President ( just kidding , of course ) ! " . In response , Kimmel also tweeted , saying , " Thanks , lowest rated President in HISTORY .

" Dipanjan Sinha of '' Hindustan Times '' gave the film a rating of 3/5 stars , praising the film 's cinematography and special effects , but found faults with some of the female characters . Sinha stated , " Devasena ... starts off as an ace warrior only to be tamed into someone who has to be protected . " Shubhra Gupta of '' Indian Express '' rated the film 2/5 stars , noting problems with pacing and sound , writing , " The background music is relentless , and the pitch at which the declamatory dialogues are delivered is deafening : there were times I felt like closing my ears .

" Mike McCahill of The Guardian gave a 4/5 rating and called it " a jaw-dropping blockbuster that combines nimble action with genuine heart " . He also stated , " This production 's triumph is the room it 's granted Rajamouli to head into the fields and dream up endlessly expressive ways to frame bodies in motion . Of the many sequences here primed to cut through jadedness , perhaps the most wondrous is that which finds Baahu guiding Deva mid-battle to shoot three arrows simultaneously – a set piece that speaks both to a love of action , and love in action . The budget 's big , the muscle considerable , but they 're nothing compared with '' Baahubali '' s heart . " Manjusha Radhakrishnan of '' Gulf News '' rates the film 3.5 out of 5 and writes , " This is a sweeping visual spectacle filled with epic battle scenes , clashes between warring troops from Indian mythology and elephants on a rampage , " but further added , " There were times in the second half where you felt the computer-generated graphics took over the story . But all this is new and exotic for Indian cinema . " Shilpa Jamkhandikar of '' Reuters '' writes , " It may not up the ante from the last film , but it does n't let up on the pace either . For an Indian film , that is no mean feat .

" Kabita Maharana of '' International Business Times '' gave a rating of 4 out of 5 and writes , " From the very first scene , the film is a visual extravaganza . Every frame is meticulously captured by SS Rajamouli and his team . This is the first Indian film hailed for excelling in visual effects . " Simon Abrams of RogerEbert.com gave the film a 4/4 rating and writes the film " is everything I want but rarely get from superhero and big-budget fantasy movie " adding " the fight scenes ... are so creative that they make even the most frequently abused creative shortcuts seem novel , everything from computer-generated imagery ( CGI ) to speed-ramping ... You care what happens to the cast as they , aided by wires , hurl volleys of arrows at disposable minions and CGI animals . " Anita Iyer from '' Khaleej Times '' rates the film 3.5 out of 5 and writes , " What stands out in the film is the powerful star cast . Enough has been said already about the acting prowess of Prabhas but he has an equally supportive cast to hold the film . Ramya Krishna as Sivagami , is known for her impressive acting talent and proves her mettle here . Another veteran , Sathyaraj as Katappa excels and you develop a camaraderie with him .

		CONTEXT=In a positive review for '' Cuepoint '' , Robert Christgau argued that while Azalea may never demonstrate a powerful , soulful , or attractively melodic delivery , her " striving Australian-Atlantan cadence " is original and carries every song . He deemed ' ' The New Classic '' " plenty authentic -- and damn good to boot " while dismissing Azalea 's media naysayers : " predictably , the songs where she expresses wonderment that ' Impossible Is Nothing ' are more relatable than the ones where she flaunts her liquid assets . But the ones where she pledges to keep on striving are more relatable than that , because striving is built into her flow itself . That 's what her complexity is about . " Phil Johnson from '' The Independent '' called it " an instantly engaging showcase of the 23-year-old Aussie 's talents – poppy without diluting her fierce-flowing charisma . " Kellan Miller of '' XXL '' said despite some poor songs near the end of the record , it is " a persuasive indicator that Iggy Azalea will be around for the long haul . " '' The New Classic '' was named one of the best hip-hop albums of the year by '' XXL '' on a list published on 30 June 2014 , adding that " the album proved to a gang of skepts who doubted Iggy 's controversial style from the start that she was more than capable of making hip-hop tracks with a pop appeal . " It was placed at number twenty-five on Digital Spy 's top albums of 2014 and listed among Fuse 's 40 best albums of 2014 . The album won the Breakthrough Artist Release award at the 2014 ARIA Music Awards and Favorite Rap/Hip-Hop Album at the 2014 American Music Awards , beating out Drake 's '' Nothing Was the Same '' and Eminem 's '' The Marshall Mathers LP 2 '' .

On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes , the show holds an approval rating of 43 % based on 30 critics , and summarized , " The 90th Academy Awards played it safe and hit no major snags -- but by clocking in at over four hours , returning host Jimmy Kimmel and company wore out their welcome long before the surprise ending . " Hank Stuever of '' The Washington Post '' marked , " In his second year , Kimmel has shown that the telecast need n't be anything but sharp and sure , with a funny host whose bits are manageable , shareable and – best of all – forgotten . We 're not making showbiz history here ; we 're just trying to get through another Oscar night . " Chief critic David Edelstein of '' Vulture '' wrote , " This was the best , most inspiring , and most sheerly likable Academy Awards telecast I 've ever seen . ... It was also – in terms of the actual awards – among the most disappointing . " '' Vanity Fair '' s , Richard Lawson wrote , " As a host , Kimmel struck a careful , appropriately measured tone ... All told , Sunday 's ceremony did an admirable job of recognizing all the turmoil surrounding it while maintaining the silly , chintzy trappings that so many of us tune into the Oscars for . " CNN 's Brian Lowry quipped , " The Oscars are a big , unwieldy beast , which invariably try to serve too many masters . Yet if the intent was ultimately to maintain a celebratory tone without ignoring either the outside world or the elephant in the room throughout this year 's awards , host Jimmy Kimmel and the show itself largely succeeded . " Others were more critical of the show . Television critic Maureen Ryan of '' Variety '' said , " All things considered , the show had a more or less low-key vibe . Normally it takes about two hours for the numbing effect to set in , but despite host Jimmy Kimmel 's best efforts , Sunday 's telecast started to feel a bit languid and low-energy far earlier . " Television critic James Poniewozik of '' The New York Times '' said , " despite the recent upheaval in Hollywood , the ceremony at large still focused mainly on celebration and glitter literally , in the case of the blinding set , which looked as if the ceremony were encased in an enormous geode . There 's also the perennial problem of bloat . The hitch , of course , is that every part of the show has its constituency . " Darren Franich of '' Entertainment Weekly '' wrote , " What fun we had at this year 's Oscars ! Long show , sure , but where to cut it ? " Writing for '' Deadline '' Greg Evans said , " Did the nearly four-hour running time contain any moments for the Oscar ages ? Probably not . " David Wiegand of the '' San Francisco Chronicle '' wrote , " Even the hope that the noise of clapping might keep the audience at home and in the theater awake , there was little of that for anything except the entrance of actors of advance age . " '' The Oregonian '' columnist Kristi Turnquist wrote , " Was it respectful ? Absolutely . Did it make for kind of a dull , earnest Oscars show ? Yeah , kind of . " Attaining 26.5 million U.S. viewers according to Nielsen ratings , the ceremony 's telecast had a 16-percent drop in viewership from last year 's ceremony and had the lowest U.S. viewership in Oscar history . On March 6 , after the final ratings were confirmed , President Donald Trump took to his Twitter account , saying , " Lowest rated Oscars in HISTORY . Problem is , we do n't have stars anymore – except your President ( just kidding , of course ) ! " . In response , Kimmel also tweeted , saying , " Thanks , lowest rated President in HISTORY .

It 's designed to be a cinematic celebration , one that deserves to be watched on the largest screen possible " . Anupama Subramanian of the '' Deccan Chronicle '' gave the film a 3.5 / 5 , praising the acting of the stars while complaining about " the lack of a solid plot ' and called the ending " predictable . " Vishnuprasad Pillai of '' Asianet News '' gave a negative review , writing that the film " offers nothing new ... The writing from KV Vijayendra Prasad fails inspire or to do justice to an epic of such scale , " adding that " the dialogues at times are downright corny and plot developments cringe-worthy . " Dipanjan Sinha of '' Hindustan Times '' gave the film a rating of 3/5 stars , praising the film 's cinematography and special effects , but found faults with some of the female characters . Sinha stated , " Devasena ... starts off as an ace warrior only to be tamed into someone who has to be protected . " Shubhra Gupta of '' Indian Express '' rated the film 2/5 stars , noting problems with pacing and sound , writing , " The background music is relentless , and the pitch at which the declamatory dialogues are delivered is deafening : there were times I felt like closing my ears . " Taran Adarsh of '' Bollywood Hungama '' rates the film 4.5 out of 5 and praises the performance of the cast , writing , " It 's a feast for moviegoers and has the trappings to make all generations its fan . " Meena Iyer from '' The Times of India '' rated it 4/5 , writing : " Just savor it . It is a visual extravaganza that India must feast on ... Prabhas is terrific as father and son . Of course , it is CGI and VFX that grab you in your seat . " Hemanth Kumar from '' Firstpost '' called it " Rajamouli 's epic drama " and rated it 4/5 . Sukanya Verma from '' Rediff '' rated the film 3.5 / 5 , writing the film , " continues its tradition of grandiloquence and magnitude ... high drama , more than spectacle , is what lends its riveting tale of revenge and glory all its wallop and wizardry . " She also praised the film 's cast and director stating , " Equipped with a cast that 's not only in tune with Rajamouli 's vision but knows exactly where to hold back and when to give their all adds to Baahubali 's might . " It was further featured in Rotten Tomatoes ' list of Best Off the Radar Films of 2017 , in which Tim Ryan writes , " '' Baahubali 2 : The Conclusion '' plays like a shotgun wedding between '' Ben Hur '' and '' Kung Fu Hustle '' , seasoned with bits of Shakespeare , Kurosawa , and Buster Keaton , " opining , " it 's a blockbuster that 's both gigantic and lighter than air . " Mike McCahill of The Guardian gave a 4/5 rating and called it " a jaw-dropping blockbuster that combines nimble action with genuine heart " . He also stated , " This production 's triumph is the room it 's granted Rajamouli to head into the fields and dream up endlessly expressive ways to frame bodies in motion . Of the many sequences here primed to cut through jadedness , perhaps the most wondrous is that which finds Baahu guiding Deva mid-battle to shoot three arrows simultaneously – a set piece that speaks both to a love of action , and love in action . The budget 's big , the muscle considerable , but they 're nothing compared with '' Baahubali '' s heart . " Manjusha Radhakrishnan of '' Gulf News '' rates the film 3.5 out of 5 and writes , " This is a sweeping visual spectacle filled with epic battle scenes , clashes between warring troops from Indian mythology and elephants on a rampage , " but further added , " There were times in the second half where you felt the computer-generated graphics took over the story . But all this is new and exotic for Indian cinema . " Shilpa Jamkhandikar of '' Reuters '' writes , " It may not up the ante from the last film , but it does n't let up on the pace either . For an Indian film , that is no mean feat . " J Hurtado of '' ScreenAnarchy '' writes , " It 's a bit daunting because it does begin in media res immediately following the complex actions of the first film , but astute viewers will put together the pieces soon enough . " Kabita Maharana of '' International Business Times '' gave a rating of 4 out of 5 and writes , " From the very first scene , the film is a visual extravaganza . Every frame is meticulously captured by SS Rajamouli and his team . This is the first Indian film hailed for excelling in visual effects . " Simon Abrams of RogerEbert.com gave the film a 4/4 rating and writes the film " is everything I want but rarely get from superhero and big-budget fantasy movie " adding " the fight scenes ... are so creative that they make even the most frequently abused creative shortcuts seem novel , everything from computer-generated imagery ( CGI ) to speed-ramping ... You care what happens to the cast as they , aided by wires , hurl volleys of arrows at disposable minions and CGI animals . " Anita Iyer from '' Khaleej Times '' rates the film 3.5 out of 5 and writes , " What stands out in the film is the powerful star cast . Enough has been said already about the acting prowess of Prabhas but he has an equally supportive cast to hold the film . Ramya Krishna as Sivagami , is known for her impressive acting talent and proves her mettle here . Another veteran , Sathyaraj as Katappa excels and you develop a camaraderie with him . Rana Daggubati is aptly spiteful in his portrayal of the villain ... Nassar , as his father , is busy spewing venom but his role could have been meatier . " '' The Conclusion '' won the Telstra People 's Choice Award at the Indian Film Festival of Melbourne , sharing the prize with '' Dangal '' . Tamannaah Bhatia and K.V. Vijayendra Prasad won the Global Indian Impact Icon Award for '' The Conclusion '' at NRI of the Year Awards .

However , when its defense proved untenable , the Romanian 2nd Army withdrew from the city , leaving behind only 1,175 prisoners .

		GOLD_MENTION=events in Moscow
		CONTEXT=By 1948 it was becoming apparent that the government control structure being unrolled in the Soviet occupation zone was based on careful planning . The key planners were a group of German Communist party members who had spent the Nazi period , including the war years , exiled in Moscow , and survived . On 30 April 1945 the 30 man Ulbricht Group had been flown in from Moscow to " prepare the ground " for the period of Soviet occupation . From the outset there was a certain mutual mistrust between the senior party comrades returning from Moscow , led by Walter Ulbricht and also including Wilhelm Pieck , and others who had survived the war years exiled in western Europe . Suspicion of the western survivors was especially intense where their wartime experiences had involved contact with Americans . Government nervousness increased during the later 1948s in the wider context of growing cold war tensions . In September 1948 the East German leader Walter Ulbricht announced the creation of an SED Party Control Commission , mandated to " lead the fight against hostile agents in the service of foreign powers " . This turned out to be the prelude to a period of purges in East Germany that recalled events in Moscow during the later 1930s . The targets in East Germany were ( again ) identified as " Trotskyists " and " anglo-american agents " . Marie Weiterer 's work for the Unitarian Universalist Service Committee in the south of France and later in Paris had always been undertaken with the full agreement of the leadership of the exiled German Communist party , but in the new spirit of the age it was nevertheless now characterised by the East German authorities as amounting to espionage activity undertaken in the service of Noel Field . On 1 September 1950 the party Central Committee published the text of a resolution dated 24 August 1950 ( identified as the " Field resolution " ) which excluded various senior party officers from party membership . Those accused were then sent into what amounted to " internal exile " . The most senior of these was Paul Merker . Maria Weiterer was another of those excluded from the party and stripped of all party related functions

The division had already distinguished itself during the Winter War with Finland in 1940 and had been decorated with the Order of Lenin ; soon after its redesignation it also received its first Order of the Red Banner . It was in Southern Front as this time but was soon moved to the Reserve of the Supreme High Command where it was assigned to 7th Reserve Army in May , then to 28th Army in Southwestern Front in June , then to 57th Army in Stalingrad Front in July . It remained in that Army for the rest of the year , with one brief exception , until it was transferred to Don Front 's 64th Army in January , 1943 during the closing stages of the battle of Stalingrad . In March this Army became 7th Guards Army and was railed to the northwest , joining Voronezh Front south of the Kursk salient . In the battle that followed the 15th Guards assisted in the defeat of Army Detachment Kempf , then took part in the summer offensive into Ukraine , winning one of the first battle honors at Kharkov . It remained in either 7th Guards or 37th Army into the spring of 1944 . It saw action in the Nikopol - Krivoi Rog Offensive and was awarded the Order of Suvorov before being involved in the frustrating battles along the Dniestr River on the Romanian border . In June the division became part of 34th Guards Rifle Corps in 5th Guards Army and was redeployed north becoming part of 1st Ukrainian Front and taking part in the Lvov – Sandomierz Offensive into Poland . The 15th Guards made a spectacular advance across Poland during the Vistula - Oder Offensive and was further decorated with the Order of Kutuzov for forcing a crossing of the Oder River . It then saw action in the drive on Berlin in April and the Prague Offensive in May , winning a further battle honor and an unusual second Order of the Red Banner in the process .

		CONTEXT=The Germans now took over the Italian zone , and soon proved to be a totally different opponent from the demoralized , war-weary and far less brutal Italians . Already since the early summer of 1943 , German troops had been pouring into Greece , fearing an Allied landing there ( in fact falling victims to a grand-scale Allied strategic deception operation , " Operation Barclay " ) . Soon they became involved in wide-ranging counterguerrilla operations , which they carried out with great ruthlessness , based on their experiences in Yugoslavia . In the course of these operations , mass reprisals were carried out , resulting in war crimes such as at Kommeno on August 16 , the Massacre of Kalavryta in December and the Massacre of Distomo in June 1944 . At the same time , hundreds of villages were systematically torched and almost one million people left homeless

The Armenian wartime losses of a million , the Adana massacres , and Hamidian massacres had been combined for the sake of what the commission at one point called " justice , " in what appears to have been an attempt to maximize the population count . The Armenian estimates showed the same tendency . At times , they were even reduced to 500,000 when the high Armenian death count endangered the possibility of an Armenian state including Ottoman territory , and in other instances raised to over a million .

		CONTEXT=African military systems before 1800 refers to the evolution of military systems on the African continent prior to 1800 , with emphasis on the role of indigenous states and peoples , whose leaders and fighting forces were born on the continent , with their main military bases , fortifications , and supply sources based on or deriving from the continent , and whose operations were conducted within the continental mass or close to its borders or coasts . Development of the military arts in this framework generally moved from the simple to the more sophisticated as economies and cultures became more elaborate . Areas such as Carthage , Egypt and Nubia are reflected in the antiquarian period . The pre-colonial period also saw a number of military systems - from cavalry empires on the grasslands , to kingdoms in more tropical and forested areas . The emergence of the gunpowder era , alongside developments in indigenous organization and culture , was to spark far - reaching consequences cutting across all regions , with ripple effects in culture , politics and economies .

		CONTEXT=Cassandreia or Kassandreia ( , Kassándreia ) was once one of the most important cities in Ancient Macedonia , founded by and named after Cassander in 316 BC . It was located on the site of the earlier Ancient Greek city of Potidaea , at the isthmus of the Pallene peninsula . The fact that Cassander named it after himself suggests that he may have intended it to be his capital , and if the canal which cuts the peninsula at this point was dug or at least planned in his time , he may have intended to develop his naval forces using it as a base with two harbours on the east and west sides . Cassandreia soon became a great and powerful city , surpassing the other Macedonian towns in wealth . Philip V of Macedon made Cassandreia his main naval base . At the end of the Roman Republic , around 43 BC by order of Brutus a Roman colony was settled by the proconsul Q. Hortensius Hortalus , which 30 BC was resettled by August with the installation of new settlers and took the official name Colonia Iulia Augusta Cassandrensis . The territory of the colony had included within its boundaries the peninsula of Pallini and the district stretched north of the canal to the foot of the mountain Cholomontas . The colony enjoyed ius Italicum , and is mentioned in Pliny the Elder 's encyclopaedia and in inscriptions . It was destroyed by the Huns and Slavs around 540 AD .

		CONTEXT=Avicennism is a school of Islamic philosophy which was established by Avicenna . He developed his philosophy throughout the course of his life after being deeply moved and concerned by the Metaphysics of Aristotle and studying it for over a year . According to Henry Corbin and Seyyed Hossein Nasr , there are two kind of Avicennism : Islamic or Iranian Avicennism , and Latin Avicennism . According to Nasr , the Latin Avicennism was based on the former philosophical works of Avicenna . This school followed the Peripatetic school of philosophy and tried to describe the structure of reality with a rational system of thinking . In the twelfth century AD , It became influential in Europe , particularly in Oxford and Paris , and affected some notable philosophers such as Thomas Aquinas , Roger Bacon and Duns Scotus . While the Latin Avicennism was weak in comparison with Latin Averroism , according to Étienne Gilson there was an " Avicennising Augustinism " . On the other hand , Islamic Avicennism is based on his later works which is known as " The oriental philosophy " ( حکمت المشرقیین ) . Therefore , philosophy in the eastern Islamic civilization providing became close to gnosis and tried to provide a vision of a spiritual universe . This approach paved the road for the Iranian school of Illuminationism ( حکمت الاشراق ) by Suhrawardi .

		CONTEXT=Renaissance humanism came much later to Germany and Northern Europe in general than to Italy , and when it did , it encountered some resistance from the scholastic theology which reigned at the universities . Humanism may be dated from the invention of the printing press about 1450 . Its flourishing period began at the close of the 15th century and lasted only until about 1520 , when it was absorbed by the more popular and powerful religious movement , the Reformation , as Italian humanism was superseded by the papal counter-Reformation . Marked features distinguished the new culture north of the Alps from the culture of the Italians . The university and school played a much more important part than in the South according to Catholic historians . The representatives of the new scholarship were teachers ; even Erasmus taught in Cambridge and was on intimate terms with the professors at Basel . During the progress of the movement new universities sprang up , from Basel to Rostock . Again , in Germany , there were no princely patrons of arts and learning to be compared in intelligence and munificence to the Renaissance popes and the Medici . Nor was the new culture here exclusive and aristocratic . It sought the general spread of intelligence , and was active in the development of primary and grammar schools . In fact , when the currents of the Italian Renaissance began to set toward the North , a strong , independent , intellectual current was pushing down from the flourishing schools conducted by the Brethren of the Common Life . In the humanistic movement , the German people was far from being a slavish imitator . It received an impulse from the South , but made its own path .

The troops voted overwhelmingly to fight their former allies the Germans , thus the '' Acqui '' became one of the very few Italian units to actively resist the Germans . The Germans therefore summarily executed over half of the divisions soldiers and all of its officers in revenge during the Massacre of the Acqui Division

		GOLD_MENTION=1938 Yellow River flood
		CONTEXT=The name Zhengzhou came from the Sui dynasty ( AD 581 ) , even though it was located in Chenggao , another town . The government moved to the contemporary city during the Tang dynasty . It achieved its greatest importance under the Sui ( AD 581 – 618 ) , Tang ( 618 – 907 ) , and early Song ( 960 – 1127 ) dynasties , when it was the terminus of the New Bian Canal , which joined the Yellow River to the northwest . There , at a place called Heyin , a vast granary complex was established to supply the capitals at Luoyang and Chang ' an to the west and the frontier armies to the north . In the Song period , however , the transfer of the capital eastward to Kaifeng robbed Zhengzhou of much of its importance . It was a capital during the five dynasties of Xia , Shang , Guan , Zheng , and Han , and a prefecture during the eight dynasties of Sui , Tang , Five Dynasties , Song , Jin , Yuan , Ming , and Qing . In 1903 the Beijing – Hankou Railway arrived at Zhengzhou , and in 1909 the first stage of the Longhai Railway gave it an east – west link to Kaifeng and Luoyang ; it later was extended eastward to the coast at Lianyungang , Jiangsu , and westward to Xi'an ( Chang ' an ) , Shaanxi , as well as to western Shaanxi . Zhengzhou thus became a major rail junction and a regional center for cotton , grain , peanuts , and other agricultural produce . Early in 1923 a workers ' strike began in Zhengzhou and spread along the rail line before it was suppressed ; a 14-story double tower in the center of the city commemorates the strike . On June 10 , 1938 , Chiang Kai-shek 's National Revolutionary Army opened up the dikes retaining the Yellow River at Huayuankou between Zhengzhou and Kaifeng , in an effort to stem the tide of invading Japanese ; however , the ensuing 1938 Yellow River flood also killed hundreds of thousands of Chinese

Complete versions of the Huanglan existed until the Song dynasty ( 960-1279 ) , when it became a lost work , although some quotations did survive in other encyclopedias and anthologies . The Huanglan was the prototype of the classified encyclopedia and served as a model for later ones such as the ( 624 ) Tang Yiwen Leiju and the ( 1408 ) Ming Yongle dadian .

In the mid and late third century BC , the Qin state carried out a series of swift conquests , first ending the powerless Zhou dynasty and eventually conquering the other six of the Seven Warring States . Its 15 years was the shortest major dynasty in Chinese history , consisting of only two emperors , but inaugurated an imperial system that lasted from 221 BC , with interruption and adaptation , until 1912 AD .

		CONTEXT=The Huanglan or Imperial Mirror was the oldest Chinese encyclopedia or leishu " classified dictionary " . Cao Pi , the first emperor of the Wei , ordered its compilation upon his accession to the throne in 220 and it was completed in 222 . The purpose of the Huanglan was to provide the emperor and ministers of state with conveniently arranged summaries of all that was known at the time . Complete versions of the Huanglan existed until the Song dynasty ( 960-1279 ) , when it became a lost work , although some quotations did survive in other encyclopedias and anthologies . The Huanglan was the prototype of the classified encyclopedia and served as a model for later ones such as the ( 624 ) Tang Yiwen Leiju and the ( 1408 ) Ming Yongle dadian .

		CONTEXT=The name Zhengzhou came from the Sui dynasty ( AD 581 ) , even though it was located in Chenggao , another town . The government moved to the contemporary city during the Tang dynasty . It achieved its greatest importance under the Sui ( AD 581 – 618 ) , Tang ( 618 – 907 ) , and early Song ( 960 – 1127 ) dynasties , when it was the terminus of the New Bian Canal , which joined the Yellow River to the northwest . There , at a place called Heyin , a vast granary complex was established to supply the capitals at Luoyang and Chang ' an to the west and the frontier armies to the north . In the Song period , however , the transfer of the capital eastward to Kaifeng robbed Zhengzhou of much of its importance . It was a capital during the five dynasties of Xia , Shang , Guan , Zheng , and Han , and a prefecture during the eight dynasties of Sui , Tang , Five Dynasties , Song , Jin , Yuan , Ming , and Qing . In 1903 the Beijing – Hankou Railway arrived at Zhengzhou , and in 1909 the first stage of the Longhai Railway gave it an east – west link to Kaifeng and Luoyang ; it later was extended eastward to the coast at Lianyungang , Jiangsu , and westward to Xi'an ( Chang ' an ) , Shaanxi , as well as to western Shaanxi . Zhengzhou thus became a major rail junction and a regional center for cotton , grain , peanuts , and other agricultural produce . Early in 1923 a workers ' strike began in Zhengzhou and spread along the rail line before it was suppressed ; a 14-story double tower in the center of the city commemorates the strike . On June 10 , 1938 , Chiang Kai-shek 's National Revolutionary Army opened up the dikes retaining the Yellow River at Huayuankou between Zhengzhou and Kaifeng , in an effort to stem the tide of invading Japanese ; however , the ensuing 1938 Yellow River flood also killed hundreds of thousands of Chinese

		CONTEXT=Philip Nichols ( or Philip Nicolles , Philip Nicolls ) was an evangelical writer from the West Country active in the reign of King Edward VI . He was born in Ilfracombe , north Devon and he held property in south Devon . He was a client of the Protestant gentleman Sir Peter Carew and shared his patron 's enthusiasm for reformed religion . In 1548 , he made his modest reputation by publishing an open letter to Richard Crispin , a canon of Exeter Cathedral who had denounced Martin Luther in a sermon at Marldon on 24 March 1547 . This letter , very polite by the standards of early modern religious controversy , aimed to prove that the Bible is the principal " touch stone , or triall " of whether religious teachings are true or false . On the accession of Queen Mary I , Nichols fled into exile , joining a Protestant colony at Aarau . He returned to England in the reign of Queen Elizabeth I , and unsuccessfully attempted to lobby Sir William Cecil to step up the pace of religious reform . Between 23 November 1562 and 22 June 1564 , he held the living of Rimpton in the Diocese of Wells . The date of his death , like the date of his birth , is unknown .

" It was further featured in Rotten Tomatoes ' list of Best Off the Radar Films of 2017 , in which Tim Ryan writes , " '' Baahubali 2 : The Conclusion '' plays like a shotgun wedding between '' Ben Hur '' and '' Kung Fu Hustle '' , seasoned with bits of Shakespeare , Kurosawa , and Buster Keaton , " opining , " it 's a blockbuster that 's both gigantic and lighter than air . " Mike McCahill of The Guardian gave a 4/5 rating and called it " a jaw-dropping blockbuster that combines nimble action with genuine heart " . He also stated , " This production 's triumph is the room it 's granted Rajamouli to head into the fields and dream up endlessly expressive ways to frame bodies in motion . Of the many sequences here primed to cut through jadedness , perhaps the most wondrous is that which finds Baahu guiding Deva mid-battle to shoot three arrows simultaneously – a set piece that speaks both to a love of action , and love in action . The budget 's big , the muscle considerable , but they 're nothing compared with '' Baahubali '' s heart . " Manjusha Radhakrishnan of '' Gulf News '' rates the film 3.5 out of 5 and writes , " This is a sweeping visual spectacle filled with epic battle scenes , clashes between warring troops from Indian mythology and elephants on a rampage , " but further added , " There were times in the second half where you felt the computer-generated graphics took over the story . But all this is new and exotic for Indian cinema . " Shilpa Jamkhandikar of '' Reuters '' writes , " It may not up the ante from the last film , but it does n't let up on the pace either . For an Indian film , that is no mean feat . " J Hurtado of '' ScreenAnarchy '' writes , " It 's a bit daunting because it does begin in media res immediately following the complex actions of the first film , but astute viewers will put together the pieces soon enough . " Kabita Maharana of '' International Business Times '' gave a rating of 4 out of 5 and writes , " From the very first scene , the film is a visual extravaganza . Every frame is meticulously captured by SS Rajamouli and his team . This is the first Indian film hailed for excelling in visual effects . " Simon Abrams of RogerEbert.com gave the film a 4/4 rating and writes the film " is everything I want but rarely get from superhero and big-budget fantasy movie " adding " the fight scenes ... are so creative that they make even the most frequently abused creative shortcuts seem novel , everything from computer-generated imagery ( CGI ) to speed-ramping ... You care what happens to the cast as they , aided by wires , hurl volleys of arrows at disposable minions and CGI animals . " Anita Iyer from '' Khaleej Times '' rates the film 3.5 out of 5 and writes , " What stands out in the film is the powerful star cast . Enough has been said already about the acting prowess of Prabhas but he has an equally supportive cast to hold the film . Ramya Krishna as Sivagami , is known for her impressive acting talent and proves her mettle here . Another veteran , Sathyaraj as Katappa excels and you develop a camaraderie with him . Rana Daggubati is aptly spiteful in his portrayal of the villain ... Nassar , as his father , is busy spewing venom but his role could have been meatier .

		CONTEXT=Critical opinion regarding the film has been overwhelmingly positive . '' The Village Voice '' critic J. Hoberman , who in 1981 included the film in his list of the ten best films commercially released in the United States during that year , more recently wrote that the film is one " of the richest avant-garde features of the 1970s " and praised its " winning combination of sexual frankness and visual wit , " while another critic , Dennis Schwartz , wrote that the " film 's beauty is derived from its sexual frankness and playfully drawn out intimate relationship scenes , witty use of photography , and its originality as it breaks free of conventional unities of body , space and time . Export skillfully edits montage and integrates video , still photography , and performance art with elements from Cubism , Surrealism , Dada and avant-garde cinema . " '' Artforum '' noted in November 1980 that " w atching their scenes together , we realize how seldom , if ever before , the details of sexual intimacy have been shown in film from the point of view from a woman . Export privileges rupture over unity and never settles for one-dimensional solutions " and it was called one " of the most original films in this year 's exposition " and a " tour de force of cinematic invention " grounded in the director 's " fresh and intelligent sensibility , characteristically self-referential . Her visual resources include mirrors , still photography , video , dance , and films within the film , all employed with a bold and surprising inventiveness " by the catalogue notes of the 1978 Los Angeles International Film Exposition . Similarly , critic Alison Butler wrote that the " film is a witty and visually brilliant essay on gender and experience , culture and environment " and program notes used by the San Francisco Cinematheque during a screening quote critic Amy Taubin as opining that the film " makes you reconsider what you and everyone else is doing — in life and in art " and critic Steve Anker underscoring that it is an important " crossover film " combining " avant-garde and theatrical sensibilities , made during the mid-1970s . It chronicles the nightmarish breakdown of a fashion photographer as she confronts her waning identity and security as a career woman ; blending narrative experimentation , fantasy , fact and theoretical critique , it has enormous impact on independent features which followed it . " PopMatters noted that the film has " enough originality to nag at patient viewers and get at least partially under our skin " and critic Michael Atkinson wrote that it is a " weird , restless , beguilingly offbeat bit of dreamwork . " The film was presented for the first time at the Berlin International Film Festival in 1977 , it has won a Special Jury Prize at the Venice Film Festival and was recently called " seminal " during a screening at a repertory cinema , " a strong and humoristic showdown " at another and " a sonically-complex , montage-rich , darkly funny and uriniferous cornerstone of avant-garde cinema " during a screening at a New York University class . Critic Peter Hajek wrote in the Austrian newspaper '' Kurier '' that " Valie Export presents this psychopanoptic view of the present in solid , striking images and often in unexpected humorous passages . " Critic Chris Holmlund , author of the scholarly article " Feminist Makeovers : The Celluloid Surgery of Valie Export and Su Friedrich , " referred to '' Invisible Adversaries '' as a feminist version of '' Invasion of the Body Snatchers '' , noted that the film includes references to famous paintings and to '' Un Chien Andalou '' , and wrote that therefore it " is visually rick , entertaining , striking , but also demanding . " A few reviews , however , were negative . For example , London 's '' Time Out '' wrote about the film that it is " n ot unlike '' W.R. : Mysteries of the Organism '' " and that it will " probably age as badly " and a reviewer for '' The Heights '' wrote that " I was expecting a great feminist work here , but got mediocrity . I can not recommend that you see this film , " though he nevertheless praised the film as a " cornucopia of video spectacle in which Export delights , confounds and amuses the audience with her antics .

		CONTEXT=jurors of the Eurovision Song Contest 2009 play a large role in the voting process of the Contest . For the final round , each country 's votes will be decided by a combination of 50 % televoting by the public and 50 % by national jury . The method of selecting the semi-final qualifiers will remain the same as in past years , however , with nine countries in each semi-final which qualified based on the televoting results , and a tenth coming from the juries . In response to some broadcasters ' continued complaints about politically charged , neighbourly and diaspora voting , the European Broadcasting Union ( EBU ) evaluated the voting procedure used in the contest , and contemplated a change for 2009 . Contest organisers sent a questionnaire regarding the voting system to participating broadcasters , and a reference group incorporated the responses into their suggestions for next year 's format . Telewizja Polska ( TVP ) , the Polish broadcaster , suggested that an international jury similar to the one used in the 2008 Eurovision Dance Contest be introduced in the Eurovision Song Contest to lessen the impact of neighbourly voting and place more emphasis on the artistic value of the song . A jury would lead to less political and diaspora voting as the jury members , mandated to be music industry experts , would also have a say in addition to " random members of the public " . National juries were originally phased out of the contest beginning in 1997 , with televoting becoming mandatory for nearly all participants since 2003

A Poslouchej ) '' entitled " Samba " . Although the Eurosong 2007 final was not broadcast by ČT until 10 March 2007 the competing songs were made available for listening from the time of their announcement with voting - done by SMS - open from 23 February 2007 : around the last-named date ČT announced the disqualification of " Samba " citing the track had been recorded too far in advance to be considered as a possible entrant for Eurovision 2007 . Vondráčková , given the prerogative of competing in Eurosong 2007 with a more recent song , did submit the track " Ha ha ha " but soon withdrew from Eurosong 2007 citing her disenchantment with the winner being chosen by SMS voting

		CONTEXT=Cultural leveling is the process by which different cultures approach each other as a result of travel and communication . It can also refer to " the process by which Western culture is being exported and diffused into other nations . ” Cultural leveling within the United States has been driven by mass market media such as radio and television broadcasting and nationwide distribution of magazines and catalogs . Some of these means and effects are considered artifacts of the Machine Age of the 1920s and 1930s . Today the interactions between countries worldwide have allowed the opportunity for intercultural dialogue . Countries world wide have undergone a form of cultural leveling . Some countries being more open to it than others . Japan , for example , has assimilated Western styles of dress and music into a blend or Western and Eastern Cultures . Today , due to the crossing or travel and communication with time and space there is just about no “ other side of the world ” anymore , giving us the inevitable result of what is known as cultural leveling . Eclecticism and cultural leveling both share a similar ideology in the separation of culture from human nature creating the potential risk or enslavement and manipulation . Cultural leveling is notably present in minorities instead of large cultures driven to aspire wealth and there is more commonality present in minorities . At times countercultures and subcultures may pose as a resistance to cultural change within society . Local cultures did diffuse across each other in earlier times as material items hence influencing a change in the cultural atmosphere . These diffusions have been part of most significant cultural changes in recorded history . To convey how fundamental the loss of diversity and the subsequent leveling have been , many sociologists such as Daniel Lerner amplified the opinion through the phrase “ the passing of traditional society . ”

In releasing the first Kids of 88 album , Sugarpills , McCarthy said that the duo tried to produce a variety of material rather than just the familiarly slutty " My House " and " Just A Little Bit " ( released earlier as singles ) . Their style is broadly a fusion of electropop and 1980 's style dance music . They describe it as " a cross between a late 80 's police drama intro theme and a sophisticated super hussy " . A reviewer has said " while reminiscent of early 80s synthpop , they are n't a direct copy of their antecedents . There 's also a touch of 2010 punk swagger and adrenaline , where dance ca n't ignore what 's been achieved in R&B and hip-hop " . McCarthy and Arts produced the album themselves and worked with a simple technical set-up out of a bedroom . At the 2010 New Zealand Music Awards , Kids of 88 won " Single of the Year " and ( with Tim Van Dammen ) " Music Video of the Year " for their single Just a Little Bit

" Calling the album a marked improvement over " the diffuse , rambling songwriting of No Doubt 's two previous CDs " , Mike Boehm of the '' Los Angeles Times '' felt that on the album , " The band is bright , hard-hitting and kinetic , as sharp production captures the core , four-man instrumental team and adjunct horn section at their best " .

Yahoo! Music reviewer Bill Holdship called the album a " phenomenon " containing " hit after hit " , and describing " Spiderwebs " as " a terrific opener " .

		CONTEXT=" Wah - Wah " is a song by English rock musician George Harrison from his 1970 triple album All Things Must Pass . Harrison wrote the song following his temporary departure from the Beatles in January 1969 , during the troubled Get Back sessions that resulted in their Let It Be album and film . The lyrics reflect his frustration with the atmosphere in the group at that time – namely , Paul McCartney 's over-assertiveness and criticism of his guitar playing , John Lennon 's lack of engagement with the project and dismissal of Harrison as a songwriter , and Yoko Ono 's constant involvement in the band 's activities . Music critics and biographers recognise the song as Harrison 's statement of personal and artistic freedom from the Beatles . Its creation contrasted sharply with his rewarding collaborations outside the group in the months before the Get Back project , particularly with Bob Dylan and the Band in upstate New York .

		CONTEXT=In his analysis of the group 's influence on 21st century popular culture two decades after their debut , John Mckie of the BBC noted that while other stars had used brand endorsements in the past , " the Spice brand was the first to propel the success of the band " . '' The Guardian '' 's Sylvia Patterson also wrote of what she called the Spice Girls ' true legacy : " T hey were the original pioneers of the band as brand , of pop as a ruthless marketing ruse , of the merchandising and sponsorship deals that have dominated commercial pop ever since . " The mainstream media embraced the Spice Girls at the peak of their success . The group received regular international press coverage and were constantly followed by paparazzi . Paul Gorman of '' Music Week '' said of the media interest in the Spice Girls in the late 1990s : " They inaugurated the era of cheesy celebrity obsession which pertains today . There is lineage from them to the Kardashianisation not only of the music industry , but the wider culture . " The '' Irish Independent 's '' Tanya Sweeney agreed that " t he vapidity of paparazzi culture could probably be traced back to the Spice Girls ' naked ambitions " , while Mckie predicted that , " f or all that modern stars from Katy Perry to Lionel Messi exploit brand endorsements and attract tabloid coverage , the scale of the Spice Girls ' breakthrough in 1996 is unlikely to be repeated — at least not by a music act . " The Spice Girls have been revered as the biggest pop phenomenon of the 1990s due to their international record sales , iconic symbolism and " omnipresence " in the late 1990s . At the 2000 Brit Awards , the group received the Outstanding Contribution to Music award to mark their dominance of the global music scene in the 1990s . The iconic symbolism of the Spice Girls in the 1990s is partly attributed to their era-defining outfits , the most notable being the Union Jack dress that Geri Halliwell wore at the 1997 Brit Awards . The dress has achieved iconic status , becoming one of the most prominent symbols of 1990s pop culture . The status of the Spice Girls as 1990s pop icons is also attributed to their vast merchandising and willingness to be a part of a media-driven world . Their unprecedented appearances in adverts and the media solidified the group as a phenomenon — an icon of the decade and for British music

Hamilton was a steady performer for UCLA as they began the season ranked No. 2 after a 13 – 0 start , the first time they were undefeated in non-conference play since they won a national championship in 1994 – 95 . He was the team 's leading scorer through 11 games , and averaged 16.8 points and reached double-figures in all non-conference games . However , Hamilton 's average fell to 11.4 points in Pac-12 games , when he shot just 31.2 % on three-pointers . He scored in single figures eight times , including the first three games to start conference play . He scored just two points on 1-for-6 shooting in the conference opener against No. 21 Oregon , when the Bruins suffered their first defeat in an 89 – 87 loss . In the following game , he was held scoreless on 0-for-10 shooting in a 76 – 63 win over Oregon State . After a month-long shooting slump , during which he never divulged a pulled back muscle that required a doctor 's visit , Hamilton made a UCLA record nine three-pointers against Arizona State to tie the mark held by Alford and Jason Kapono . The Bruins won 102 – 80 , and Hamilton finished with a season-high 33 points on 10-for-17 shooting . He cooled off the following game , scoring 14 points on five-of-15 shooting in a 96 – 85 defeat to No. 14 Arizona for the Bruins first home loss of the season . In the Pac-12 Tournament , Hamilton averaged a team-high 21.0 points , but the Bruins were eliminated in the semifinals

Blickensderfer was the nephew of the inventor of the stenotype John Celivergos Zachos . Two models were initially unveiled to the public at the 1893 World 's Columbian Exposition in Chicago , the Model 1 and the Model 5 . His machines were originally intended to compete with larger Remington , Hammond and Yost typewriters , and were the first truly portable , full - keyboard typewriters . The design also enabled the typist to see the typed work at a time when most typewriters were understrike machines that concealed the writing . When Blickensderfer unveiled his small Model 5 at the 1893 World 's Fair , a stripped - down version of his larger more complex Model 1 machine , these revolutionary features attracted huge crowds and a full order book – many of them from Britain , Germany and France , whose business machine markets were more highly developed than the United States .

In the centuries following the battle , Qādisiyyah became enshrined in Muslim collective memory as a symbol of the successes of early Islamic history . Already during the period of the Crusades , Muslim leaders referred to Qādisiyyah as a point of reference to which they compared their own achievements . Academic studies of the narratives of Qādisiyyah and other early Islamic battles have revealed numerous topoi that make up a common schema of the Arab - Muslim conquests ; the generation of these literary layers seems to have begun immediately , as story - tellers ( quṣṣāṣ ) embellished their narrative in order to create an entertaining story or to glorify past ancestors .

		CONTEXT=The 43rd Guards Rifle Division was formed as an elite infantry division of the Red Army in October , 1942 , based on the 1st formation of the 201st Rifle Division , and served in that role until after the end of the Great Patriotic War .

Formed in Northwestern Front , its initial service was in the dismal fighting around the Demyansk salient until that was evacuated by German Army Group North in February , 1943 . Through the rest of the year it fought in that Front , mostly facing the several German strongpoints in the area of Velikiye Luki . Beginning in January , 1944 the division took part in the offensive that finally drove the German forces away from Leningrad and before the summer offensive , now in 22nd Army of 2nd Baltic Front it provided a cadre to form the 130th Latvian Rifle Corps , and it served in that Corps for the duration of the war . Through 1943 and into 1944 the division was able to remain closer to full strength than many other Soviet units because it drew on a relatively large pool of Latvian refugee Communist Party members and Komsomol who had escaped ahead of the Germans in 1941 . It crossed the border back into Latvia in July and entered Riga on October 16 , winning a battle honor in the process . For the duration of the war the 43rd Guards served mostly in Leningrad Front , containing and reducing the German forces trapped in the Courland Pocket , and also engaging in restoration work in its war - battered homeland . It continued to serve in this manner until it was converted to a rifle brigade in April , 1947 .

The Armenian wartime losses of a million , the Adana massacres , and Hamidian massacres had been combined for the sake of what the commission at one point called " justice , " in what appears to have been an attempt to maximize the population count . The Armenian estimates showed the same tendency . At times , they were even reduced to 500,000 when the high Armenian death count endangered the possibility of an Armenian state including Ottoman territory , and in other instances raised to over a million .

		CONTEXT=In 2004 , in an interview on the Australian television programme '' 60 Minutes '' , Wallace-Hadrill aired his opinion about the neglect of the archaeological site of Pompeii . He was described as an " angry archaeologist " when he argued that the conservation issues that need to be acted upon urgently at Pompeii are being neglected and that the site is suffering from a " second death " . Regarding the deterioration of Pompeii , he contends , " Man is wreaking a damage far greater than Vesuvius . The moment of Pompeii 's destruction was also the moment of its preservation . The public needs to understand that unless constant efforts are taken to arrest the decay , the site will , within decades crumble to nothing . " Wallace-Hadrill has made three well-reviewed documentary programmes for BBC television . '' The Other Pompeii : Life and Death in Herculaneum '' , first screened in April 2013 , was described by '' The Arts Desk '' as " a straightforward , lively but informative documentary of substance " on Herculaneum , a Roman city that was destroyed by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD . The two-parter , '' Building the Ancient City : Athens and Rome '' , was screened in August 2015 , and showed how the building of Athens and Rome paralleled the development of democracy in those two cultures . Daisy Wyatt of '' The Independent '' said of it : " An exuberant Wallace-Hadrill made the ... documentary watchable thanks to his passion for the subject . It was hard to feel anything but warmth for the antithesis of the typical Oxbridge academic presenter . "

She started her acting career in a lead role with Vinay Shukla 's '' Koi Mere Dil Se Poochhe '' ( 2002 ) opposite Aftab Shivdasani , with Sanjay Kapoor , Jaya Bachchan and Anupam Kher playing supporting roles . This movie was a box office failure . Deol received mixed reactions from critics upon her performance . Savera R Someshwar of Rediff wrote " Esha , as a person , exudes a confidence that almost borders on arrogance . She 's athletic and seems perfectly capable of looking after herself in any situation . Esha , on screen , is required to convey three emotions : Love , sorrow and fear . Especially fear . No wonder she flounders . She is just unable to look terrorised . Even her alleged romance with costar Aftab has not helped her shed her stern demeanour in her romantic scenes . " Rakesh Budhu of Planet Bollywood wrote " She is n’t horrible , but given the hype , the demands and of course , comparisons , she surely is n’t up to the mark . Koi Mere Dil Se Poochhe is just plain old mediocre in such a way that you end up noticing the flaws in Esha ’s performance more . Her facial expressions need work , her attitude is beautiful but she seems too stern when it is not required . Of course , she is nowhere close to being a washout and if you are her fan you can appreciate the other aspects of her performances without completely losing faith in her future projects . " Despite mixed reactions and box office failure , Deol won numerous awards for her performance including the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut at the 48th Filmfare Awards

Rachit Gupta from '' Filmfare '' gave the film a rating of 4.5 / 5 , stating , " SS Rajamouli 's much-awaited sequel is the kind of movie Indian cinema should make regularly . It 's the kind of sweeping magnum opus that Indian mythos and culture deserve . It 's the biggest film we have ever made and barring a few minor glitches in CGI , this film is possibly the greatest spectacle you 'll see on a big screen , in your life . " Sangeetha Devi Dundoo from '' The Hindu '' stated , " For the most part , The Conclusion does n't let us take our eyes off the screen . It 's designed to be a cinematic celebration , one that deserves to be watched on the largest screen possible " . Anupama Subramanian of the '' Deccan Chronicle '' gave the film a 3.5 / 5 , praising the acting of the stars while complaining about " the lack of a solid plot ' and called the ending " predictable . " Vishnuprasad Pillai of '' Asianet News '' gave a negative review , writing that the film " offers nothing new ... The writing from KV Vijayendra Prasad fails inspire or to do justice to an epic of such scale , " adding that " the dialogues at times are downright corny and plot developments cringe-worthy . " Dipanjan Sinha of '' Hindustan Times '' gave the film a rating of 3/5 stars , praising the film 's cinematography and special effects , but found faults with some of the female characters . Sinha stated , " Devasena ... starts off as an ace warrior only to be tamed into someone who has to be protected . " Shubhra Gupta of '' Indian Express '' rated the film 2/5 stars , noting problems with pacing and sound , writing , " The background music is relentless , and the pitch at which the declamatory dialogues are delivered is deafening : there were times I felt like closing my ears . " Taran Adarsh of '' Bollywood Hungama '' rates the film 4.5 out of 5 and praises the performance of the cast , writing , " It 's a feast for moviegoers and has the trappings to make all generations its fan . " Meena Iyer from '' The Times of India '' rated it 4/5 , writing : " Just savor it . It is a visual extravaganza that India must feast on ... Prabhas is terrific as father and son . Of course , it is CGI and VFX that grab you in your seat . " Hemanth Kumar from '' Firstpost '' called it " Rajamouli 's epic drama " and rated it 4/5 . Sukanya Verma from '' Rediff '' rated the film 3.5 / 5 , writing the film , " continues its tradition of grandiloquence and magnitude ... high drama , more than spectacle , is what lends its riveting tale of revenge and glory all its wallop and wizardry . " She also praised the film 's cast and director stating , " Equipped with a cast that 's not only in tune with Rajamouli 's vision but knows exactly where to hold back and when to give their all adds to Baahubali 's might . " It was further featured in Rotten Tomatoes ' list of Best Off the Radar Films of 2017 , in which Tim Ryan writes , " '' Baahubali 2 : The Conclusion '' plays like a shotgun wedding between '' Ben Hur '' and '' Kung Fu Hustle '' , seasoned with bits of Shakespeare , Kurosawa , and Buster Keaton , " opining , " it 's a blockbuster that 's both gigantic and lighter than air . " Mike McCahill of The Guardian gave a 4/5 rating and called it " a jaw-dropping blockbuster that combines nimble action with genuine heart " . He also stated , " This production 's triumph is the room it 's granted Rajamouli to head into the fields and dream up endlessly expressive ways to frame bodies in motion . Of the many sequences here primed to cut through jadedness , perhaps the most wondrous is that which finds Baahu guiding Deva mid-battle to shoot three arrows simultaneously – a set piece that speaks both to a love of action , and love in action . The budget 's big , the muscle considerable , but they 're nothing compared with '' Baahubali '' s heart . " Manjusha Radhakrishnan of '' Gulf News '' rates the film 3.5 out of 5 and writes , " This is a sweeping visual spectacle filled with epic battle scenes , clashes between warring troops from Indian mythology and elephants on a rampage , " but further added , " There were times in the second half where you felt the computer-generated graphics took over the story . But all this is new and exotic for Indian cinema . " Shilpa Jamkhandikar of '' Reuters '' writes , " It may not up the ante from the last film , but it does n't let up on the pace either . For an Indian film , that is no mean feat . " J Hurtado of '' ScreenAnarchy '' writes , " It 's a bit daunting because it does begin in media res immediately following the complex actions of the first film , but astute viewers will put together the pieces soon enough . " Kabita Maharana of '' International Business Times '' gave a rating of 4 out of 5 and writes , " From the very first scene , the film is a visual extravaganza . Every frame is meticulously captured by SS Rajamouli and his team . This is the first Indian film hailed for excelling in visual effects . " Simon Abrams of RogerEbert.com gave the film a 4/4 rating and writes the film " is everything I want but rarely get from superhero and big-budget fantasy movie " adding " the fight scenes ... are so creative that they make even the most frequently abused creative shortcuts seem novel , everything from computer-generated imagery ( CGI ) to speed-ramping ... You care what happens to the cast as they , aided by wires , hurl volleys of arrows at disposable minions and CGI animals . " Anita Iyer from '' Khaleej Times '' rates the film 3.5 out of 5 and writes , " What stands out in the film is the powerful star cast . Enough has been said already about the acting prowess of Prabhas but he has an equally supportive cast to hold the film . Ramya Krishna as Sivagami , is known for her impressive acting talent and proves her mettle here . Another veteran , Sathyaraj as Katappa excels and you develop a camaraderie with him . Rana Daggubati is aptly spiteful in his portrayal of the villain ... Nassar , as his father , is busy spewing venom but his role could have been meatier .

		CONTEXT=Some media outlets received the broadcast positively . '' St. Louis Post-Dispatch '' television critic Gail Pennington praised Stewart 's performance as host writing that he " did the Oscars proud Sunday night , turning in a four-star hosting performance that unfortunately made the rest of the show seem sluggish by comparison . " Film critic Roger Ebert said that Stewart was " on target , topical and funny , " and added , " He was as relaxed , amusing and at home as Johnny Carson . " Columnist Ray Richmond of '' The Hollywood Reporter '' commented , " He seemed at times nervous and self-conscious , but on the whole , Stewart delivered with just the right balance of reverence and smugness . " Others media publications were more critical of the show . Television critic Rob Owen of the '' Pittsburgh Post-Gazette '' wrote that Stewart was more " amusing than funny " . He added , " Many of his jokes fell flat with the stars in the Kodak Theatre , and his tendency to bow down before celebrities quickly grew tiresome . " Tom Shales from '' The Washington Post '' commented , " It 's hard to believe that professional entertainers could have put together a show less entertaining than this year 's Oscars , hosted with a smug humorlessness by comic Jon Stewart , a sad and pale shadow of great hosts gone by . " Moreover , he derided the " piles and piles and miles and miles of clips from films present and past " writing that it " squandered the visual luster " of the ceremony . Associated Press television critic Frazier Moore remarked , " Stewart , usually a very funny guy , displayed a lack of beginner 's luck as first-time host ... His usually impeccable blend of puckishness and self-effacement fell flat in the service of Oscar . " He also criticized the decision to play music over the winner 's acceptance speeches calling it " distracting and obnoxious . " The American telecast on ABC drew in an average of 38.94 million people over its length , which was an 8 % decrease from the previous year 's ceremony . Additionally , the show earned lower Nielsen ratings compared to the previous ceremony with 23.0 % of households watching over a 35 share .

On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes , the show holds an approval rating of 43 % based on 30 critics , and summarized , " The 90th Academy Awards played it safe and hit no major snags -- but by clocking in at over four hours , returning host Jimmy Kimmel and company wore out their welcome long before the surprise ending . " Hank Stuever of '' The Washington Post '' marked , " In his second year , Kimmel has shown that the telecast need n't be anything but sharp and sure , with a funny host whose bits are manageable , shareable and – best of all – forgotten . We 're not making showbiz history here ; we 're just trying to get through another Oscar night . " Chief critic David Edelstein of '' Vulture '' wrote , " This was the best , most inspiring , and most sheerly likable Academy Awards telecast I 've ever seen . ... It was also – in terms of the actual awards – among the most disappointing . " '' Vanity Fair '' s , Richard Lawson wrote , " As a host , Kimmel struck a careful , appropriately measured tone ... All told , Sunday 's ceremony did an admirable job of recognizing all the turmoil surrounding it while maintaining the silly , chintzy trappings that so many of us tune into the Oscars for . " CNN 's Brian Lowry quipped , " The Oscars are a big , unwieldy beast , which invariably try to serve too many masters . Yet if the intent was ultimately to maintain a celebratory tone without ignoring either the outside world or the elephant in the room throughout this year 's awards , host Jimmy Kimmel and the show itself largely succeeded . " Others were more critical of the show . Television critic Maureen Ryan of '' Variety '' said , " All things considered , the show had a more or less low-key vibe . Normally it takes about two hours for the numbing effect to set in , but despite host Jimmy Kimmel 's best efforts , Sunday 's telecast started to feel a bit languid and low-energy far earlier . " Television critic James Poniewozik of '' The New York Times '' said , " despite the recent upheaval in Hollywood , the ceremony at large still focused mainly on celebration and glitter literally , in the case of the blinding set , which looked as if the ceremony were encased in an enormous geode . There 's also the perennial problem of bloat . The hitch , of course , is that every part of the show has its constituency . " Darren Franich of '' Entertainment Weekly '' wrote , " What fun we had at this year 's Oscars ! Long show , sure , but where to cut it ? " Writing for '' Deadline '' Greg Evans said , " Did the nearly four-hour running time contain any moments for the Oscar ages ? Probably not . " David Wiegand of the '' San Francisco Chronicle '' wrote , " Even the hope that the noise of clapping might keep the audience at home and in the theater awake , there was little of that for anything except the entrance of actors of advance age . " '' The Oregonian '' columnist Kristi Turnquist wrote , " Was it respectful ? Absolutely . Did it make for kind of a dull , earnest Oscars show ? Yeah , kind of . " Attaining 26.5 million U.S. viewers according to Nielsen ratings , the ceremony 's telecast had a 16-percent drop in viewership from last year 's ceremony and had the lowest U.S. viewership in Oscar history . On March 6 , after the final ratings were confirmed , President Donald Trump took to his Twitter account , saying , " Lowest rated Oscars in HISTORY . Problem is , we do n't have stars anymore – except your President ( just kidding , of course ) ! " . In response , Kimmel also tweeted , saying , " Thanks , lowest rated President in HISTORY .

" A writer for the website Watch With Mothers called the character an asset to '' EastEnders '' , expressing pleasure that the show was trying to appeal to younger viewers , while another called him irritating and zany . A writer for '' The Northern Echo '' wondered if Fatboy , along with Leon and Zsa Zsa , brought a new injection of life into the soap or took away screen time from more established characters , and Caroline Fitton , writing for the '' Daily Mail '' , felt that Fatboy 's style of talking was a bit of a cliché . Grace Dent from '' The Guardian '' changed her opinion of Fatboy over time , saying : Julie Emery from '' Heat '' criticised Fatboy 's fashion sense , especially from the episode broadcast on 12 May 2011 , saying " We know clashing prints are soooooo this season , but really , Fatboy , they do nothing for you .

		CONTEXT=The show received a mixed reception from media publications . On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes , the show holds an approval rating of 43 % based on 30 critics , and summarized , " The 90th Academy Awards played it safe and hit no major snags -- but by clocking in at over four hours , returning host Jimmy Kimmel and company wore out their welcome long before the surprise ending . " Hank Stuever of '' The Washington Post '' marked , " In his second year , Kimmel has shown that the telecast need n't be anything but sharp and sure , with a funny host whose bits are manageable , shareable and – best of all – forgotten . We 're not making showbiz history here ; we 're just trying to get through another Oscar night . " Chief critic David Edelstein of '' Vulture '' wrote , " This was the best , most inspiring , and most sheerly likable Academy Awards telecast I 've ever seen . ... It was also – in terms of the actual awards – among the most disappointing . " '' Vanity Fair '' s , Richard Lawson wrote , " As a host , Kimmel struck a careful , appropriately measured tone ... All told , Sunday 's ceremony did an admirable job of recognizing all the turmoil surrounding it while maintaining the silly , chintzy trappings that so many of us tune into the Oscars for . " CNN 's Brian Lowry quipped , " The Oscars are a big , unwieldy beast , which invariably try to serve too many masters . Yet if the intent was ultimately to maintain a celebratory tone without ignoring either the outside world or the elephant in the room throughout this year 's awards , host Jimmy Kimmel and the show itself largely succeeded . " Others were more critical of the show . Television critic Maureen Ryan of '' Variety '' said , " All things considered , the show had a more or less low-key vibe . Normally it takes about two hours for the numbing effect to set in , but despite host Jimmy Kimmel 's best efforts , Sunday 's telecast started to feel a bit languid and low-energy far earlier . " Television critic James Poniewozik of '' The New York Times '' said , " despite the recent upheaval in Hollywood , the ceremony at large still focused mainly on celebration and glitter literally , in the case of the blinding set , which looked as if the ceremony were encased in an enormous geode . There 's also the perennial problem of bloat . The hitch , of course , is that every part of the show has its constituency . " Darren Franich of '' Entertainment Weekly '' wrote , " What fun we had at this year 's Oscars ! Long show , sure , but where to cut it ? " Writing for '' Deadline '' Greg Evans said , " Did the nearly four-hour running time contain any moments for the Oscar ages ? Probably not . " David Wiegand of the '' San Francisco Chronicle '' wrote , " Even the hope that the noise of clapping might keep the audience at home and in the theater awake , there was little of that for anything except the entrance of actors of advance age . " '' The Oregonian '' columnist Kristi Turnquist wrote , " Was it respectful ? Absolutely . Did it make for kind of a dull , earnest Oscars show ? Yeah , kind of . " Attaining 26.5 million U.S. viewers according to Nielsen ratings , the ceremony 's telecast had a 16-percent drop in viewership from last year 's ceremony and had the lowest U.S. viewership in Oscar history . On March 6 , after the final ratings were confirmed , President Donald Trump took to his Twitter account , saying , " Lowest rated Oscars in HISTORY . Problem is , we do n't have stars anymore – except your President ( just kidding , of course ) ! " . In response , Kimmel also tweeted , saying , " Thanks , lowest rated President in HISTORY . " In July 2018 , the ceremony presentation received eight nominations for the 70th Primetime Creative Arts Emmys

		CONTEXT=The first official Republican convention in Illinois was held on May 29 , 1856 , in Bloomington . Chairman John M. Palmer was elected convention president after his opening address . Nine vice presidents and five secretaries were then elected . The convention nominated Bissell for governor with Francis Hoffmann as lieutenant governor , Ozias M. Hatch for secretary of state , Jesse K. Dubois as auditor , and James Miller as treasurer . Hoffmann was found to be ineligible for his position due to a residency requirement , and John Wood was nominated in his place . The following resolutions defining the party platform were approved : Resolved , That foregoing all former differences of opinions upon other questions , we pledge ourselves to unite in opposition to the present administration and to the party which upholds and supports it and to use all honorable and constitutional means to wrest the Government from the unworthy hands which now control it and to bring it back in its administration to the principles and practices of Washington , Jefferson and their great and good compatriots of the Revolution . Resolved , That foregoing all former differences of opinions upon other questions , we pledge ourselves to unite in opposition to the present administration of the Government ; that under the Constitution Congress possesses the power to prohibit slavery in the Territories ; and that , whilst we will maintain all constitutional rights of the South , we also hold that justice , humanity , the principles of freedom as expressed in our Declaration of Independence and our national constitution , and the purity and perpetuity of our Government require that that power shall be exerted to prevent the extension of slavery into territory heretofore free . Resolved , That the repeal of the Missouri Compromise was unwise and injurious ; an open and aggravated violation of the plighted faith of the States , and that the attempt of the present administration to force slavery into Kansas against the known wishes of the legal voters of that Territory is an arbitrary and tyrannous violation of the rights of the people to govern themselves , and that we will strive by all constitutional means to secure to Kansas and Nebraska the legal guaranty against slavery of which they were deprived at the cost of the violation of the plighted faith of the nation . Resolved , That we are devoted to the Union and will , to the last extremity , defend it against the efforts now being made by the dis-unionists of this administration to compass its dissolution , and that we will support the Constitution of the United States , in all its provisions regarding it , as the sacred bond of our Union and the only safeguard for the preservation of the rights of ourselves and our posterity . Resolved , That we are in favor of the immediate admission of Kansas as a member of this Confederacy under the constitution adopted by the people of said Territory . Resolved , That the spirit of our institutions as well as the Constitution of our country , guarantees the liberty of conscience as well as political freedom , and that we will proscribe no one by legislation or otherwise on account of religious opinions , or in consequence of place of birth . Lincoln delivered the closing address . The speech was purportedly so captivating that no reporter made a record of it . The address has become known as Lincoln 's Lost Speech .

Although Pennsylvania had outlawed slavery , many conservative Pennsylvanians believed that the federal government should not interfere with the institution of slavery .

Seward and states ' rights Democrats like John Tyler also joined the new party . The Whig Party proved more durable than the National Republican Party and , along with the Democrats , the Whigs became one of the two major parties of the Second Party System , which would extend into the 1850s . By 1834 , Webster supporters such as Caleb Cushing , Rufus Choate , Abbott Lawrence , and Edward Everett had begun preparing for his candidacy in the 1836 presidential election . With Clay showing no indication of making another run , Webster hoped to become the main Whig candidate in the 1836 election , but General William Henry Harrison and Senator Hugh Lawson White retained strong support in the West and the South , respectively . Rather than uniting behind one presidential candidate , Whig leaders settled on a strategy of running multiple candidates in order to force a contingent election in the House of Representatives . Webster was nominated for president by the Massachusetts legislature , but Harrison won the backing of most Whigs outside of the South . Although Webster had a far greater reputation as a national figure than Harrison , many Whigs hoped that Harrison 's military record would allow him to replicate Jackson 's 1832 victory . Webster 's chances also suffered from his lingering association with the Federalist Party , his close relationship with elite politicians and businessmen , and his lack of appeal among the broad populace ; Remini writes that the American public " admired and revered him but did not love or trust him .

		CONTEXT=Washington University 's origins were in seventeen St. Louis business , political , and religious leaders concerned by the lack of institutions of higher learning in the Midwest . The effort to found the university was spearheaded by Missouri State Senator Wayman Crow , and Unitarian minister William Greenleaf Eliot , grandfather of the Nobel Prize laureate poet T. S. Eliot . Its first chancellor was Joseph Gibson Hoyt . Crow secured the university charter from the Missouri State Legislature in 1853 and handled further political maneuvering . While Eliot was in charge of raising funds for the university , he accepted the position as President of the Board of Trustees . Early on Eliot was able to solicit some support from the local business community , including John O'Fallon , one of the wealthiest people in St. Louis , even briefly considering naming the university the O'Fallon Institute . However , Eliot failed in securing a permanent endowment . In fact Wash U is unique among other American universities , in not having any prior financial endowment to begin with ; the school had no religious backing , wealthy patron , or government support . Therefore , financial problems plagued the university for several decades after its founding .

		CONTEXT=The Liberty Party was a minor political party in the United States in the 1840s ( with some offshoots surviving into the 1860s ) . The party was an early advocate of the abolitionist cause and it broke away from the American Anti-Slavery Society ( AASS ) to advocate the view that the Constitution was an anti-slavery document . William Lloyd Garrison , leader of the AASS , held the contrary view , that the Constitution should be condemned as an evil pro-slavery document . The party included abolitionists who were willing to work within electoral politics to try to influence people to support their goals . By contrast , the radical Garrison opposed voting and working within the system . Many Liberty Party members joined the anti-slavery ( but not abolitionist ) Free Soil Party in 1848 and eventually helped establish the Republican Party in the 1850s .

		CONTEXT=The background of the Spanish Civil War dates back to the end of the 19th century , when the owners of large estates , called latifundios , held most of the power in a land - based oligarchy . The landowners ' power was unsuccessfully challenged by the industrial and merchant sectors . In 1868 popular uprisings led to the overthrow of Queen Isabella II of the House of Bourbon . In 1873 Isabella 's replacement , King Amadeo I of the House of Savoy , abdicated due to increasing political pressure , and the short - lived First Spanish Republic was proclaimed . After the restoration of the Bourbons in December 1874 , Carlists and anarchists emerged in opposition to the monarchy . Alejandro Lerroux helped bring republicanism to the fore in Catalonia , where poverty was particularly acute . Growing resentment of conscription and of the military culminated in the Tragic Week in Barcelona in 1909 . After the First World War , the working class , the industrial class , and the military united in hopes of removing the corrupt central government , but were unsuccessful . Fears of communism grew . A military coup brought Miguel Primo de Rivera to power in 1923 , and he ran Spain as a military dictatorship . Support for his regime gradually faded , and he resigned in January 1930 . There was little support for the monarchy in the major cities , and King Alfonso XIII abdicated ; the Second Spanish Republic was formed , whose power would remain until the culmination of the Spanish Civil War . Monarchists would continue to oppose the Republic .

		CONTEXT=The first official Republican convention in Illinois was held on May 29 , 1856 , in Bloomington . Chairman John M. Palmer was elected convention president after his opening address . Nine vice presidents and five secretaries were then elected . The convention nominated Bissell for governor with Francis Hoffmann as lieutenant governor , Ozias M. Hatch for secretary of state , Jesse K. Dubois as auditor , and James Miller as treasurer . Hoffmann was found to be ineligible for his position due to a residency requirement , and John Wood was nominated in his place . The following resolutions defining the party platform were approved : Resolved , That foregoing all former differences of opinions upon other questions , we pledge ourselves to unite in opposition to the present administration and to the party which upholds and supports it and to use all honorable and constitutional means to wrest the Government from the unworthy hands which now control it and to bring it back in its administration to the principles and practices of Washington , Jefferson and their great and good compatriots of the Revolution . Resolved , That foregoing all former differences of opinions upon other questions , we pledge ourselves to unite in opposition to the present administration of the Government ; that under the Constitution Congress possesses the power to prohibit slavery in the Territories ; and that , whilst we will maintain all constitutional rights of the South , we also hold that justice , humanity , the principles of freedom as expressed in our Declaration of Independence and our national constitution , and the purity and perpetuity of our Government require that that power shall be exerted to prevent the extension of slavery into territory heretofore free . Resolved , That the repeal of the Missouri Compromise was unwise and injurious ; an open and aggravated violation of the plighted faith of the States , and that the attempt of the present administration to force slavery into Kansas against the known wishes of the legal voters of that Territory is an arbitrary and tyrannous violation of the rights of the people to govern themselves , and that we will strive by all constitutional means to secure to Kansas and Nebraska the legal guaranty against slavery of which they were deprived at the cost of the violation of the plighted faith of the nation . Resolved , That we are devoted to the Union and will , to the last extremity , defend it against the efforts now being made by the dis-unionists of this administration to compass its dissolution , and that we will support the Constitution of the United States , in all its provisions regarding it , as the sacred bond of our Union and the only safeguard for the preservation of the rights of ourselves and our posterity . Resolved , That we are in favor of the immediate admission of Kansas as a member of this Confederacy under the constitution adopted by the people of said Territory . Resolved , That the spirit of our institutions as well as the Constitution of our country , guarantees the liberty of conscience as well as political freedom , and that we will proscribe no one by legislation or otherwise on account of religious opinions , or in consequence of place of birth . Lincoln delivered the closing address . The speech was purportedly so captivating that no reporter made a record of it . The address has become known as Lincoln 's Lost Speech . The delegates to the convention were : The Democrats had nominated Richardson for governor at their convention earlier that month . The remnants of the Whig party declined to run a candidate . The first Republican National Convention met that June , nominating John C. Fremont for president . Fremont was defeated handily in his bid for president , including in Illinois , but the Republican state ticket in Illinois was successful . Bissell became the first Governor from a party other than the Democrats since 1838 . Republicans would win every subsequent gubernatorial election through 1893

		CONTEXT=The first official Republican convention in Illinois was held on May 29 , 1856 , in Bloomington . Chairman John M. Palmer was elected convention president after his opening address . Nine vice presidents and five secretaries were then elected . The convention nominated Bissell for governor with Francis Hoffmann as lieutenant governor , Ozias M. Hatch for secretary of state , Jesse K. Dubois as auditor , and James Miller as treasurer . Hoffmann was found to be ineligible for his position due to a residency requirement , and John Wood was nominated in his place . The following resolutions defining the party platform were approved : Resolved , That foregoing all former differences of opinions upon other questions , we pledge ourselves to unite in opposition to the present administration and to the party which upholds and supports it and to use all honorable and constitutional means to wrest the Government from the unworthy hands which now control it and to bring it back in its administration to the principles and practices of Washington , Jefferson and their great and good compatriots of the Revolution . Resolved , That foregoing all former differences of opinions upon other questions , we pledge ourselves to unite in opposition to the present administration of the Government ; that under the Constitution Congress possesses the power to prohibit slavery in the Territories ; and that , whilst we will maintain all constitutional rights of the South , we also hold that justice , humanity , the principles of freedom as expressed in our Declaration of Independence and our national constitution , and the purity and perpetuity of our Government require that that power shall be exerted to prevent the extension of slavery into territory heretofore free . Resolved , That the repeal of the Missouri Compromise was unwise and injurious ; an open and aggravated violation of the plighted faith of the States , and that the attempt of the present administration to force slavery into Kansas against the known wishes of the legal voters of that Territory is an arbitrary and tyrannous violation of the rights of the people to govern themselves , and that we will strive by all constitutional means to secure to Kansas and Nebraska the legal guaranty against slavery of which they were deprived at the cost of the violation of the plighted faith of the nation . Resolved , That we are devoted to the Union and will , to the last extremity , defend it against the efforts now being made by the dis-unionists of this administration to compass its dissolution , and that we will support the Constitution of the United States , in all its provisions regarding it , as the sacred bond of our Union and the only safeguard for the preservation of the rights of ourselves and our posterity . Resolved , That we are in favor of the immediate admission of Kansas as a member of this Confederacy under the constitution adopted by the people of said Territory . Resolved , That the spirit of our institutions as well as the Constitution of our country , guarantees the liberty of conscience as well as political freedom , and that we will proscribe no one by legislation or otherwise on account of religious opinions , or in consequence of place of birth . Lincoln delivered the closing address . The speech was purportedly so captivating that no reporter made a record of it . The address has become known as Lincoln 's Lost Speech . The delegates to the convention were : The Democrats had nominated Richardson for governor at their convention earlier that month . The remnants of the Whig party declined to run a candidate .

		CONTEXT=In the aftermath of the battle over the national bank , Jackson 's political opponents coalesced into the Whig Party . By taking a name rooted in American and British history , the Whigs implicitly criticized Jackson as a tyrannical executive . Although National Republicans like Clay and Webster formed the core of the Whig Party , Anti-Masonic leaders like William H. Seward and states ' rights Democrats like John Tyler also joined the new party . The Whig Party proved more durable than the National Republican Party and , along with the Democrats , the Whigs became one of the two major parties of the Second Party System , which would extend into the 1850s . By 1834 , Webster supporters such as Caleb Cushing , Rufus Choate , Abbott Lawrence , and Edward Everett had begun preparing for his candidacy in the 1836 presidential election . With Clay showing no indication of making another run , Webster hoped to become the main Whig candidate in the 1836 election , but General William Henry Harrison and Senator Hugh Lawson White retained strong support in the West and the South , respectively . Rather than uniting behind one presidential candidate , Whig leaders settled on a strategy of running multiple candidates in order to force a contingent election in the House of Representatives . Webster was nominated for president by the Massachusetts legislature , but Harrison won the backing of most Whigs outside of the South . Although Webster had a far greater reputation as a national figure than Harrison , many Whigs hoped that Harrison 's military record would allow him to replicate Jackson 's 1832 victory . Webster 's chances also suffered from his lingering association with the Federalist Party , his close relationship with elite politicians and businessmen , and his lack of appeal among the broad populace ; Remini writes that the American public " admired and revered him but did not love or trust him . " With little support outside of his home state , Webster attempted to withdraw his presidential candidacy , but , to his eventual regret , Massachusetts Whig leaders convinced him to stay in the race . Meanwhile , the 1835 Democratic National Convention nominated Van Buren , Jackson 's preferred successor , for president . In the 1836 election , Van Buren won a majority of the popular and electoral vote , Harrison finished a distant second , and White carried two Southern states . Webster won only the electoral votes of Massachusetts . Adding to his displeasure , Webster lost a major Supreme Court decision , '' Charles River Bridge v. Warren Bridge '' , shortly after the election

Williams claimed he " got up the first radical meeting in south Wales " in the autumn of 1836 when he founded Carmarthen Working Men 's Association . This followed on from the foundation the previous year of the London Working Men 's Association by William Lovett and Henry Hetherington , Hetherington was a friend of Hugh Williams and is likely to have influenced his activities in south Wales . The People 's Charter , embodying six points , was published in May 1838 , with an address by Lovett and Hetherington . It became the focus of widespread meetings in support of its objectives throughout Britain . The People 's Charter was later published in Welsh increasing the movement 's appeal in Welsh - speaking areas . Chartism in Wales reached its climax in November 1839 with the Newport Rising and subsequent treason trial of Chartist leaders .

Although Pennsylvania had outlawed slavery , many conservative Pennsylvanians believed that the federal government should not interfere with the institution of slavery . One such individual was Democrat James Buchanan , the last pre-Civil War president . Buchanan 's party had generally won presidential and gubernatorial elections in Pennsylvania . However , the nascent Republican Party 's first convention took place in Philadelphia , and the 1860 elections saw the Republican Party win the state 's presidential vote and the governor 's office . After the failure of the Crittenden Compromise , the secession of the South , and the Battle of Fort Sumter , the Civil War began with Pennsylvania as a key member of the Union . Despite the Republican victory the 1860 election , Democrats remained powerful in the state , and several " copperheads " called for peace during the war . The Democrats re-took control of the state legislature in the 1862 election , but incumbent Republican Governor Andrew Curtin retained control of the governorship in 1863 .

For its year-end list of " The 100 Best Tracks of 2014 " , '' Pitchfork '' ranked the song at number 23 . Also commenting on Lamar , '' Billboard '' 's Chris Payne wrote , " There are n't many A-list rappers who could handle a beat like this , but Kendrick is clearly one of them . " '' Rolling Stone '' editor Jon Dolan gave the song three-and-a-half out of five stars , commenting " Over offhandedly lovely , warp-speed psychedelic soul-jazz , Lamar unleashes a word-mad waterfall with a worried emotional core ( " analyze my demise I say I 'm super-anxious " , he raps ) . " '' Consequence of Sound '' editor Nina Corcoran wrote : " when combined with one of Lamar ’s hottest verses to date ( before '' To Pimp a Butterfly '' ) , the song explodes . But it does n’t stop there . FlyLo shows off his talent by shifting gears post-Kendrick verse the only way you can : insane keys , double-time bass drum , and unrelenting hand claps .

The mourners ca n't see the children as they dance right out of the church and out onto a blacktop , but a group of other kids chases after them as they hop in a hearse and drive away . The clip was featured by several publications on their year-end list of best videos , including '' Pitchfork '' , '' Spin '' , and Stereogumwith the latter listing it at number one . The video received two nominations at the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards : Best Choreography and Best Cinematography , ultimately winning the latter

For centuries , Japan viewed the Ryukyu Islands as one of its provinces . In 1871 the Mudan incident happened : cannibal Taiwanese aborigines murdered 54 Ryūkyūan sailors that had their ship shipwrecked . At that time the Ryukyu Islands were claimed by both Qing China and Japan , and the Japanese interpreted the incident as an attack on their citizens . They took steps to bring the islands in their jurisdiction : in 1872 the Japanese Ryukyu Domain was declared , and in 1874 a retaliatory incursion to Taiwan was sent , which was a success . The success of this expedition emboldened the Japanese : not even the Americans could defeat the Taiwanese cannibals in the Formosa Expedition of 1867 . Very few gave it much thought at the time , but this was the first move in the Japanese expansionism series . Japan occupied Taiwan for the rest of 1874 and then left owing to Chinese pressures , but in 1879 it finally annexed the Ryukyu Islands . In 1875 Qing China sent a 300-men force to subdue the Taiwanese cannibals , but unlike the Japanese the Chinese were routed , ambushed and 250 of their men were killed ; the failure of this expedition exposed once more the failure of Qing China to exert effective control in Taiwan , and acted as another incentive for the Japanese to annex Taiwan .

		CONTEXT=, also known as Nagasaki export coins refer to Japanese mon coins specifically cast for export by the Tokugawa government between 1659 and 1685 during the Sakoku era . Though the inscriptions on the coins often match Chinese coins from the Song dynasty they ’re often cast with different typefaces such as the fact that the Genpō Tsūhō ( 元豊通寳 ) produced at Nagasaki was in Clerical script while the Song dynasty ’s versions were in Seal script and Running script . Due to the success of these coins they ’re often still found in modern day Vietnam and Java , and were copied by contemporary Vietnamese mints as they had become the de facto standard coinage in Vietnam as native production had declined in the 17th century . As the export of gold and silver was banned by the Qing dynasty Japanese merchants were most likely to go to Hanoi and Hội An to gain access to Chinese products causing these coins to start circulating en masse on the Vietnamese market . A special “ 5 elements ” series of Nagasaki trade coins were also cast for export to Taiwan .

		GOLD_MENTION=946 eruption of Paektu Mountain
		CONTEXT=Following the reign of King Seon ( 830 ) , there is no surviving written records of Balhae . Some scholars believe that the 946 eruption of Paektu Mountain may have caused a national level catastrophe leading to its final fall to the Khitan Liao Dynasty , based on records of massive population displacement of Balhae people to the Liaodong peninsula of the Khitan empire and the Korean peninsula of Goryeo . A significant territory of what was used to be Balhae was mostly depopulated , especially around the Paektu volcano , which was at the heart of Balhae territory . Other historians believe that ethnic conflicts between the ruling Goguryeos and underclass Mohe weakened the state . The Khitans were centered in Liaoning and Inner Mongolia , which overlaps Balhae 's purported territories in the west . A Khitan invasion took the capital of Balhae after a 25-day siege in 926 . After defeating Balhae , the Khitans established a puppet state founded by its new Khitan rulers , the Dongdan Kingdom , which was annexed by Liao in 936 . Some Balhae aristocrats were forced to move to Liaoyang , but Balhae 's eastern territory remained politically independent

		CONTEXT=The Imperial Japanese Navy was created in 1868 , initially the officers and sailors who manned the new navy reflected the composition of the Meiji government 's bureaucracy . Samurai who originated from the victorious coalition of south - western domains dominated the navy 's small officer corps . These domains which had led the restoration , particularly Satsuma , also dominated the numbers of recruits sent to the new Naval Academy which had opened in October 1869 . The leadership of the new navy later took steps to reform recruitment into the officer corps , and to establish the creation of a system of recruitment based on merit rather than on class or region . In 1871 , the government announced that applicants would be accepted from the public at large and that entry would be based upon competitive examinations . Eventually , in the words of Arthur Marder , the Imperial Japanese Navy turned out officers of " unquestioned professional competence , fanatical courage , and extraordinary elan " . The IJN molded among the ranks a standard of discipline , self - sacrifice , and devotion to duty that became the envy of all navies in the world . Japan 's later victories at sea , one commentator has observed , " came as much from the training and morale of the average Japanese seaman as from the effectiveness of the navy 's ships or the caliber of its guns " .

The real target of the second attack was General Peter Walls , head of the COMOPS ( Commander , Combined Operations ) , in charge of the Special Forces , including the SAS and the Selous Scouts . Due to the large number of tourists returning to Salisbury a second flight had been dispatched . General Walls received a boarding card for the second flight , which departed Kariba 15 minutes after the doomed aircraft . No one has been brought to trial or charged with shooting down the aircraft due to amnesty laws passed by both Smith and Mugabe . In a television interview not long after the attack on the first aircraft , Nkomo joked about the incident while admitting ZAPU had indeed been responsible . In his memoirs , '' Story of My Life '' , published in 1985 , Nkomo later said , " during that interview , the interviewee had asked about what we used to down the planes and I said stones , jokingly in an attempt to avoid answering the question due to military intelligence which demanded secrecy regarding what type of weapons we had acquired from the Soviet Union .

" Nkomo founded the National Democratic Party ( NDP ) and in 1960 , the year British prime minister Harold Macmillan spoke of the " Wind of Change " blowing through Africa , Robert Mugabe joined him . The NDP was banned by the white minority government and it was subsequently replaced by the Zimbabwe African Peoples Union ( ZAPU ) , also founded by Nkomo , in 1962 , itself immediately banned .

Newly sober John was unhappy with the US cover art ( it reminded him of his old excesses ) , so the 1991 UK release was issued with new cover art and also replaced " You Got ta Love Someone " ( which had already been released on The Very Best of Elton John the previous year ) and " I Swear I Heard the Night Talkin ' " with then - unreleased " Suit of Wolves " and " Understanding Women " , the former a B - side to " The One " and the latter later included as a track on the 1992 album The One . In the US , it was certified gold in June 1992 and platinum in November 2006 . In April 2016 it was certified 2 x platinum by the RIAA .

		CONTEXT=The Zoo TV Tour ( also written as ZooTV , ZOO TV or ZOOTV ) was a worldwide concert tour by rock band U2 . Staged in support of their 1991 album Achtung Baby , the tour visited arenas and stadiums from 1992 to 1993 . It was intended to mirror the group 's new musical direction on Achtung Baby . In contrast to U2 's austere stage setups from previous tours , the Zoo TV Tour was an elaborately staged multimedia spectacle , satirising television and media oversaturation by attempting to instill " sensory overload " in its audience . To escape their reputation for being earnest and overly serious , U2 embraced a more lighthearted and self - deprecating image on tour . Zoo TV and Achtung Baby were central to the group 's 1990s reinvention .

		CONTEXT=Jose F. Promis of AllMusic gave '' The Collection 1982 – 1988 '' two and a half out of five stars and wrote that this album collects most of Dion 's essential recordings from her pre-superstar years , when she was a very young French singer , popular in Canada and France . Promis noted the heavily synthesized Europop of the 1988 Eurovision contest winner " Ne partez pas sans moi " , which was the song that introduced Dion to international audiences , and is a milestone in her career . According to him , many of the songs on this set are fair , and differ from the processed teen pop of the late 1990s because of the ever-present sincerity in Dion 's voice . Highlights include the elegant ballads " Tellement j' ai d'amour pour toi " , " Benjamin " , and " La voix du bon Dieu " , the shimmering " Avec toi " and " Du soleil au cœur ; " and the anthemic " C'est pour vivre " . Other songs almost make the mark , such as the dramatic " La religieuse " , but are marred by sometimes bizarre production , and , in this case , a truly off-putting bridge . Others are sing-song , nursery rhyme-type material , especially " Hymne à l'amitié " and the incredibly 1980s sounding " Hello Mister Sam "

		GOLD_MENTION=major rockslide
		CONTEXT=Highway 3 has existed in Alberta on generally the same alignment since the 1910s , with only relatively minor changes made to a rough road called the Red Trail that had been carved from Medicine Hat to Crowsnest Pass . Difficult terrain on the south shore of Crowsnest Lake was a major obstacle in connecting the road to the British Columbia border . On April 29 , 1903 , a major rockslide buried the town of Frank and killed dozens , blocking the existing Red Trail . Work immediately began to clear the railway of debris , but a new trail north of the slide was created , connecting Frank and Bellevue . By 1906 , a road had been carved through the rock to the south of the railway , replacing the temporary trail . A formal opening of the highway was held on October 8 , 1917 in Blairmore . Officials had aimed for the ceremony to be held in September , but final work on the road had been delayed by the Canadian Pacific Railway who were unhappy with the location at which the highway crossed the railroad , causing the originally surveyed route to be altered . Minister of Public Works Charles Stewart had travelled from Edmonton for the event and stated that the highway was " the only natural route " for a trans-Canada highway , and would be in better condition if not for the difficult economic times . Canada was embroiled in World War I which ended in 1918 , and gravelling of the highway began in the following years

		CONTEXT=The Robert C Hammond was the last sternwheeler built for service on the upper Fraser and Nechako Rivers . She was owned by the Fort George Lake and River Transportation Company , a partnership of George Hammond and his brother . She was launched at the Central Fort George town - site of Fort George on May 22 , 1913 . She was built so that George Hammond , the promoter of Central Fort George , could claim that his community had steamer service . Central Fort George was on the Nechako River and the large sternwheelers owned by the BC Express Company , despite a $ 50 per trip inducement , could rarely call there , as there often were sandbars unless the water was very high . The rival sternwheelers of the South Fort George town - site owned by the Fort George Lumber and Navigation Company were not interested in helping George Hammond promote Central . In 1913 , the Robert C Hammond made several trips on the Nechako as well as working on the route from Soda Creek to Fort George . For one auspicious moment in her short career , she was going to be a Royal Mail Ship for the newly formed Imperial Express Company which had been formed by Mayor JT Robinson of Kamloops and JC Shields of Vancouver , which had won the government mail contract from the BC Express Company .

		GOLD_MENTION=flood of 1977
		CONTEXT=The flood was preceded by rains from March 9 that did not stop until March 22 , 1936 . The storms brought warmer 50 °F ( 10 °C ) weather that was a cause of one stage of flooding and the continuous rains a second cause of flooding . The natural run-off of 1 to 3 inches ( 2.5 to 7.5 cm ) was far surpassed by the deluge of from 10 to 30 inches ( 25 to 75 cm ) of water in the region . The flood came before pending flood control legislation was enacted or any significant flood control measures implemented . The narrowness of the valleys and encroachment of buildings on the river banks contributed to record flooding . By the time nightfall came one-third of the city was under of water and by the time flooding was over twenty-five people lost their lives . The damages , estimated at $ 43 million , made it the worst flood since the flood of 1889 and the event is chronicled at the Johnstown Flood Museum After the flood , sweeping nationwide flood control laws were enacted and from 1938 to 1943 Johnstown saw many projects completed . These measures gave the people the feeling that the area was now " flood free " , and it was touted as such until the flood of 1977

In 1893 the family moved to Tarsus to take up a post at St. Paul 's College . Carmelite by character and situation assumed non-traditional roles overseas . As part of his duties , Thomas left Turkey to raise money or went to surrounding mission stations to support them . In addition to her family responsibilities , she was involved in the activities of St. Paul 's College and the education of women and a supporter of suffrage for unmarried women . After the 1895 massacre at Marash , Carmelite wrote letters describing the events which were published in American newspapers . She reported on deaths , woundings , damage to the schools in Marash and threats to the missionary workers . Her reports were personal , having spent fifteen years among those who were living through the crisis and in one letter , she reported that she and her husband had been warned regarding violence which might spread to Tarsus . By August , the rioting had reached them , though the Christies were not at the school when it was looted . In the face of the ongoing violence , the family fled to Mersina , and eventually Carmelite returned with the children to the United States between 1897 and 1898 for their safety and schooling

		CONTEXT=The Ferris - Haggerty Mine Site was one of the richest components of the Grand Encampment Mining District in Carbon County , Wyoming . The site was first exploited by Ed Haggerty , a prospector from Whitehaven , England , in 1897 when he established the Rudefeha Mine that would later be known as the Ferris - Haggerty Mine on a rich deposit of copper ore . Haggerty was backed by George Ferris and other investors , of whom all but Ferris dropped out . The partners sold an interest to Willis George Emerson , who raised investment funding for improvements to the mine . These facilities included an engineering feat of its day by developing a aerial tramway to carry high grade copper mined at the Ferris - Haggerty Mine ( FHM ) over the Continental Divide to the smelter in Encampment . The tramway was longest aerial tramway the world had ever seen . The mine was eventually acquired by the North American Copper Company for 123 billion . By 1904 the mine had produced $ 1.4 million in copper ore , and was sold to the Penn - Wyoming Copper Company . However , even with copper prices peaking in 1907 , the company had difficulty making a profit from the remote mine site . The company was over-capitalized and under - insured and was suffered devastating fires at the mine site in March 1906 and May 1907 which halted production . Business disputes and a fall in copper prices prevented re-opening of the mine even after it was rebuilt . Machinery was salvaged after a foreclosure in 1913 . A total of 23 million pounds of copper ore was extracted from the mine during its life .

		CONTEXT=Logging in the Sierra Nevada arose from the desire for economic growth throughout California . The California Gold Rush created a high demand for timber in housing construction , mining procedures , and building railroads . In the early days , harvesting of forests were unregulated and within the first 20 years after the gold rush , a third of the timber in the Sierra Nevada was logged . Concern for the forests rose and created a movement towards conservation at the turn of the 19th century , leading to the creation of state and national parks ( Yosemite , Sequoia , and General Grant Grove ) and forest reserves , bringing forest land under regulation . Between 1900 and 1940 , agencies like the U.S. Forest Service and National Park Service regulated the use of the Sierra Nevada ’s resources . The economy boom after World War II dramatically increased timber production in the Sierras using clear - cutting as the dominant form of logging . In addition , the California Forest Practice Act , or the Z'Berg - Nejedly Forest Practice Act was enacted in 1973 to regulate private timberland holdings .

		CONTEXT=The FBI was also notified of large amounts of money that Hasan had wired to charities in Pakistan , but the FBI determined that the money " went to people not related to terrorism " , On November 9 , 2009 , the FBI said that investigators believed Hasan had apparently acted alone . They disclosed that they had reviewed evidence which included the 2008 e-mail conversations but said they did not find any evidence that Hasan had direct help or outside orders in the shootings . According to a November 11 press release , after preliminary examination of Hasan 's computers and internet activity , they had found no information to indicate he had any co-conspirators or was part of a broader terrorist plot " at this point " . Although this was what they stressed were the " early stages " of the review , no contrary conclusions had been reached even after reports that the US government believed that Awlaki had been the target of airstrikes in Yemen , and that on December 26 , 2009 , investigators said that the suspect of the Northwest Airlines Flight 253 bombing admitted that he had attended camps in Yemen where al-Qaeda members including Anwar al-Awlaki had instructed him , blessed the attack , and provided the bomb

		CONTEXT=An unnamed official claimed there was good reason to believe Awlaki " has been involved in very serious terrorist activities since leaving the US in 2002 , including plotting attacks against America and our allies . " US President Barack Obama approved the targeted killing of al-Awlaki by April 2010 , making al-Awlaki the first US citizen ever placed on the CIA target list . That required the consent of the US National Security Council , and officials argued that the attack was appropriate because the individual posed an imminent danger to national security . In May 2010 , Faisal Shahzad , who pleaded guilty to the 2010 Times Square car bombing attempt , told interrogators he was " inspired by " al-Awlaki , and sources said Shahzad had made contact with al-Awlaki over the Internet . Representative Jane Harman called him " terrorist number one " , and '' Investor 's Business Daily '' called him " the world 's most dangerous man " . In July 2010 , the US Treasury Department added him to its list of Specially Designated Global Terrorists , and the UN added him to its list of individuals associated with al-Qaeda . In August 2010 , al-Awlaki 's father initiated a lawsuit against the US government with the American Civil Liberties Union , challenging its order to kill al-Awlaki . In October 2010 , US and UK officials linked al-Awlaki to the 2010 cargo plane bomb plot . In September 2011 , al-Awlaki was killed in a targeted killing drone attack in Yemen . On March 16 , 2012 , it was reported that Osama bin Laden plotted to kill US President Barack Obama

		GOLD_MENTION=Sundance last January
		CONTEXT=On January 27 , 2011 the festival sent 9 filmmakers to 9 cities across the US to screen and discuss their films . The cities and films included : Bob Tourtellotte of Reuters wrote " Sundance 2011 has proven to be exceptionally strong , audiences and filmmakers seem to agree . " Tourtellotte reported that Robert Redford said that three years ago the Sundance Institute " set out to get back to its roots of supporting alternative voices in cinema and he felt like this year that strategy paid off . " Redford said " This year , what has excited me , is I think the quality is increasing in diversity and is increasing in depth . " The AP reported that Redford said it 's " always a relief " when the festival ends because " it 's really exhausting . " Kenneth Turan , film critic for the '' Los Angeles Times '' , wrote " though the festival has gotten ever bigger — and ( thankfully ) more efficient in moving its close to 50,000 attendees in and out of its far-flung theaters — it still retains the scrappy , antic spirit that has animated it from the start . " Turan wrote " One of the paradoxes of Sundance is that the quirkiness and charm around the edges of the festival are not always fully appreciated because so much of the media focus is on the premieres section and the U.S. dramatic competition " which he said " are , frankly , often the weakest parts of the festival . " Turan said " Sundance 's insistence on giving equal weight to documentaries and dramas has made it into as important a nonfiction showcase as any festival in the world ; witness the fact that four out of the five Oscar-nominated docs this year debuted at Sundance last January . " He also wrote that the foreign language film competition " is a strength at Sundance , and yet that field is given even less popular attention than the documentaries . " Peter Knegt wrote that this year 's festival " probably wo n't replicate last year 's Oscar record . " He said " Despite a huge surge in sales , this year 's Sundance slate looks like it might be the least Oscar-friendly in some time . " He noted that the U.S. Dramatic Grand Jury Prize winners have been nominated for Best Picture for two years ( referring to '' Precious '' and '' Winter 's Bone '' ) . Knegt speculated on films that might be nominated for the Oscars . Films he deemed " most likely to succeed " at being nominated included : '' Like Crazy '' for Best Picture , Michael Shannon of '' Take Shelter '' for Best Actor , Elizabeth Olsen of '' Martha Marcy May Marlene '' for Best Actress , Felicity Jones of '' Like Crazy '' for Best Actress , Jessica Chastain of '' Take Shelter '' for Best Supporting Actress , '' Project Nim '' for Best Documentary Feature , '' Page One '' for Best Documentary Feature , and '' The Interrupters '' for Best Documentary Feature . He wrote " It 's reasonable to feel assured that at least one of Sundance 's docs will end up an Oscar nominee , if not two , three or four . " Jada Yuan of '' New York '' magazine wrote " perhaps the biggest highlight of the festival is just how ripe it 's been for acquisitions , with nearly 30 films getting picked up , the most at any Sundance ever . " On " why everyone is suddenly so bullish on independent film " , Owen Gleiberman wrote that the " energy and optimism at Sundance this year was n't just hype . " He said the factors he thought were driving a new evolving vision of the indie film world included : " The deals have n’t gotten cheaper — they 've gotten smarter " , a belief that last year 's new festival director John Cooper and director of programming Trevor Groth " have re-energized the festival , heightening its quality and organizing the movies with a tempting new shape and vision " , video on demand gives distributors a safety net and more confidence , and the audiences for Sundance movies are not going away , saying " The Oscars ... have become a testament to the central place that Sundance movies now occupy . " Redford was happy about the success of the festival , with about 45 films being sold vs 14 in 2010 , an increase of about 220 % . Redford said studios are realizing " there are audiences " for indie films

" In a review for '' The Verge '' , Tasha Robinson lamented the plot details omitted between the film 's three acts , but wrote that " what does make it to the screen is unforgettable . " While discussing the film after its screening at the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival , Justin Chang of the '' Los Angeles Times '' described '' Moonlight '' as " achingly romantic and uncommonly wise , " opining the film to be an early Oscar contender . Chang further wrote : " Barry Jenkins made a film that urges the viewer to look past Chiron 's outward appearance and his superficial signifiers of identity , climbing inside familiar stereotypes in order to quietly dismantle them from within ... '' Moonlight '' does n't say much . It says everything . " Writing for '' The London Review of Books '' in February 2017 , Michael Wood characterized the film as a study of an inherited intergenerational tragedy : Camilla Long of '' The Times '' wrote that the film 's " story has been told countless times , against countless backdrops " , and that the film is not " relevant " to a predominantly " straight , white , middle class " audience . Long was criticized by users on Twitter for the review , and was accused of being homophobic and racist in her writing . Catherine Shoard defended her by pointing out that " critics ' opinions are subjective , and are supposed to be .

A report by CBS claimed that anonymous law enforcement sources suggested a link to video games , which was later dismissed by the Connecticut police , saying that it was " all speculation " . However , the incident prompted a wave of legislative and bureaucratic efforts against violent video games in the following months , including a meeting between US vice president , Joe Biden , and representatives from the video game industry on the topic of video game violence . The official investigation report , released on 25 November 2013 , discussed video games only briefly in the 48-page document and did not suggest they contributed to Lanza 's motive .

In the drama film , she played an anthropology student who returns home to see her injured brother , Henry ( played by Ben Rosenfield ) , and soon begins a romantic relationship with his favorite musician , James Forester ( played by Johnny Flynn ) . Hathaway 's character was initially written as 19 years old , but Kate Barker-Froyland , the film 's writer and director , changed the part to that of an older woman after casting Hathaway . Hathaway says that the reason she decided to produce the film was because of its depiction of the healing power of music and second chances .

'' Song One '' premiered in the U.S. Dramatic Competition at the 30th Sundance Film Festival in January 2014 , and released in theaters the following year to mixed reviews from critics .
