                CONTEXT=Significant security threats have had an ongoing effect on the industry over the past twenty years . Fifty-eight foreign tourists were killed in the 1997 Luxor massacre . The industry was also affected by the September 11 , 2001 , attacks in the eastern United States , the 2004 Sinai bombings , April 2005 Cairo terrorist attacks , the July 23 , 2005 Sharm el-Sheikh attacks , and the 2006 Dahab bombings . Militants have typically been motivated by a combination of Qutbism and opposition to the Mubarak government , therefore attacking foreigners who are generally non-Muslims while diminishing tourist industry income was seen as serving both agendas

The resolution called for : a continued state of belligerency with Israel , ending the Arab oil boycott declared during the Six-Day War , an end to the North Yemen Civil War , and economic assistance for Egypt and Jordan . It is famous for containing ( in the third paragraph ) what became known as the " Three No 's " : " no peace with Israel , no recognition of Israel , no negotiations with it ... " Following the Six-Day War , the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 242 which proposed a peaceful solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict . The resolution was accepted by Israel , Jordan , and Egypt , but rejected by Syria until 1972 – 73 and the Yom Kippur War . To this day , Resolution 242 remains controversial due to conflicting interpretations over how much territory Israel would be required to withdraw from in order to conform with the resolution . Also , after the Israeli occupation of the West Bank following the war , Palestinian nationalism substantially increased . Armed resistance was encouraged from within the newly occupied territories and from the Arab nations that lost in the war

                CONTEXT=The Camp David Accords , the Egypt – Israel Peace Treaty and the aftermath of relations between Israel and Egypt are considered a modern example of a cold peace . After having engaged each other in five prior wars , the populations had become weary of the loss of life , and the negotiation of the Accords and Treaty were considered a high point of the Middle East Peace Process . However , Egyptian popular support for the treaty plummeted following the 1981 assassination of Anwar Sadat and the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon , and perception of the treaty has not recovered in the Egyptian populace ever since . This drop in support for the treaty was not entirely reflected in Egyptian government policy , as from 1981 until his 2011 ouster , Sadat 's successor Hosni Mubarak continued to retain the treaty 's terms , while also playing public sentiment against Israelis and Jews through state media . Following Mubarak 's ouster and the installation of a military junta in power until inauguration of the next civilian government , protesters voiced strong opposition against the 1979 treaty with Israel , and the Israeli response to Palestinian attacks on Israeli civilians and military personnel resulted in the withdrawal of the Egyptian ambassador over the deaths of 5 Egyptian security personnel in the Sinai , ostensibly by either Palestinian militants or Israeli military personnel engaged in a retaliatory air raid on Gaza . The lack of Egyptian support for the 1979 treaty is due in part to panethnic and religious fundamentalist sympathies in Egypt for Palestinian and other Arab Muslim militancies against Israel , a Jewish-majority state currently in conflict over the territory of Israel and the Palestinian territories , as well as Egyptian nationalist sentiment against Israel dating back to before Israel 's independence in 1948 . Furthermore , while most of the letter of both the Accords and the treaty has been maintained , the spirit of normalization which had been intended are perceived as not having been fulfilled

                CONTEXT=To be eligible for award consideration , the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences requires that a film be shown in a theater in Los Angeles County , California , for at least seven consecutive days during which it is advertised in print media . Studios hoping to position a film for some nominations usually satisfy that minimum requirement , then ease them into wide release from then until the nominations and/or awards ceremony . The flexibility this marketing strategy requires means that screens be available , and studios limit their releases of new films during this time to that end . As critic Ty Burr explained in a 2013 '' New York Times Magazine '' article on the mediocrity of new releases in the first month of the year : " T he studios ... know our attention is elsewhere . " New films shown publicly anywhere for the first time after January 1 themselves are ineligible for Oscars until the following year , by which time they will likely have been forgotten by critics , audiences and voters . '' The Silence of the Lambs '' , winner of the 1991 Academy Award for Best Picture , is a rare exception , as the only film in the post-studio era released in the first two months of its year to go on to win that Oscar . Burr calls it " the grand exception to the January Movies Will Never Amount to Anything rule , " and finds that only one other classic of the late 20th century , '' Dr. Strangelove '' , was a January release . The 2017 satirical horror film '' Get Out '' is another example of a movie released in the months of January and February that went on to be nominated for various Academy Awards such as Best Picture , eventually winning one for Best Original Screenplay

At between 6.0 and 6.3 on the Richter scale , it remains the largest earthquake in the history of Massachusetts . No one was killed , but it damaged hundreds of buildings in Boston and was felt as far north as Nova Scotia and as far south as South Carolina . Sailors on a ship more than offshore felt the quake , and mistook it at first for their ship running aground . Many residents of Boston and the surrounding areas attributed the quake to God , and it occasioned a brief increase in religious fervor in the city . Modern studies estimate that if a similar quake shook Boston today , it would result in as much as $ 5 billion in damage and hundreds of deaths . Some discussion has revolved around the idea that this may have been a remotely triggered event from the 1755 Lisbon earthquake or its aftershocks .

To the anonymous Asturian , the destruction of the Emirate of Córdoba is closely linked with the end times . According to Kenneth Baxter Wolf in the introduction to his translation , " The fact that Asturian armies at the time were taking advantage " of the weakness of the Umayyad emirate of Córdoba and " raiding deep into Muslim territory accounts for the overly optimistic estimates of the imminent Christian domination of the peninsula " in the Chronica Prophetica .

The Minister of Agriculture – a communist – pushed for reforms in which peasants were to get larger shares of produce , be allowed to form cooperatives and take over badly used land , and remove the system by which leaseholders ( known as '' " gabelloti " '' ) could rent land from landowners for their own short-term use . Owners of especially large estates were to be forced to sell off some of their land . The Mafia had connections to many landowners and murdered many socialist reformers . The most notorious attack was the Portella della Ginestra massacre , when 11 people were killed and 33 wounded during May Day celebrations on May 1 , 1947 . The bloodbath was perpetrated by bandit Salvatore Giuliano who was possibly backed by local Mafia bosses . In the end , though , they were unable to stop the process , and many landowners chose to sell their land to mafiosi , who offered more money than the government

Still , at the opening , less than one-half of the delegates were committed , and many expected the convention to nominate a compromise candidate like Pennsylvania Senator Philander C. Knox , Massachusetts Senator Henry Cabot Lodge , or 1916 nominee Charles Evans Hughes . No candidate was able to corral a majority after nine ballots . After the convention adjourned for the day , Republican Senators and other leaders , who were divided and without a singular political boss , met in Room 404 of the Blackstone Hotel in Chicago . After a nightlong session , these party leaders tentatively concluded Harding was the best possible compromise candidate ; this meeting has often been described as having taken place in a " smoke-filled room . " The next day , on the tenth ballot , Harding was nominated for president . Delegates then selected Massachusetts governor Calvin Coolidge to be his vice-presidential running mate

Douglas 's support for the concept of popular sovereignty , which called for each individual territory to decide on the status of slavery , alienated many Southern Democrats . The Southern Democrats , with the support of President Buchanan , held their own convention and nominated Vice President John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky for president . The 1860 Constitutional Union Convention nominated a ticket led by former Senator John Bell of Tennessee

                CONTEXT=The Georgia Platform was a statement executed by a Georgia Convention in Milledgeville , Georgia on December 10 , 1850 , in response to the Compromise of 1850 . Supported by Unionists , the document affirmed the acceptance of the Compromise as a final resolution of the sectional slavery issues while declaring that no further assaults on Southern rights by the North would be acceptable . The Platform had political significance throughout the South . In the short term it was an effective antidote to secession , but in the long run it contributed to sectional solidarity and the demise of the Second Party System in the South . Much of the document was written by Charles J. Jenkins , a Whig lawyer and state legislator from Augusta .

                CONTEXT=The first official Republican convention in Illinois was held on May 29 , 1856 , in Bloomington . Chairman John M. Palmer was elected convention president after his opening address . Nine vice presidents and five secretaries were then elected . The convention nominated Bissell for governor with Francis Hoffmann as lieutenant governor , Ozias M. Hatch for secretary of state , Jesse K. Dubois as auditor , and James Miller as treasurer . Hoffmann was found to be ineligible for his position due to a residency requirement , and John Wood was nominated in his place . The following resolutions defining the party platform were approved : Resolved , That foregoing all former differences of opinions upon other questions , we pledge ourselves to unite in opposition to the present administration and to the party which upholds and supports it and to use all honorable and constitutional means to wrest the Government from the unworthy hands which now control it and to bring it back in its administration to the principles and practices of Washington , Jefferson and their great and good compatriots of the Revolution . Resolved , That foregoing all former differences of opinions upon other questions , we pledge ourselves to unite in opposition to the present administration of the Government ; that under the Constitution Congress possesses the power to prohibit slavery in the Territories ; and that , whilst we will maintain all constitutional rights of the South , we also hold that justice , humanity , the principles of freedom as expressed in our Declaration of Independence and our national constitution , and the purity and perpetuity of our Government require that that power shall be exerted to prevent the extension of slavery into territory heretofore free . Resolved , That the repeal of the Missouri Compromise was unwise and injurious ; an open and aggravated violation of the plighted faith of the States , and that the attempt of the present administration to force slavery into Kansas against the known wishes of the legal voters of that Territory is an arbitrary and tyrannous violation of the rights of the people to govern themselves , and that we will strive by all constitutional means to secure to Kansas and Nebraska the legal guaranty against slavery of which they were deprived at the cost of the violation of the plighted faith of the nation . Resolved , That we are devoted to the Union and will , to the last extremity , defend it against the efforts now being made by the dis-unionists of this administration to compass its dissolution , and that we will support the Constitution of the United States , in all its provisions regarding it , as the sacred bond of our Union and the only safeguard for the preservation of the rights of ourselves and our posterity . Resolved , That we are in favor of the immediate admission of Kansas as a member of this Confederacy under the constitution adopted by the people of said Territory . Resolved , That the spirit of our institutions as well as the Constitution of our country , guarantees the liberty of conscience as well as political freedom , and that we will proscribe no one by legislation or otherwise on account of religious opinions , or in consequence of place of birth . Lincoln delivered the closing address . The speech was purportedly so captivating that no reporter made a record of it . The address has become known as Lincoln 's Lost Speech . The delegates to the convention were : The Democrats had nominated Richardson for governor at their convention earlier that month . The remnants of the Whig party declined to run a candidate . The first Republican National Convention met that June , nominating John C. Fremont for president . Fremont was defeated handily in his bid for president , including in Illinois , but the Republican state ticket in Illinois was successful . Bissell became the first Governor from a party other than the Democrats since 1838 . Republicans would win every subsequent gubernatorial election through 1893

                CONTEXT=The first official Republican convention in Illinois was held on May 29 , 1856 , in Bloomington . Chairman John M. Palmer was elected convention president after his opening address . Nine vice presidents and five secretaries were then elected . The convention nominated Bissell for governor with Francis Hoffmann as lieutenant governor , Ozias M. Hatch for secretary of state , Jesse K. Dubois as auditor , and James Miller as treasurer . Hoffmann was found to be ineligible for his position due to a residency requirement , and John Wood was nominated in his place . The following resolutions defining the party platform were approved : Resolved , That foregoing all former differences of opinions upon other questions , we pledge ourselves to unite in opposition to the present administration and to the party which upholds and supports it and to use all honorable and constitutional means to wrest the Government from the unworthy hands which now control it and to bring it back in its administration to the principles and practices of Washington , Jefferson and their great and good compatriots of the Revolution . Resolved , That foregoing all former differences of opinions upon other questions , we pledge ourselves to unite in opposition to the present administration of the Government ; that under the Constitution Congress possesses the power to prohibit slavery in the Territories ; and that , whilst we will maintain all constitutional rights of the South , we also hold that justice , humanity , the principles of freedom as expressed in our Declaration of Independence and our national constitution , and the purity and perpetuity of our Government require that that power shall be exerted to prevent the extension of slavery into territory heretofore free . Resolved , That the repeal of the Missouri Compromise was unwise and injurious ; an open and aggravated violation of the plighted faith of the States , and that the attempt of the present administration to force slavery into Kansas against the known wishes of the legal voters of that Territory is an arbitrary and tyrannous violation of the rights of the people to govern themselves , and that we will strive by all constitutional means to secure to Kansas and Nebraska the legal guaranty against slavery of which they were deprived at the cost of the violation of the plighted faith of the nation . Resolved , That we are devoted to the Union and will , to the last extremity , defend it against the efforts now being made by the dis-unionists of this administration to compass its dissolution , and that we will support the Constitution of the United States , in all its provisions regarding it , as the sacred bond of our Union and the only safeguard for the preservation of the rights of ourselves and our posterity . Resolved , That we are in favor of the immediate admission of Kansas as a member of this Confederacy under the constitution adopted by the people of said Territory . Resolved , That the spirit of our institutions as well as the Constitution of our country , guarantees the liberty of conscience as well as political freedom , and that we will proscribe no one by legislation or otherwise on account of religious opinions , or in consequence of place of birth .

                CONTEXT=The 1860 Republican National Convention nominated Lincoln , a moderate former Congressman from Illinois , as its standard-bearer . The Republican Party platform promised not to interfere with slavery in the states , but opposed the further extension of slavery into the territories . The first 1860 Democratic National Convention adjourned without agreeing on a nominee , but a second convention nominated Senator Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois for president . Douglas 's support for the concept of popular sovereignty , which called for each individual territory to decide on the status of slavery , alienated many Southern Democrats . The Southern Democrats , with the support of President Buchanan , held their own convention and nominated Vice President John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky for president . The 1860 Constitutional Union Convention nominated a ticket led by former Senator John Bell of Tennessee

The Republican Party platform promised not to interfere with slavery in the states , but opposed the further extension of slavery into the territories . The first 1860 Democratic National Convention adjourned without agreeing on a nominee , but a second convention nominated Senator Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois for president . Douglas 's support for the concept of popular sovereignty , which called for each individual territory to decide on the status of slavery , alienated many Southern Democrats . The Southern Democrats , with the support of President Buchanan , held their own convention and nominated Vice President John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky for president . The 1860 Constitutional Union Convention nominated a ticket led by former Senator John Bell of Tennessee

                CONTEXT=The first official Republican convention in Illinois was held on May 29 , 1856 , in Bloomington . Chairman John M. Palmer was elected convention president after his opening address . Nine vice presidents and five secretaries were then elected . The convention nominated Bissell for governor with Francis Hoffmann as lieutenant governor , Ozias M. Hatch for secretary of state , Jesse K. Dubois as auditor , and James Miller as treasurer . Hoffmann was found to be ineligible for his position due to a residency requirement , and John Wood was nominated in his place . The following resolutions defining the party platform were approved : Resolved , That foregoing all former differences of opinions upon other questions , we pledge ourselves to unite in opposition to the present administration and to the party which upholds and supports it and to use all honorable and constitutional means to wrest the Government from the unworthy hands which now control it and to bring it back in its administration to the principles and practices of Washington , Jefferson and their great and good compatriots of the Revolution . Resolved , That foregoing all former differences of opinions upon other questions , we pledge ourselves to unite in opposition to the present administration of the Government ; that under the Constitution Congress possesses the power to prohibit slavery in the Territories ; and that , whilst we will maintain all constitutional rights of the South , we also hold that justice , humanity , the principles of freedom as expressed in our Declaration of Independence and our national constitution , and the purity and perpetuity of our Government require that that power shall be exerted to prevent the extension of slavery into territory heretofore free . Resolved , That the repeal of the Missouri Compromise was unwise and injurious ; an open and aggravated violation of the plighted faith of the States , and that the attempt of the present administration to force slavery into Kansas against the known wishes of the legal voters of that Territory is an arbitrary and tyrannous violation of the rights of the people to govern themselves , and that we will strive by all constitutional means to secure to Kansas and Nebraska the legal guaranty against slavery of which they were deprived at the cost of the violation of the plighted faith of the nation . Resolved , That we are devoted to the Union and will , to the last extremity , defend it against the efforts now being made by the dis-unionists of this administration to compass its dissolution , and that we will support the Constitution of the United States , in all its provisions regarding it , as the sacred bond of our Union and the only safeguard for the preservation of the rights of ourselves and our posterity . Resolved , That we are in favor of the immediate admission of Kansas as a member of this Confederacy under the constitution adopted by the people of said Territory . Resolved , That the spirit of our institutions as well as the Constitution of our country , guarantees the liberty of conscience as well as political freedom , and that we will proscribe no one by legislation or otherwise on account of religious opinions , or in consequence of place of birth . Lincoln delivered the closing address . The speech was purportedly so captivating that no reporter made a record of it . The address has become known as Lincoln 's Lost Speech . The delegates to the convention were : The Democrats had nominated Richardson for governor at their convention earlier that month . The remnants of the Whig party declined to run a candidate . The first Republican National Convention met that June , nominating John C. Fremont for president . Fremont was defeated handily in his bid for president , including in Illinois , but the Republican state ticket in Illinois was successful . Bissell became the first Governor from a party other than the Democrats since 1838 . Republicans would win every subsequent gubernatorial election through 1893

Still , at the opening , less than one-half of the delegates were committed , and many expected the convention to nominate a compromise candidate like Pennsylvania Senator Philander C. Knox , Massachusetts Senator Henry Cabot Lodge , or 1916 nominee Charles Evans Hughes . No candidate was able to corral a majority after nine ballots . After the convention adjourned for the day , Republican Senators and other leaders , who were divided and without a singular political boss , met in Room 404 of the Blackstone Hotel in Chicago . After a nightlong session , these party leaders tentatively concluded Harding was the best possible compromise candidate ; this meeting has often been described as having taken place in a " smoke-filled room . " The next day , on the tenth ballot , Harding was nominated for president . Delegates then selected Massachusetts governor Calvin Coolidge to be his vice-presidential running mate

                CONTEXT=And Japan was eager to take every opportunity . In 1869 they took advantage of the defeat of the rebels of the Republic of Ezo to incorporate definitely the island of Hokkaido to Japan . For centuries , Japan viewed the Ryukyu Islands as one of its provinces . In 1871 the Mudan incident happened : cannibal Taiwanese aborigines murdered 54 Ryūkyūan sailors that had their ship shipwrecked . At that time the Ryukyu Islands were claimed by both Qing China and Japan , and the Japanese interpreted the incident as an attack on their citizens . They took steps to bring the islands in their jurisdiction : in 1872 the Japanese Ryukyu Domain was declared , and in 1874 a retaliatory incursion to Taiwan was sent , which was a success . The success of this expedition emboldened the Japanese : not even the Americans could defeat the Taiwanese cannibals in the Formosa Expedition of 1867 . Very few gave it much thought at the time , but this was the first move in the Japanese expansionism series . Japan occupied Taiwan for the rest of 1874 and then left owing to Chinese pressures , but in 1879 it finally annexed the Ryukyu Islands . In 1875 Qing China sent a 300-men force to subdue the Taiwanese cannibals , but unlike the Japanese the Chinese were routed , ambushed and 250 of their men were killed ; the failure of this expedition exposed once more the failure of Qing China to exert effective control in Taiwan , and acted as another incentive for the Japanese to annex Taiwan . Eventually , the spoils for winning the First Sino-Japanese War in 1894 included Taiwan

The Ryukyu Kingdom became a vassal state of the Satsuma Domain of Japan after the invasion of Ryukyu in 1609 but retained de jure independence until it was transformed into the Ryukyu Domain by the Empire of Japan in 1872 . The Ryukyu Kingdom was formally annexed and dissolved by Japan in 1879 to form Okinawa Prefecture , and the Ryukyuan monarchy was integrated into the new Japanese nobility .

                CONTEXT=, also Disposition of the Ryūkyūs , dispositions relating to the Ryūkyūs , or Annexation of Okinawa , was the political process during the early years of the Meiji period that saw the incorporation of the former Ryūkyū Kingdom into the Empire of Japan as Okinawa Prefecture ( i.e. , one of Japan 's " home " prefectures ) and its decoupling from the Chinese tributary system . [ 10 ] These processes began with the creation of Ryūkyū Domain in 1872 and culminated in the kingdom 's annexation and final dissolution in 1879 ; immediate diplomatic fallout and consequent negotiations with Qing China , brokered by Ulysses S. Grant , effectively came to an end late the following year . [ 11 ] The term is also sometimes used more narrowly in relation to the events and changes of 1879 alone . [ 12 ] The Ryūkyū Disposition has been " alternatively characterized as aggression , annexation , national unification , or internal reform " .
