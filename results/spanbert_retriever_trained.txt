Among the more popular songs on the album were the title track , along with " Saints and Sinners " ( a song about a Vietnam veteran ) , and " Be My Friend " which includes a guitar riff in tribute to Van Morrison 's " Here Comes the Night " ; all of which still feature in Joe Grushecky 's modern live performances . Like the band 's previous two albums , Blood on the Bricks would be praised by critics but largely ignored by the public . Before their next album the band would change their name to simply " The Houserockers " in an attempt to achieve success outside of their native region .

		CONTEXT=Libertarian perspectives on foreign intervention started as a reaction to the Cold War mentality of military interventionism promoted by American conservatives like William F. Buckley Jr. which had supplanted Old Right non-interventionism . The Vietnam War split the uneasy alliance between growing numbers of self - identified libertarians and the Cold War conservatives . Libertarians opposed to the war joined the draft resistance and peace movements and created organizations such as Students for a Democratic Society . The split was aggravated at the 1969 Young Americans for Freedom convention where the burning of a draft card sparked physical confrontations among convention attendees , a walkout by many libertarians , and the creation of antiwar libertarian organizations . Left - libertarians generally oppose foreign interventions and are usually anti-imperialist while right - libertarians also generally oppose all government foreign aid to other nations . In the United States , the Libertarian Party oppose strategic alliances between the United States and foreign nations .

		GOLD_MENTION=2010 AFL Rising Star
		CONTEXT=He arrived at the club as an incredibly shy and underdeveloped personality , a fact that was noted by teammate Trent Cotchin who said though Martin was 18 “ he seemed much younger in some of the ways he behaved . ” Indeed , he struggled initially to adjust to the expectations of professional football . In one incident in the 2010 preseason he was removed from training and verbally reprimanded by club leadership when he was deemed unfit to train after a big night out . Despite these struggles , his on-field development was such that he would still debut in the 2010 season 's opening match , a 56-point Richmond loss against at the MCG . Martin recorded the sixth most disposals of any Tiger ( 18 ) to go along with four marks , three tackles and three clearances . Two weeks later Martin was convicted by the AFL tribunal for a high hit on Sydney 's Josh Kennedy in round 3 . He did not receive a suspension for the incident however , returning to football the following week . After four matches Martin ranked fourth in the league for clearances and eighth for hard-ball gets . Media reports emerged after round 8 that the 18 year old Martin had received a significant contract offer from expansion club the Greater Western Sydney Giants . The offer , which the Herald Sun ’s Mark Robinson claimed to be worth $ 2.4 million over three seasons , would have taken effect in the new club 's first AFL season in 2012 . Martin later said he had never entertained the idea of moving to the start-up club . In round 10 he had gained attention for his on-field efforts again , this time being nominated for the 2010 AFL Rising Star award after a 21 disposal and 11 clearance match against Port Adelaide . Due to his previous tribunal conviction however , Martin was ruled ineligible for the award and thus did not officially place in the end of season award 's points tally . He drew the attention of Sydney coach Paul Roos by round 14 , prompting Roos to send veteran Brett Kirk onto Martin in a tagging role . Despite this extra attention , he still managed to record 18 disposals and a goal in the match at the MCG . After 17 rounds Martin ranked second at the club for clearances and inside 50s as well as third for disposals and contested possessions . At the same time he ranked first among that season 's Rising Star nominees in clearances , contested possessions and inside 50s . He was also fourth for average disposals and fifth for average tackles . In round 19 he was rested by the club before returning to play out the final five matches of the season . He missed just that one game in his debut season and finished the year ranked second at Richmond for clearances and inside 50s , as well as third for both contested possessions and disposals . In addition to winning the Fred Swift Medal for fourth place at the club 's best and fairest night , Martin also received six votes in the Brownlow Medal count that year , the most by any Richmond debutant since Craig Lambert in 1988 . At season 's end he reiterated his commitment to the club ( and rejection of the former GWS overtures ) by signing a two-year contract extension that would keep him at Richmond until the end of the 2013 season . The extension was reported by the Herald Sun to be in the vicinity of $ 400,000-a-year

		CONTEXT=In the first years of the First Intifada ( 1987 – 1993 ) , Hamas violence was directed first at collaborators with Israel and at individuals it considered moral deviants , and then later at the Israeli military .

The first of the suicide bombings that targeted civilians was at Afula on April 16 , 1994 , when a suicide bomber detonated an explosives-laden car next to a bus , killing nine ( including the bomber ) and wounding 50 . The most deadly suicide bombing was an attack on a Netanya hotel on March 27 , 2002 , in which 30 people were killed and 140 were wounded . The attack has also been referred to as the Passover massacre since it took place on the first night of the Jewish festival of Passover at a Seder

		CONTEXT=On 25 July 2005 , Ahmed , while interviewing with Robert Siegel on National Public Radio , said that the suicide bombers of 7/7 had an " identity crisis " and that " unfortunately , our imams and mosques have not been able to communicate the true message of Islam in the language that these young people can understand . " Christopher Orlet of '' The American Spectator '' did not agree with Ahmed 's " identity crisis " . He said , " That 's not an identity crisis , Lord Ahmed , that 's religious psychopathy . That 's a bloodthirstiness that makes Dracula look like a teetotaler . " Ahmed did acknowledge , " the community leaders and religious leaders , who have kept very close contacts with South Asia and the Middle East rather than keeping a good contact with the British society where we live . " On 30 November 2006 , the '' New Statesman '' reported a claim by fellow Muslim and Labour parliamentarian Shahid Malik that Ahmed had campaigned against him during the Dewsbury election in 2005 . He alleged that Ahmed instead backed Sayeeda Warsi , vice-chair of the Conservative Party , the daughter of a personal friend . According to the New Statesman 's report , Warsi " welcomed Lord Ahmed 's support " . The '' New Statesman '' also printed Ahmed 's refutation , saying " I never told any constituent of Dewsbury to vote for the Tories "

		CONTEXT=After the September 11 , 2001 attacks Bakri praised the attackers as " magnificent " , and changed his leanings towards the theology and philosophy of Al Qaeda . Bakri then stated that he had become a Salafi Muslim . Media outlets and British Muslims criticised him for his open support for various international jihadist organisations . On 13 September 2001 , Bakri told the '' Daily Mail '' , " When I first heard about the September 11 , 2001 attacks , there was some initial delight about such an attack . I received a phone call and said , ' Oh , wow , the United States has come under attack . ' It was exciting . " According to '' The Times '' , Bakri was left alone by British law prior to July 2005 despite actions such as an issuing a fatwa " containing a death threat against President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan " because : Bakri , who acts as al-Muhajiroun 's spiritual leader , insisted that his followers obey a " covenant of security " which , while encouraging terror abroad , forbade them from carrying out attacks in Britain . But " the authorities may have been lulled into a false sense of security " , because the covenant was not permanent . In November 2004 Bakri disbanded Al-Muhajiroun , saying that " all Muslims should unite together against a hostile West . " Three months later Bakri said this " covenant of security " was no longer in force having been violated by the British government . " Experts note , " according to the Times , that the July London bombings followed " four months later "

		GOLD_MENTION=the Lockerbie bombing
		CONTEXT=On 4 October 2009 , Fred Halliday , Emeritus Professor of International Relations at the LSE and the School 's leading expert on the Middle East , wrote a memorandum to the LSE Council regarding the proposed cooperation with the Gaddafi Foundation . " I have repeatedly expressed reservations about formal educational and funding links with that country . " While those in favour of accepting the donation argued that " Libya is changing internally , " most informed observers agree that while some of the worst excesses for the moment have ceased , the rights of its people are badly protected . Libya " remains a country run by a secretive , erratic and corrupt elite . " Since 9/11 the Libyan government has reached compromises with the West on a number of issues , notably the Lockerbie bombing and nuclear weapons . Yet tactical changes in foreign policy are not sufficient for the purposes of evaluating political and academic links . There are also ways in which Libyan foreign policy has '' not '' changed : the country continues to call for the destruction of Israel ; Muammar Gaddafi recently called for the abolition of Switzerland , and he receives the leader of the Somali pirates operating off the Horn of Africa as honoured guests of state . Moreover , Libya 's handling of the Lockerbie bombing " has not been characterised by either consistency or clarity , " I have in the past , Halliday noted , defended accepting grants from authoritarian regimes such as the Gulf states , " but there should be clear limits on this , depending on the degree of political and human rights abuses perpetrated with them and on their ongoing foreign policy conduct . " Whitehall and the City are now happy to do business with Libya , but it does not follow that the LSE should do the same . Responsible leaders throughout the Middle East continue to express reservations regarding Libya , including " its more prominent ' liberal ' representatives . " We must remember , Halliday concluded , that the " liberal " wing within a regime such as Libya does not have the function of producing change but its role is instead " to reach compromises with internal hard-liners that serve to lessen external pressure . " A good case in point are the proposals LSE now is considering . It is , as LSE alumni in positions of responsibility in the region caution , " far too early for the School to take this step . " In 2009 , Human Rights Watch was allowed entry to Libya , via Saif al-Islam Gaddafi 's non-profit organization in order to gather facts about the human rights situation there . While HRW reported that there were concerns about the " repressive atmosphere , " they felt there were signs of " improvement " and Sarah Leah Whitson , director of HRW 's Middle East division said that one should not " underestimate the importance of the efforts made so far " by Gaddafi in the realm of human rights in Libya . She also wrote of her official visit that " the real impetus for the transformation rests squarely with a quasi-governmental organization , the Qaddafi Foundation for International Charities and Development " chaired by Gaddafi . She praised Gaddafi for establishing the country 's two semi-private newspapers , and said " it is impossible to underestimate the importance of the efforts made so far . Let 's hope this spring will last . " In January 2011 , HRW criticised other organisations as well as governments that had previously dealt with Gaddafi . HRW Business and Human Rights Director Arvind Ganesan condemned the London School of Economics ( LSE ) for allowing " abusive and corrupt officials or their families to launder their images in exchange for money " . This was later followed by Ganesen saying that " the London School of Economics did not act until Saif al-Islam 's father literally began to kill his own people " . According to NGO Monitor , this was despite the fact that David Held , Co-Director of LSE Global Governance , was partially influenced by Whitson 's remarks regarding her Libyan visit , referring to Saif al-Islam Gaddafi as a reformer

		CONTEXT=Safety has long been a concern in the mining business , especially in sub-surface mining . The Courrières mine disaster , Europe 's worst mining accident , involved the death of 1,099 miners in Northern France on March 10 , 1906 . This disaster was surpassed only by the Benxihu Colliery accident in China on April 26 , 1942 , which killed 1,549 miners . While mining today is substantially safer than it was in previous decades , mining accidents still occur . Government figures indicate that 5,000 Chinese miners die in accidents each year , while other reports have suggested a figure as high as 20,000 . Mining accidents continue worldwide , including accidents causing dozens of fatalities at a time such as the 2007 Ulyanovskaya Mine disaster in Russia , the 2009 Heilongjiang mine explosion in China , and the 2010 Upper Big Branch Mine disaster in the United States . Mining has been identified by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ( NIOSH ) as a priority industry sector in the National Occupational Research Agenda ( NORA ) to identify and provide intervention strategies regarding occupational health and safety issues . The Mining Safety and Health Administration ( MSHA ) was established in 1978 to " work to prevent death , illness , and injury from mining and promote safe and healthful workplaces for US miners . " Since its implementation in 1978 , the number of miner fatalities has decreased from 242 miners in 1978 to 28 miners in 2015

		GOLD_MENTION=purge of the military 's leadership
		CONTEXT=The Red Army 's focus on mobile operations in the early 1930s was gravely disrupted by Stalin 's purge of the military 's leadership . Since the new doctrines were associated with officers who had been declared enemies of the state , the support for them declined . Many large mechanised formations were disbanded , with the tanks distributed to support the infantry . After the German blitzkrieg proved its potency in Poland and France , the Red Army started a frantic effort to rebuild the large mechanised corps , but the task was only partly finished when the Wehrmacht attacked in 1941 . The huge tank forces , powerful only on paper , were mostly annihilated by the Germans in the first months of Operation Barbarossa . Another factor contributing to the initial defeat was that the Soviet post-World War I rearmament effort was started too early , and in 1941 the majority of Soviet equipment was obsolete and inferior to that of the Wehrmacht

		CONTEXT=In May 1943 the division transferred for garrison duties to the Greek island of Cefalonia . After Italy 's surrender to the Allies on 3 September 1943 the divisions commanding general Antonio Gandin was left without clear orders from his superiors . Therefore , Gandin decided to let his soldiers vote on 13 September 1943 as to what to do to next . The troops voted overwhelmingly to fight their former allies the Germans , thus the '' Acqui '' became one of the very few Italian units to actively resist the Germans . The Germans therefore summarily executed over half of the divisions soldiers and all of its officers in revenge during the Massacre of the Acqui Division

" Sava noted that while the episode was humorous , much of the comedy was undercut by the tragic and distressing nature of Finn 's story . Andrew Tran of Overmental argued that " the episode ... dissects vividly that bottomless feeling of midlife wanderlust ... not the road-trippy , running-through-the-fields kind but rather the life-map-disappearing-in-your-hands , what-the-hell-is-next kind . " Tran contended that , through the use of video game tropes , explores the idea that life is ultimately unpredictable that there " is no map that you can make for yourself ( or that anyone can give you ) that can account for everything you ’re going to encounter " . " The Hall of Egress " has been highly lauded by the show 's production staff , with series creator Pendleton Ward in particular naming it as one of his favorites . According to the crew , " It was just so thoughtfully done . " At the 68th Primetime Emmy Awards in 2016 , " The Hall of Egress " was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Short-format Animation .

Already since the early summer of 1943 , German troops had been pouring into Greece , fearing an Allied landing there ( in fact falling victims to a grand-scale Allied strategic deception operation , " Operation Barclay " ) . Soon they became involved in wide-ranging counterguerrilla operations , which they carried out with great ruthlessness , based on their experiences in Yugoslavia . In the course of these operations , mass reprisals were carried out , resulting in war crimes such as at Kommeno on August 16 , the Massacre of Kalavryta in December and the Massacre of Distomo in June 1944 . At the same time , hundreds of villages were systematically torched and almost one million people left homeless

		GOLD_MENTION=
		CONTEXT=The Obice da 149/19 modello 37 was a heavy howitzer which served with Italy during World War II . It was intended to replace Italy 's assortment of World War I - era heavy howitzers , but this was prevented by the prolonged development time and the very slow pace of production . Despite orders totaling 1392 weapons only 147 had been built by September 1942 . There were three models , the 37 , 41 and 42 , differing only in details . The standard tractor was the Trattore SPA TM 40 . While an unremarkable design the Germans liked it enough to keep it in production with the designation of 15 cm sFH 404 ( i ) after the Italian surrender in 1943 . With the same weight it had superior range compared to the German 15 cm sFH 18 . It was used by the Italian army until 1974 .

		GOLD_MENTION=massacre of Italian troops by the Germans
		CONTEXT=The main characters are Antonio Corelli , an Italian army captain , and Pelagia , the daughter of the local physician , Dr Iannis . An important event in the novel is the massacre of Italian troops by the Germans in September 1943 — the Italian Acqui Division had refused to surrender and had fought the Germans for nine days before running out of ammunition . Some 1,500 Italian soldiers died in the fighting , 5,000 were massacred after surrendering , and the rest were shipped to Germany , of whom 3,000 drowned when the ship carrying them hit a mine

		ANSWER=NA_RETRIEVER
		GOLD_MENTION=purge of the military 's leadership
		CONTEXT=The Red Army 's focus on mobile operations in the early 1930s was gravely disrupted by Stalin 's purge of the military 's leadership . Since the new doctrines were associated with officers who had been declared enemies of the state , the support for them declined . Many large mechanised formations were disbanded , with the tanks distributed to support the infantry . After the German blitzkrieg proved its potency in Poland and France , the Red Army started a frantic effort to rebuild the large mechanised corps , but the task was only partly finished when the Wehrmacht attacked in 1941 . The huge tank forces , powerful only on paper , were mostly annihilated by the Germans in the first months of Operation Barbarossa . Another factor contributing to the initial defeat was that the Soviet post-World War I rearmament effort was started too early , and in 1941 the majority of Soviet equipment was obsolete and inferior to that of the Wehrmacht

		CONTEXT=Around the early 16th century , following the construction of the Ribeira Palace beside the Tagus river , the Palace of Alcáçova began to lose its importance . An earthquake occurring in 1531 further damaged the old castle , contributing further to its decay and neglect . In 1569 , King Sebastian ordered the rebuilding of the royal apartments in the castle , intending to use it as his official residence . As part of the rebuilding , in 1577 Filippo Terzi demolished one of the towers near the principal facade of the Church of Loreto . However , many of the works were never completed after the young king 's apparent death during the Battle of Alcácer Quibir . The following Portuguese dynastic crisis opened the way for sixty years of Spanish rule and the castle was converted into military barracks and a prison . On 30 December 1642 , Teodósio de Frias the Younger was appointed master builder to continue the works begun by his father , Luís de Frias , and his grandfather , Teodósio de Frias . This was part of a greater plan by the Spanish forces to recommission the fortification . However , after Portugal regained its independence following the Portuguese Restoration War , the works were taken over by the Portuguese government . On 6 November 1648 , Nicolau de Langres was called upon to take over the design , execution and construction of a new fortification that would surround the Castle of São Jorge and the city walls of Lisbon . In 1650 the military architect Mateus do Couto was named master builder of the project and reconstruction took on a new formality : although the military engineer João Gillot built new walls in 1652 , construction again followed Couto 's plans between 1657 and 1733 . In 1673 , the Soldiers ' Hospital , dedicated to '' São João de Deus '' ( St John of God ) , was installed on the grounds beside the Rua do Recolhimento . At the end of the 17th century the '' Recolhimento do Castelo '' ( " Castle Shelter " ) was constructed along the southeast angle of the courtyard , and in 1733 , new projects were initiated by master Custódio Vieira

		GOLD_MENTION=1896 Sanriku earthquake
		CONTEXT=Slower than normal rupture propagation is associated with the presence of relatively mechanically weak material in the fault zone . This is particularly the case for some megathrust earthquakes , where the rupture velocity is about 1.0 km per second . These tsunami earthquakes are dangerous because most of the energy release happens at lower frequencies than normal earthquakes and they lack the peaks of seismic wave activity that would alert coastal populations to a possible tsunami risk . Typically the surface wave magnitude for such an event is much smaller than moment magnitude as the former does not capture the longer wavelength energy release . The 1896 Sanriku earthquake went almost unnoticed , but the associated tsunami killed more than 22,000 people

		GOLD_MENTION=purge of the military 's leadership
		CONTEXT=The Red Army 's focus on mobile operations in the early 1930s was gravely disrupted by Stalin 's purge of the military 's leadership . Since the new doctrines were associated with officers who had been declared enemies of the state , the support for them declined . Many large mechanised formations were disbanded , with the tanks distributed to support the infantry . After the German blitzkrieg proved its potency in Poland and France , the Red Army started a frantic effort to rebuild the large mechanised corps , but the task was only partly finished when the Wehrmacht attacked in 1941 . The huge tank forces , powerful only on paper , were mostly annihilated by the Germans in the first months of Operation Barbarossa . Another factor contributing to the initial defeat was that the Soviet post-World War I rearmament effort was started too early , and in 1941 the majority of Soviet equipment was obsolete and inferior to that of the Wehrmacht

		CONTEXT=Although filming began in 1987 , the film was released only a year after . It turned out to be a box-office failure but won critical acclaim . Balu Mahendra admitted that he did not expect the film to be a box-office success or a failure , but would have the satisfaction of having made a good film . Archana 's portrayal as a middle-class woman fetched her a lot of accolades from the critics . Chokkalinga Bhagavathar , who played her grandfather , received equal praise . He was a strong contender for that year 's National Film Award for Best Actor , but eventually lost to Kamal Haasan . At the 35th National Film Awards , the film won in two categories – Best Feature Film in Tamil , and Best Actress for Archana . The film was among the 16 films to be screened at the Indian Panorama section of the International Film Festival of India in 1988 . In 2002 , the film was screened at the " Indian Summer " section of the Locarno International Film Festival . In a 2013 review , '' Ananda Vikatan '' called '' Veedu '' to be among the two films that took Tamil cinema to world cinema level . Further , it praised the film for highlighting the plight of Indian middle-class families and the political set up of the nation . It stated '' Veedu '' was one of the few Tamil films that scores good on both content and narration , and also appreciated Balu Mahendra 's directorial skills . Critics praised the film for being more visual and Balu Mahendra 's understanding of cinema as a visual medium . However , the magazine criticised the usage of background score in the film as it felt it lessened the impact of an otherwise good film . S. Theodore Baskaran in his '' The Eye of The Serpent : An Introduction To Tamil Cinema '' states that '' Veedu '' was a " striking departure " from the previous films of Balu Mahendra , as it was devoid of commercial elements like dance , songs , fight and comedy sequences . While analysing Archana 's characterisation , Baskaran noted Balu Mahendra 's penchant for strong characterisation of his female leads . Balu Mahendra had to construct a house which was mean to be a set for the house which was shown in the film . The building which was later fully constructed , now houses the film school started by Balu Mahendra in 2007 . In many interviews , Balu Mahendra had claimed that '' Veedu '' and '' Sandhya Raagam '' were the only films that satisfied him the most as he made these two the least number of mistakes and compromises . The film is widely considered to be one of the finest works of Balu Mahendra . The negative of the film is lost

In previous years , countries that received a top 10 placing were automatically granted a spot in the next year 's final without having to compete in a semi-final , but for 2008 , the EBU changed the automatic qualification regulations so that all countries except the " Big 4 " ( France , Germany , Spain , and the United Kingdom ) and host country , would have to pass through one of two semi-finals . The EBU split up countries with a friendly voting history into separate semi-finals , to give a better chance for other countries to win . Greece and Cyprus had often been accused of favoring each other , with each awarding the other the maximum number of points ( twelve ) at the previous contest . On January 28 , 2008 , the EBU held a special draw which determined that Greece would be in '' Semi-final 1 '' held on May 20 , 2008 in Belgrade , Serbia ; Cyprus was subsequently placed in the second semi-final

		CONTEXT=Hunt starred in Woody Allen 's '' The Curse of the Jade Scorpion '' ( 2001 ) , as an efficiency expert hypnotized by a crooked hypnotist into stealing jewels . Despite the film 's limited success , Roger Ebert asserted : " Hunt in particular has fun with a wisecracking dame role that owes something , perhaps , to Rosalind Russell in '' His Girl Friday '' . " In 2003 , Hunt returned to Broadway in Yasmina Reza 's '' Life x 3 '' , and in 2004 , she starred in the drama '' A Good Woman '' , as a femme fatale in 1930s NYC . '' AV Club '' , in its review for the latter , remarked : " Helen Hunt looks embarrassingly out of place trying to play an infamous seductress " . She played a socialite , as part of an ensemble cast , in Emilio Estevez 's drama '' Bobby '' ( 2006 ) , about the hours leading up to the Robert F. Kennedy assassination . As a member of the cast , she was nominated for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Cast in a Motion Picture but won the Hollywood Film Festival Award for Best Ensemble Cast . Hunt made her feature film directorial debut in '' Then She Found Me '' ( 2007 ) , in which she also starred as a 39-year-old Brooklyn elementary school teacher , who after years is contacted by the flamboyant host of a local talk show , played by Bette Midler , who introduces herself as her biological mother . After first reading Elinor Lipman 's novel , she tried to interest numerous studios in the material , and her unsuccessful efforts led her to begin writing the screenplay and raising funds to produce it herself . Upon its release , Ruthe Stein of the '' San Francisco Chronicle '' observed , " You would think that frontloading '' Then She Found Me '' with so much plot would make it play like a soap opera . But Hunt saves the movie from this fate in two ways . First she turns in a touchingly real performance , the best of her big-screen career . Forget that '' As Good as It Gets '' won her an Oscar . She 's eons better and more realistic in this one ... By directing '' Then She Found Me '' , Helen becomes its savior as well ... Hunt knows when to rein in the Divine Miss M instead of allowing her to go into full Kabuki mode . She also coaxes pitch-perfect performances from Broderick and Firth . " Hunt starred in the dramedy '' Every Day '' ( 2010 ) , as one half of a married couple pulled apart by increasing responsibilities . According to '' Los Angeles Times '' , the film " comes as a reminder of Hunt 's talent for understatement , and a wish to see more of her " . In the biographical drama '' Soul Surfer '' ( 2011 ) , she played the mother of the Hawaiian-born champion surfer Bethany Hamilton , on whose life the film was based . Her first wide release since 2001 's '' The Curse of the Jade Scorpion '' , '' Soul Surfer '' made US$ 47.1 million internationally . Hunt starred as sex surrogate Cheryl Cohen-Greene in '' The Sessions '' ( 2012 ) , alongside John Hawkes and William H. Macy . The role required Hunt to perform multiple scenes of full-frontal nudity , on which she further said : " Being naked was challenging , but even more than that was the vulnerability . I felt vulnerable because I was naked . I felt vulnerable because we were having such a vulnerable moment in this character 's life . This was a real journey that someone had gone on , and I wanted to do right by that . " Her performance was acclaimed by critics and earned her several award nominations , including an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress . Todd McCarthy of '' The Hollywood Reporter '' wrote : " Hunt 's performance may be physically bold but is equally marked by its maturity and composure . " Hunt played research geneticist Mary-Claire King in the independent drama '' Decoding Annie Parker '' ( 2013 ) , which was released to a mixed critical response . She wrote and directed the drama '' Ride '' ( 2014 ) , in which she also starred as a mother who travels cross-country to California to be with her son after he decides to drop out of school and become a surfer . Rotten Tomatoes ' critical consensus read : " '' Ride '' reaffirms Helen Hunt 's immense acting talent — but suggests that she still needs time to develop as a director . " In '' The Miracle Season '' ( 2018 ) , based on the true story of the Iowa City West High School volleyball team , Hunt played Kathy Bresnahan , a volleyball coach

But the chorus opens up to turn into something less Police-y and more , dare I say it , Bruno Mars-y . " Kitty Empire of '' The Observer '' wrote that the song " channels the Police , but its 21st-century builds owe as much to rave-pop as they do to producer Mark Ronson . It 's an ill-omened meeting that somehow gels . " Jason Lipshut of '' Billboard '' gave a very positive review , stating that " ' Locked out of Heaven ' is Mars ' best solo single to date , with the singer-songwriter yelping about fornication as a tossed salad of chopped guitars and vocal exclamations buttress his sumptuous leading-man act . Sometimes , the perfect lead single is hard to find ; other times , it walks right up to you and delivers a big , cozy hug . " Melinda Newman of HitFix praised " Mars ' singing and the catchy little background vocals , " which according to her , " keep the song moving downstream at a rapid pace . " She also noted that " Even clumsy lyrics like ' your sex takes me to paradise ' ca n’t diminish that joy that the beats and melody bring .

		CONTEXT=The jazz orchestra dancing in Scandinavia was interrupted by the counterculture of the 1960s , whose influences of left-wing politics and LSD were altering the shape of popular music around the world . In 1967 the first psychedelic and progressive rock groups emerged in Stockholm 's Filips club , including Hansson & Karlsson , the Baby Grandmothers , and Mecki Mark Men . These groups were very popular in the Sweden of the late 60s , with television appearances , sold-out concerts , and tours around Europe . Mecki Mark Men even spent three months in the U.S. where they played big rock music festivals with Sly and the Family Stone , Jethro Tull , Pentangle , Mountain , Grand Funk Railroad , Paul Butterfield , and The Byrds . Aside from this music that blended rock , jazz , and folk music with improvisation and experimentation , Swedish progressive rock , or " progg " as it became known , was also fiercely political . Progg bands would go on to support efforts against war and nuclear power , or protest competitive events like Eurovision , stating , " Music can not be a contest . " The term " dansband " was coined around 1970 , when Swedish popular music developed a signature style with brightly characterized lyrics and catchy melodies . The following decade became the golden era of dansband music , with groups like Thorleifs , Flamingokvintetten , Ingmar Nordströms , Wizex and Matz Bladhs rising to popularity in Sweden . In 1977 , the song " Beatles " , performed by Swedish dansband Forbes , won the Swedish Melodifestivalen 1977 and finished 18th ( last ) in the Eurovision Song Contest 1977

		CONTEXT=Page and Dreja , with a tour of Scandinavia scheduled for late summer 1968 , saw the break-up as an opportunity to put a new lineup together with Page as producer and Grant as manager . Page initially described his vision for the new band as " a new sort of collage of sound " that would include mellotron keyboard while still featuring the guitar . Procol Harum 's B.J. Wilson , Paul Francis and session man Clem Cattini , who had guested on more than a few Yardbirds tracks under Most 's supervision , were considered as drummers . Young vocalist and composer Terry Reid was asked to replace Relf but declined because of a new recording contract with Most and recommended the then-unknown Robert Plant . Plant , in turn , recommended his childhood friend John Bonham as a drummer . Bassist/keyboardist/arranger John Paul Jones – who had worked with Page on countless sessions , including several with the Yardbirds – approached Page and offered his services ; Dreja bowed out to pursue a career as a rock photographer . Rehearsals began in mid-August 1968 ; in early September , Page 's revised Yardbirds embarked as the New Yardbirds on the Scandinavian tour , after which the band returned to the UK to produce the debut Led Zeppelin album

" Matt Cibula of PopMatters further explained the track , writing , " It starts out like an early Police single , with some straight-up '' Reggatta de Blanc '' syncopation and a shockingly good Sting vocal impression . But the chorus opens up to turn into something less Police-y and more , dare I say it , Bruno Mars-y . " Kitty Empire of '' The Observer '' wrote that the song " channels the Police , but its 21st-century builds owe as much to rave-pop as they do to producer Mark Ronson . It 's an ill-omened meeting that somehow gels . " Jason Lipshut of '' Billboard '' gave a very positive review , stating that " ' Locked out of Heaven ' is Mars ' best solo single to date , with the singer-songwriter yelping about fornication as a tossed salad of chopped guitars and vocal exclamations buttress his sumptuous leading-man act . Sometimes , the perfect lead single is hard to find ; other times , it walks right up to you and delivers a big , cozy hug . " Melinda Newman of HitFix praised " Mars ' singing and the catchy little background vocals , " which according to her , " keep the song moving downstream at a rapid pace . " She also noted that " Even clumsy lyrics like ' your sex takes me to paradise ' ca n’t diminish that joy that the beats and melody bring .

He was the team 's leading scorer through 11 games , and averaged 16.8 points and reached double-figures in all non-conference games . However , Hamilton 's average fell to 11.4 points in Pac-12 games , when he shot just 31.2 % on three-pointers . He scored in single figures eight times , including the first three games to start conference play . He scored just two points on 1-for-6 shooting in the conference opener against No. 21 Oregon , when the Bruins suffered their first defeat in an 89 – 87 loss . In the following game , he was held scoreless on 0-for-10 shooting in a 76 – 63 win over Oregon State . After a month-long shooting slump , during which he never divulged a pulled back muscle that required a doctor 's visit , Hamilton made a UCLA record nine three-pointers against Arizona State to tie the mark held by Alford and Jason Kapono . The Bruins won 102 – 80 , and Hamilton finished with a season-high 33 points on 10-for-17 shooting . He cooled off the following game , scoring 14 points on five-of-15 shooting in a 96 – 85 defeat to No. 14 Arizona for the Bruins first home loss of the season .

The '' Los Angeles Times '' Todd Martens commented about the performance : " Things get started in familiar territory , with an Aguilera medley , the first of what is sure to be many whiplash-inducing musical performances this evening . But unlike her MTV VMA run-down , Aguilera backs into " Genie in a Bottle " rather than opening with it . ... Opening with the ballad allowed Aguilera to flex her vocal muscles , but the zipping between songs never allowed her - or her background dancers - to catch a groove "

In the autumn of 1893 , labour conflicts in the cities and the mines came together with the protests and claims of the farmers . The movement reached its greatest breadth in the manifestations against taxes , involving the lowest tiers of the city and the countryside , becoming difficult , if not impossible , to control by its leaders

In 1993 , the ICTY defined rape as a crime against humanity , and also defined rape , sexual slavery , and sexual violence as international crimes which constitute torture and genocide

'' The Seattle Times '' negatively reviewed the film for " exaggerating and sensationalizing " Kemble 's life , while Michael Kilian of the '' Chicago Tribune '' criticized the portrayal of John Quincy Adams as a racist . Kilian did however commend it for depicting the " horrors of slave life on a sea island plantation as every bit as compelling as those contained in the journal Kemble kept and later published in England during the Civil War – a book that helped turn British public opinion against recognition of the South . " Despite its negative reception , the film received several nominations .

		CONTEXT=During the 1980s a number of mainstream Israeli politicians referred to policies of transferring the Palestinian population out of the territories leading to Palestinian fears that Israel planned to evict them . Public statements calling for transfer of the Palestinian population were made by Deputy Defense minister Michael Dekel , Cabinet Minister Mordechai Tzipori and government Minister Yosef Shapira among others . Describing the causes of the Intifada , Benny Morris refers to the " all-pervading element of humiliation " , caused by the protracted occupation which he says was " always a brutal and mortifying experience for the occupied " and was " founded on brute force , repression and fear , collaboration and treachery , beatings and torture chambers , and daily intimidation , humiliation , and manipulation " While the immediate cause for the First Intifada is generally dated to a truck incident involving several Palestinian fatalities at the Erez Crossing in December 1987 , Mazin Qumsiyeh argues , against Donald Neff , that it began with multiple youth demonstrations earlier in the preceding month . Some sources consider that the perceived IDF failure in late November 1987 to stop a Palestinian guerrilla operation , the Night of the Gliders , in which six Israeli soldiers were killed , helped catalyze local Palestinians to rebel

In his speech to the delegations in 1898 he dwelt on the necessity of expanding Austria 's mercantile marine , and of raising the fleet to a strength which , while not vying with the fleets of the great naval powers , would ensure respect for the Austrian flag wherever her interests needed protection . He also hinted at the necessity for European combination to resist American competition

		CONTEXT=The Mystery of Celtic Wood refers to the apparent disappearance without trace of 71 men of the 10th Battalion of the 1st Australian Division during a diversionary attack on German positions in Celtic Wood , near Passchendaele in West Flanders , during the Battle of Poelcappelle ( 9 October 1917 ) in the First World War . Official Army reports of the action state that investigations have failed to account for the fate of 37 men of the 10th Battalion . German records contain no mention of the attack , which led to speculation that the men were massacred and buried in a mass grave . Visitors to the site today are still given this explanation by guides . Rumours persist that the men had simply walked into a mist and disappeared . Some investigators attribute the lack of record of the missing to confusion , mis - reporting and clerical error .

		CONTEXT=During the Armenian Genocide — along with hundreds of other Armenian intellectuals — Komitas was arrested and deported to a prison camp in April 1915 by the Ottoman government . He was soon released under unclear circumstances and experienced a mental breakdown and developed a severe case of posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) . The widespread hostile environment in Constantinople and reports of mass-scale Armenian death marches and massacres that reached him further worsened his fragile mental state . He was first placed in a Turkish military-operated hospital until 1919 and then transferred to psychiatric hospitals in Paris , where he spent the last years of his life in agony . Komitas is widely seen as a martyr of the genocide and has been depicted as one of the main symbols of the Armenian Genocide in art

		CONTEXT=The first feature film Ján Kadár and Elmar Klos were able to make in five years showed a decided return to classical black-and-white filmmaking with barely a trace of Kadár 's more experimental work at the '' Laterna magika '' . A gradual relaxation of communist control in Czechoslovakia , whose first signs came from Slovakia , enabled the Bratislava journalist and writer Ladislav Mňačko to publish his novel '' Death Is Called Engelchen '' ( '' Smrť sa volá Engelchen '' , 1959 ) and Kadár and Klos to reach for it from Prague after their suspension was over . The novel and their film '' Death is Called Engelchen '' ( , , 1963 ) spotlighted a new take on the massive pro-democratic Slovak revolt of 1944 that had previously been portrayed only as invariably glorious . It showed some of its aspects that brought about human tragedy . The film was entered into the 3rd Moscow International Film Festival where it won a Golden Prize . The directors ' next film , '' Accused '' aka '' Defendant '' ( '' Obžalovaný '' , 1964 ) , rehashed the propagandist structures of the earlier Socialist-Realist filmmaking , but turned them around by replacing the content mandated in the 1950s with committed social criticism that was quickly becoming one of the hallmarks of Slovak and Czech cinema of the 1960s

		GOLD_MENTION=first Republican National Convention
		CONTEXT=The first official Republican convention in Illinois was held on May 29 , 1856 , in Bloomington . Chairman John M. Palmer was elected convention president after his opening address . Nine vice presidents and five secretaries were then elected . The convention nominated Bissell for governor with Francis Hoffmann as lieutenant governor , Ozias M. Hatch for secretary of state , Jesse K. Dubois as auditor , and James Miller as treasurer . Hoffmann was found to be ineligible for his position due to a residency requirement , and John Wood was nominated in his place . The following resolutions defining the party platform were approved : Resolved , That foregoing all former differences of opinions upon other questions , we pledge ourselves to unite in opposition to the present administration and to the party which upholds and supports it and to use all honorable and constitutional means to wrest the Government from the unworthy hands which now control it and to bring it back in its administration to the principles and practices of Washington , Jefferson and their great and good compatriots of the Revolution . Resolved , That foregoing all former differences of opinions upon other questions , we pledge ourselves to unite in opposition to the present administration of the Government ; that under the Constitution Congress possesses the power to prohibit slavery in the Territories ; and that , whilst we will maintain all constitutional rights of the South , we also hold that justice , humanity , the principles of freedom as expressed in our Declaration of Independence and our national constitution , and the purity and perpetuity of our Government require that that power shall be exerted to prevent the extension of slavery into territory heretofore free . Resolved , That the repeal of the Missouri Compromise was unwise and injurious ; an open and aggravated violation of the plighted faith of the States , and that the attempt of the present administration to force slavery into Kansas against the known wishes of the legal voters of that Territory is an arbitrary and tyrannous violation of the rights of the people to govern themselves , and that we will strive by all constitutional means to secure to Kansas and Nebraska the legal guaranty against slavery of which they were deprived at the cost of the violation of the plighted faith of the nation . Resolved , That we are devoted to the Union and will , to the last extremity , defend it against the efforts now being made by the dis-unionists of this administration to compass its dissolution , and that we will support the Constitution of the United States , in all its provisions regarding it , as the sacred bond of our Union and the only safeguard for the preservation of the rights of ourselves and our posterity . Resolved , That we are in favor of the immediate admission of Kansas as a member of this Confederacy under the constitution adopted by the people of said Territory . Resolved , That the spirit of our institutions as well as the Constitution of our country , guarantees the liberty of conscience as well as political freedom , and that we will proscribe no one by legislation or otherwise on account of religious opinions , or in consequence of place of birth . Lincoln delivered the closing address . The speech was purportedly so captivating that no reporter made a record of it . The address has become known as Lincoln 's Lost Speech . The delegates to the convention were : The Democrats had nominated Richardson for governor at their convention earlier that month . The remnants of the Whig party declined to run a candidate . The first Republican National Convention met that June , nominating John C. Fremont for president . Fremont was defeated handily in his bid for president , including in Illinois , but the Republican state ticket in Illinois was successful . Bissell became the first Governor from a party other than the Democrats since 1838 . Republicans would win every subsequent gubernatorial election through 1893

		GOLD_MENTION=Republican Presidential nomination
		CONTEXT=While the early scenes of Lincoln 's life are remarkably accurate , much of the later scenes contain historical inaccuracies . The famous Lincoln-Douglas debates , in addition to the historically accurate topic of the extension of slavery , have been turned into an argument about secession . Lincoln was famously an underdog for the Republican Presidential nomination in 1860 ; in the film it is suggested he is the sole nominee as a result of the Lincoln-Douglas debates . The outbreak of the Civil War seems to be the Union firing on Charleston , South Carolina from Fort Sumter , rather than the other way around . Also , early in hostilities , General Winfield Scott is depicted as being overconfident of a quick victory ( and something of a buffoon ) , when in reality he was one of the voices in the minority claiming the war would be long , costly , and bloody . Lincoln receives a report from the Secret Service that some copperheads in the North have issued threats against him . The Secret Service was not created until two months after Lincoln 's death . Finally , in the climax of the film , Lincoln delivers a conflation of famous words from the Gettysburg Address and Second Inaugural Address at Ford 's Theatre on April 14 , 1865 – just moments before being assassinated . This was Griffith 's second portrayal of Lincoln 's assassination , the first being in '' The Birth of a Nation ''

		CONTEXT=During the 1840s , Bowser painted banners for a diverse range of clients , including the Know Nothing Party , and received a commission to paint the portrait of prominent abolitionist and real estate developer Jacob C. White . Active in that decade 's efforts to repeal the clause in Pennsylvania 's Constitution which prohibited blacks from voting , Bowser and his family also became so involved with the abolition movement that their home became a stop on the Underground Railroad . In 1858 , politics and advocacy merged with art when Bower painted the portrait of abolitionist John Brown while Brown was visiting the Bowser home . During this same period , Bowser also completed work on his painting , '' The Firebell in the Night '' . In addition , he was also active , during this phase of his life , with the Grand United Order of Odd Fellows . As Grand Master of the Order in Philadelphia , he delivered the keynote address at the Annual Moveable Committee of the G.U.O. of O.F. in Toronto , Canada on October 17 , 1859 as its members celebrated the organization 's thirteenth anniversary . According to news reports , he was " listened to throughout with much attention , and was frequently rapturously applauded " as he " defined in eloquent terms the nature of the work of Odd Fellows — especially that great and leading principle , Charity , " and " remarked upon the practical good effected by Odd Fellowship , in alleviating distress and bestowing many of the comforts of life upon the aged and infirm of the Order , as well as conferring benefactions upon the widow and orphan . " Bowser 's work on the first banner was paid for through a commission awarded by the Contraband Relief Association ( CRA ) , an organization headed by Elizabeth Keckley , the formerly enslaved woman who became Mary Todd Lincoln 's dressmaker . It was then presented by the CRA to the leaders of 1st United States Colored Infantry . With respect to the other Bowser-designed battle flags , historians at the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission note that : " The 127th and 3rd regiments marched carrying banners reading ' We will prove ourselves men ' and ' Rather Die Freemen , Than Live To Be Slaves . ' Beneath these , black soldiers protect white women representing Columbia , the symbol of the republic . The 45th 's banner , proclaiming ' One Cause , One Country , ' shows a black soldier proudly holding an American flag in front of a bust of George Washington as black troops fight in the background . The 24th 's banner shows a black soldier ascending a hill , his arms outstretched in prayer , beneath the words ' Let Soldiers in War , Be Citizens in Peace . ' " For the 22nd USCT banner , Bowser depicted a black soldier pointing " a bayonet at the chest of a Confederate who has allowed his flag to fall and who is tossing aside his sword , " beneath the words , " Sic semper tyrannis " ( " thus always to tyrants " ) , a phrase which would come to have an entirely different meaning two years later when shouted by John Wilkes Booth after his assassination of Lincoln at Ford 's Theater

		CONTEXT=Gibson became involved in politics as a member of the Whig Party with strong anti-slavery views . During the U.S. Presidential campaign of 1844 , he gave stump speeches for Henry Clay due to the Whig Party 's platform that opposed admitting Texas into the Union because it was a slave state . In the U.S. Presidential campaign of 1848 , Gibson supported Whig candidate , " Rough and Ready " General Zachary Taylor . However , he was concerned about the Whig Party 's lack of opposition to the abolition of slavery and personally visited Henry Clay at his home in Ashland , Kentucky in 1848 to discuss this issue . He lost as a Whig candidate for Ohio Attorney General in 1853 . In 1853 , following the large defeat of the Whig candidate General Winfield Scott in the U.S. Presidential election of 1852 , Gibson threw his support to the Free Soil Party and began organizing what would become the Republican Party in Ohio . He attended the first organization meeting of the Republican Party in spring of 1856 in Pittsburgh . He was one of the 69 Ohio delegates ( of a total 600 delegates from around the country ) that attended the first Republican National Convention held in Philadelphia in June 1856 . In 1856 , he ran and was elected as the first Republican to hold the office of Ohio State Treasurer

		CONTEXT=During the 1840s , Bowser painted banners for a diverse range of clients , including the Know Nothing Party , and received a commission to paint the portrait of prominent abolitionist and real estate developer Jacob C. White . Active in that decade 's efforts to repeal the clause in Pennsylvania 's Constitution which prohibited blacks from voting , Bowser and his family also became so involved with the abolition movement that their home became a stop on the Underground Railroad . In 1858 , politics and advocacy merged with art when Bower painted the portrait of abolitionist John Brown while Brown was visiting the Bowser home . During this same period , Bowser also completed work on his painting , '' The Firebell in the Night '' . In addition , he was also active , during this phase of his life , with the Grand United Order of Odd Fellows . As Grand Master of the Order in Philadelphia , he delivered the keynote address at the Annual Moveable Committee of the G.U.O. of O.F. in Toronto , Canada on October 17 , 1859 as its members celebrated the organization 's thirteenth anniversary . According to news reports , he was " listened to throughout with much attention , and was frequently rapturously applauded " as he " defined in eloquent terms the nature of the work of Odd Fellows — especially that great and leading principle , Charity , " and " remarked upon the practical good effected by Odd Fellowship , in alleviating distress and bestowing many of the comforts of life upon the aged and infirm of the Order , as well as conferring benefactions upon the widow and orphan . " Bowser 's work on the first banner was paid for through a commission awarded by the Contraband Relief Association ( CRA ) , an organization headed by Elizabeth Keckley , the formerly enslaved woman who became Mary Todd Lincoln 's dressmaker . It was then presented by the CRA to the leaders of 1st United States Colored Infantry . With respect to the other Bowser-designed battle flags , historians at the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission note that : " The 127th and 3rd regiments marched carrying banners reading ' We will prove ourselves men ' and ' Rather Die Freemen , Than Live To Be Slaves . ' Beneath these , black soldiers protect white women representing Columbia , the symbol of the republic . The 45th 's banner , proclaiming ' One Cause , One Country , ' shows a black soldier proudly holding an American flag in front of a bust of George Washington as black troops fight in the background . The 24th 's banner shows a black soldier ascending a hill , his arms outstretched in prayer , beneath the words ' Let Soldiers in War , Be Citizens in Peace . ' " For the 22nd USCT banner , Bowser depicted a black soldier pointing " a bayonet at the chest of a Confederate who has allowed his flag to fall and who is tossing aside his sword , " beneath the words , " Sic semper tyrannis " ( " thus always to tyrants " ) , a phrase which would come to have an entirely different meaning two years later when shouted by John Wilkes Booth after his assassination of Lincoln at Ford 's Theater

		GOLD_MENTION=first Republican National Convention
		CONTEXT=The first official Republican convention in Illinois was held on May 29 , 1856 , in Bloomington . Chairman John M. Palmer was elected convention president after his opening address . Nine vice presidents and five secretaries were then elected . The convention nominated Bissell for governor with Francis Hoffmann as lieutenant governor , Ozias M. Hatch for secretary of state , Jesse K. Dubois as auditor , and James Miller as treasurer . Hoffmann was found to be ineligible for his position due to a residency requirement , and John Wood was nominated in his place . The following resolutions defining the party platform were approved : Resolved , That foregoing all former differences of opinions upon other questions , we pledge ourselves to unite in opposition to the present administration and to the party which upholds and supports it and to use all honorable and constitutional means to wrest the Government from the unworthy hands which now control it and to bring it back in its administration to the principles and practices of Washington , Jefferson and their great and good compatriots of the Revolution . Resolved , That foregoing all former differences of opinions upon other questions , we pledge ourselves to unite in opposition to the present administration of the Government ; that under the Constitution Congress possesses the power to prohibit slavery in the Territories ; and that , whilst we will maintain all constitutional rights of the South , we also hold that justice , humanity , the principles of freedom as expressed in our Declaration of Independence and our national constitution , and the purity and perpetuity of our Government require that that power shall be exerted to prevent the extension of slavery into territory heretofore free . Resolved , That the repeal of the Missouri Compromise was unwise and injurious ; an open and aggravated violation of the plighted faith of the States , and that the attempt of the present administration to force slavery into Kansas against the known wishes of the legal voters of that Territory is an arbitrary and tyrannous violation of the rights of the people to govern themselves , and that we will strive by all constitutional means to secure to Kansas and Nebraska the legal guaranty against slavery of which they were deprived at the cost of the violation of the plighted faith of the nation . Resolved , That we are devoted to the Union and will , to the last extremity , defend it against the efforts now being made by the dis-unionists of this administration to compass its dissolution , and that we will support the Constitution of the United States , in all its provisions regarding it , as the sacred bond of our Union and the only safeguard for the preservation of the rights of ourselves and our posterity . Resolved , That we are in favor of the immediate admission of Kansas as a member of this Confederacy under the constitution adopted by the people of said Territory . Resolved , That the spirit of our institutions as well as the Constitution of our country , guarantees the liberty of conscience as well as political freedom , and that we will proscribe no one by legislation or otherwise on account of religious opinions , or in consequence of place of birth . Lincoln delivered the closing address . The speech was purportedly so captivating that no reporter made a record of it . The address has become known as Lincoln 's Lost Speech . The delegates to the convention were : The Democrats had nominated Richardson for governor at their convention earlier that month . The remnants of the Whig party declined to run a candidate . The first Republican National Convention met that June , nominating John C. Fremont for president . Fremont was defeated handily in his bid for president , including in Illinois , but the Republican state ticket in Illinois was successful . Bissell became the first Governor from a party other than the Democrats since 1838 . Republicans would win every subsequent gubernatorial election through 1893

		CONTEXT=Prior to and during the Civil War , Pennsylvania was a divided state . Although Pennsylvania had outlawed slavery , many conservative Pennsylvanians believed that the federal government should not interfere with the institution of slavery . One such individual was Democrat James Buchanan , the last pre-Civil War president . Buchanan 's party had generally won presidential and gubernatorial elections in Pennsylvania . However , the nascent Republican Party 's first convention took place in Philadelphia , and the 1860 elections saw the Republican Party win the state 's presidential vote and the governor 's office . After the failure of the Crittenden Compromise , the secession of the South , and the Battle of Fort Sumter , the Civil War began with Pennsylvania as a key member of the Union . Despite the Republican victory the 1860 election , Democrats remained powerful in the state , and several " copperheads " called for peace during the war . The Democrats re-took control of the state legislature in the 1862 election , but incumbent Republican Governor Andrew Curtin retained control of the governorship in 1863 . In the 1864 election , President Lincoln narrowly defeated Pennsylvania native George B. McClellan for the state 's electoral votes

		CONTEXT=President Andrew Jackson declined to seek another term in the 1836 presidential election , but he remained influential within the Democratic Party as his second term came to an end . Jackson was determined to help elect Vice President Martin Van Buren in 1836 so that the latter could continue the Jackson administration 's policies . Van Buren had emerged as Jackson 's preferred successor during the Petticoat affair , and he had been elected vice president in 1832 . With Jackson 's support , Van Buren won the presidential nomination of the Democratic Convention without opposition . Two names were put forward for the vice-presidential nomination : Representative Richard M. Johnson of Kentucky , and former senator William Cabell Rives of Virginia . Southern Democrats , along with Van Buren , strongly preferred Rives , while Jackson strongly preferred Johnson . Again , Jackson 's considerable influence prevailed , and Johnson received the required two-thirds vote after New York Senator Silas Wright prevailed upon non-delegate Edward Rucker to cast the 15 votes of the absent Tennessee delegation in Johnson 's favor

He served one term , 1861 to 1867 , and was chairman of the Committee on Patents and the Patent Office for most of his Senate career . Cowan became a supporter of Andrew Johnson 's plan for post-Civil War Reconstruction , which cost him the support of Cameron 's Republican organization in Pennsylvania .

		CONTEXT=While the early scenes of Lincoln 's life are remarkably accurate , much of the later scenes contain historical inaccuracies . The famous Lincoln-Douglas debates , in addition to the historically accurate topic of the extension of slavery , have been turned into an argument about secession . Lincoln was famously an underdog for the Republican Presidential nomination in 1860 ; in the film it is suggested he is the sole nominee as a result of the Lincoln-Douglas debates . The outbreak of the Civil War seems to be the Union firing on Charleston , South Carolina from Fort Sumter , rather than the other way around . Also , early in hostilities , General Winfield Scott is depicted as being overconfident of a quick victory ( and something of a buffoon ) , when in reality he was one of the voices in the minority claiming the war would be long , costly , and bloody . Lincoln receives a report from the Secret Service that some copperheads in the North have issued threats against him . The Secret Service was not created until two months after Lincoln 's death . Finally , in the climax of the film , Lincoln delivers a conflation of famous words from the Gettysburg Address and Second Inaugural Address at Ford 's Theatre on April 14 , 1865 – just moments before being assassinated . This was Griffith 's second portrayal of Lincoln 's assassination , the first being in '' The Birth of a Nation ''

		CONTEXT=During the 1840s , Bowser painted banners for a diverse range of clients , including the Know Nothing Party , and received a commission to paint the portrait of prominent abolitionist and real estate developer Jacob C. White . Active in that decade 's efforts to repeal the clause in Pennsylvania 's Constitution which prohibited blacks from voting , Bowser and his family also became so involved with the abolition movement that their home became a stop on the Underground Railroad . In 1858 , politics and advocacy merged with art when Bower painted the portrait of abolitionist John Brown while Brown was visiting the Bowser home . During this same period , Bowser also completed work on his painting , '' The Firebell in the Night '' . In addition , he was also active , during this phase of his life , with the Grand United Order of Odd Fellows . As Grand Master of the Order in Philadelphia , he delivered the keynote address at the Annual Moveable Committee of the G.U.O. of O.F. in Toronto , Canada on October 17 , 1859 as its members celebrated the organization 's thirteenth anniversary . According to news reports , he was " listened to throughout with much attention , and was frequently rapturously applauded " as he " defined in eloquent terms the nature of the work of Odd Fellows — especially that great and leading principle , Charity , " and " remarked upon the practical good effected by Odd Fellowship , in alleviating distress and bestowing many of the comforts of life upon the aged and infirm of the Order , as well as conferring benefactions upon the widow and orphan . " Bowser 's work on the first banner was paid for through a commission awarded by the Contraband Relief Association ( CRA ) , an organization headed by Elizabeth Keckley , the formerly enslaved woman who became Mary Todd Lincoln 's dressmaker . It was then presented by the CRA to the leaders of 1st United States Colored Infantry . With respect to the other Bowser-designed battle flags , historians at the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission note that : " The 127th and 3rd regiments marched carrying banners reading ' We will prove ourselves men ' and ' Rather Die Freemen , Than Live To Be Slaves . ' Beneath these , black soldiers protect white women representing Columbia , the symbol of the republic . The 45th 's banner , proclaiming ' One Cause , One Country , ' shows a black soldier proudly holding an American flag in front of a bust of George Washington as black troops fight in the background . The 24th 's banner shows a black soldier ascending a hill , his arms outstretched in prayer , beneath the words ' Let Soldiers in War , Be Citizens in Peace . ' " For the 22nd USCT banner , Bowser depicted a black soldier pointing " a bayonet at the chest of a Confederate who has allowed his flag to fall and who is tossing aside his sword , " beneath the words , " Sic semper tyrannis " ( " thus always to tyrants " ) , a phrase which would come to have an entirely different meaning two years later when shouted by John Wilkes Booth after his assassination of Lincoln at Ford 's Theater

		CONTEXT=Prior to and during the Civil War , Pennsylvania was a divided state . Although Pennsylvania had outlawed slavery , many conservative Pennsylvanians believed that the federal government should not interfere with the institution of slavery . One such individual was Democrat James Buchanan , the last pre-Civil War president . Buchanan 's party had generally won presidential and gubernatorial elections in Pennsylvania . However , the nascent Republican Party 's first convention took place in Philadelphia , and the 1860 elections saw the Republican Party win the state 's presidential vote and the governor 's office . After the failure of the Crittenden Compromise , the secession of the South , and the Battle of Fort Sumter , the Civil War began with Pennsylvania as a key member of the Union . Despite the Republican victory the 1860 election , Democrats remained powerful in the state , and several " copperheads " called for peace during the war . The Democrats re-took control of the state legislature in the 1862 election , but incumbent Republican Governor Andrew Curtin retained control of the governorship in 1863 . In the 1864 election , President Lincoln narrowly defeated Pennsylvania native George B. McClellan for the state 's electoral votes

		CONTEXT=RR Caeli is a double star in the constellation Caelum . It is approximately 66 light years from Earth . It was first noted to be a high - proper motion star in 1955 by Jacob Luyten , and given the name LFT 349 . Discovered to be an eclipsing binary in 1979 , it has a baseline magnitude of 14.36 , dimming markedly every 7.2 hours for an interval of around 10 minutes , due to the total eclipse of the brighter star by the fainter one . Its variability in brightness led to its being given the variable star designation RR Caeli in 1984 . This star system consists of a red dwarf of spectral type M6 and a white dwarf that orbit each other every seven hours ; the former is 18 % as massive as the Sun , while the latter has 44 % of the Sun 's mass . The red dwarf is tidally locked with the white dwarf , meaning it displays the same side to the heavier star . The system is also a post-common-envelope binary , and the red dwarf star is transferring material onto the white dwarf . In approximately 9 – 20 billion years , RR Caeli will likely become a cataclysmic variable star due to the period 's gradual shortening , leading to increasing rates of transfer of hydrogen to the surface of the white dwarf . The white dwarf is likely to have a plain helium core , as its density is too low for the carbon - oxygen core .

		CONTEXT=HD 140283 ( or the Methuselah star ) [ 10 ] is a metal - poor subgiant star about 200 light years away from the Earth in the constellation Libra , near the boundary with Ophiuchus in the Milky Way Galaxy . Its apparent magnitude is 7.205 . It is the oldest star known as of 2021 . The star 's light is somewhat blueshifted as it is moving toward rather than away from the Earth and it has been known to astronomers for over a century as a high - velocity star based on its other vectors ( proper motion ) . An early spectroscopic analysis by Joseph W. Chamberlain and Lawrence Aller revealed it to have a substantially lower metal content than the Sun . [ 11 ] Modern spectroscopic analyses find an iron content about a factor of 250 lower than that of the Sun . It is one of the closest metal - poor ( Population II ) stars to Earth .

		CONTEXT=RS Ophiuchi ( RS Oph ) is a recurrent nova system approximately 5,000 light - years away in the constellation Ophiuchus . In its quiet phase it has an apparent magnitude of about 12.5 . It has been observed to erupt in 1898 , 1933 , 1958 , 1967 , 1985 , and 2006 and reached about magnitude 5 on average . A further two eruptions , in 1907 and 1945 , have been inferred from archival data . The recurrent nova is produced by a white dwarf star and a red giant in a binary system . About every 20 years , enough material from the red giant builds up on the surface of the white dwarf to produce a thermonuclear explosion . The white dwarf orbits close to the red giant , with an accretion disc concentrating the overflowing atmosphere of the red giant onto the white dwarf .

		CONTEXT=Nemesis is a hypothetical red dwarf or brown dwarf , originally postulated in 1984 to be orbiting the Sun at a distance of about 95,000 AU ( 1.5 light - years ) , somewhat beyond the Oort cloud , to explain a perceived cycle of mass extinctions in the geological record , which seem to occur more often at intervals of 26 million years . , more than 1800 brown dwarfs have been identified . There are actually fewer brown dwarfs in our cosmic neighborhood than previously thought . Rather than one star for every brown dwarf , there may be as many as six stars for every brown dwarf . The majority of solar - type stars are single . The previous idea stated half or perhaps most stellar systems were binary , trinary , or multiple - star systems associated with clusters of stars , rather than the single - star systems that tend to be seen most often . In a 2017 paper , Sarah Sadavoy and Steven Stahler argued that the Sun was likely part of a binary system at the time of its formation , leading them to suggest " there probably was a Nemesis , a long time ago " . Such a star would have separated from this binary system over four billion years ago , meaning it could not be responsible for the more recent perceived cycle of mass extinctions , Douglas Vakoch told Business Insider , adding that " If the sun really was part of a binary star system in its early days , its early twin deserves a benign name like Companion , rather than the threatening Nemesis .

		CONTEXT=In the field of astronomy the term chord typically refers to a line crossing an object which is formed during an occultation event . By taking accurate measurements of the start and end times of the event , in conjunction with the known location of the observer and the object 's orbit , the length of the chord can be determined giving an indication of the size of the occulting object . By combining observations made from several different locations , multiple chords crossing the occulting object can be determined giving a more accurate shape and size model . This technique of using multiple observers during the same event has been used to derive more sophisticated shape models for asteroids , whose shape can be highly irregular . A notable example of this occurred in 2002 when the asteroid 345 Tercidina underwent a stellar occultation of a very bright star as seen from Europe . During this event a team of at least 105 observers recorded 75 chords across the asteroid 's surface allowing for a very accurate size and shape determination .

		CONTEXT=He arrived at the club as an incredibly shy and underdeveloped personality , a fact that was noted by teammate Trent Cotchin who said though Martin was 18 “ he seemed much younger in some of the ways he behaved . ” Indeed , he struggled initially to adjust to the expectations of professional football . In one incident in the 2010 preseason he was removed from training and verbally reprimanded by club leadership when he was deemed unfit to train after a big night out . Despite these struggles , his on-field development was such that he would still debut in the 2010 season 's opening match , a 56-point Richmond loss against at the MCG . Martin recorded the sixth most disposals of any Tiger ( 18 ) to go along with four marks , three tackles and three clearances . Two weeks later Martin was convicted by the AFL tribunal for a high hit on Sydney 's Josh Kennedy in round 3 . He did not receive a suspension for the incident however , returning to football the following week . After four matches Martin ranked fourth in the league for clearances and eighth for hard-ball gets . Media reports emerged after round 8 that the 18 year old Martin had received a significant contract offer from expansion club the Greater Western Sydney Giants . The offer , which the Herald Sun ’s Mark Robinson claimed to be worth $ 2.4 million over three seasons , would have taken effect in the new club 's first AFL season in 2012 . Martin later said he had never entertained the idea of moving to the start-up club . In round 10 he had gained attention for his on-field efforts again , this time being nominated for the 2010 AFL Rising Star award after a 21 disposal and 11 clearance match against Port Adelaide . Due to his previous tribunal conviction however , Martin was ruled ineligible for the award and thus did not officially place in the end of season award 's points tally . He drew the attention of Sydney coach Paul Roos by round 14 , prompting Roos to send veteran Brett Kirk onto Martin in a tagging role . Despite this extra attention , he still managed to record 18 disposals and a goal in the match at the MCG . After 17 rounds Martin ranked second at the club for clearances and inside 50s as well as third for disposals and contested possessions . At the same time he ranked first among that season 's Rising Star nominees in clearances , contested possessions and inside 50s . He was also fourth for average disposals and fifth for average tackles . In round 19 he was rested by the club before returning to play out the final five matches of the season . He missed just that one game in his debut season and finished the year ranked second at Richmond for clearances and inside 50s , as well as third for both contested possessions and disposals . In addition to winning the Fred Swift Medal for fourth place at the club 's best and fairest night , Martin also received six votes in the Brownlow Medal count that year , the most by any Richmond debutant since Craig Lambert in 1988 . At season 's end he reiterated his commitment to the club ( and rejection of the former GWS overtures ) by signing a two-year contract extension that would keep him at Richmond until the end of the 2013 season . The extension was reported by the Herald Sun to be in the vicinity of $ 400,000-a-year

		CONTEXT=In 1990 Rafelson directed '' Mountains of the Moon '' , a film about the 1857 – 58 journey of Richard Francis Burton and John Hanning Speke in their expedition to central Africa — the project that culminated in Speke 's discovery of the source of the Nile River . It starred Patrick Bergin as Burton and Iain Glen as Speke , and was hailed by critic Roger Ebert as " completely absorbing . " Ebert continued , " It tells its story soberly and intelligently , and with quiet style ... It 's the kind of movie that sends you away from the screen filled with curiosity to know more about this man Burton . " In '' Newsweek '' , critic Jack Kroll wrote , " The exploits of Sir Richard Francis Burton make Lawrence of Arabia look like a tourist . . . . From scene to scene this film grips you as few movies do , moving between Africa and England to spotlight an extraordinary range of characters in both ' primitive ' and ' civilized ' cultures : from the African tribal chiefs , mild or murderous , to the nabobs of the Royal Geographical Society , honest or treacherous . " Rafelson later observed , " I was very lucky to make that movie . And I can tell you , if there was ever a movie that I enjoyed making , it was that one . " In 1992 Rafelson teamed up with Nicholson and '' Five Easy Pieces '' screenwriter Carole Eastman for the film '' Man Trouble '' . In 1996 he made his last film with Nicholson to date , '' Blood and Wine '' . His most recent films are 1998 's '' Poodle Springs '' and 2002 's '' No Good Deed '' , based on works by Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett , respectively . '' No Good Deed '' was entered into the 24th Moscow International Film Festival

		CONTEXT=Big Star was an American rock band formed in Memphis , Tennessee , in 1971 by Alex Chilton , Chris Bell , Jody Stephens , and Andy Hummel . The group broke up in early 1975 , and reorganized with a new lineup 18 years later following a reunion concert at the University of Missouri . In its first era , the band 's musical style drew on the Beatles , the Rolling Stones , and the Byrds . Big Star produced a style that foreshadowed the alternative rock of the 1980s and 1990s . Before they broke up , Big Star created a " seminal body of work that never stopped inspiring succeeding generations " , in the words of Rolling Stone , as the " quintessential American power pop band " , and " one of the most mythic and influential cult acts in all of rock & roll " . Big Star 's first album — 1972 's # 1 Record — was met by enthusiastic reviews , but ineffective marketing by Stax Records , and limited distribution stunted its commercial success . Frustration took its toll on band relations : Bell left not long after the first record 's commercial progress stalled , and Hummel left to finish his college education after a second album , Radio City , was completed in December 1973 . Like # 1 Record , Radio City received excellent reviews , but label issues again thwarted sales — Columbia Records , which had assumed control of the Stax catalog , likewise effectively vetoed its distribution .

		GOLD_MENTION=S7 Airlines Flight 778
		CONTEXT=Rasputin 's daughter Maria died in the 2006 crash of S7 Airlines Flight 778 , and his wife died six years later . He died in Moscow on 14 March 2015 , a day short of his 78th birthday . Patriarch Kirill of the Russian Orthodox Church conducted his funeral service , and President Vladimir Putin paid his respects . ( In 2014 Rasputin had co-signed a letter by writers in support of Putin 's annexation of the Crimea . ) Rasputin is closely associated with a movement in post-war Soviet literature known as " village prose , " or sometimes " rural prose " ( деревенская проза ) . Beginning in the time of the Khrushchev Thaw ( оттепель ) , village prose was praised for its stylistic and thematic departures from socialist realism . Village prose works usually focused on the hardships of the Soviet peasantry , espoused an idealized picture of traditional village life , and implicitly or explicitly criticized official modernization projects . Rasputin 's 1979 novel '' Farewell to Matyora '' , which depicts a fictional Siberian village which is to be evacuated and cleared so that a hydroelectric dam can be constructed further down the Angara River , was considered the epitome of this genre . The opening paragraph below is a good example of Rasputin 's writing style ( exceptional even for the village prose writers ) , and the novel 's theme of natural cycles disrupted by modernization : '' Once more spring had come , one more in the never-ending cycle , but for Matyora this spring would be the last , the last for both the island and the village that bore the same name . Once more , rumbling passionately , the ice broke , piling up mounds on the banks , and the liberated Angara River opened up , stretching out into a mighty , sparkling flow . Once more the water gushed boisterously at the island ’s upper tip , before cascading down both channels of the riverbed ; once more greenery flared on the ground and in the greens , the first rains soaked the earth , the swifts and swallows flew back , and at dusk in the bogs the awakened frogs croaked their love of life . It had all happened many times before . '' ( From Rasputin 's novel '' Farewell to Matyora '' , translated by Antonina W. Bouis , 1979 ) Rasputin 's nonfiction works contain similar themes , often in support of relevant political causes . He directed particularly trenchant criticism at large-scale dam building , like the project that flooded his own hometown , and water management projects , like the diversion of the Siberian rivers to Central Asia . He argued that these projects were destructive not simply in an ecological sense , but in a moral sense as well

		CONTEXT=The Big Bounce is a hypothesized cosmological model for the origin of the known universe . It was originally suggested as a phase of the cyclic model or oscillatory universe interpretation of the Big Bang , where the first cosmological event was the result of the collapse of a previous universe . It receded from serious consideration in the early 1980s after inflation theory emerged as a solution to the horizon problem , which had arisen from advances in observations revealing the large - scale structure of the universe . In the early 2000s , inflation was found by some theorists to be problematic and unfalsifiable in that its various parameters could be adjusted to fit any observations , so that the properties of the observable universe are a matter of chance . Alternative pictures including a Big Bounce may provide a predictive and falsifiable possible solution to the horizon problem , and are under active investigation as of 2017 .

		CONTEXT=The concept of " curvature of space " is fundamental to cosmology . A space without curvature is called a " flat space " or Euclidean space . Whether the universe is “ flat ″ could determine its ultimate fate ; whether it will expand forever , or ultimately collapse back into itself . The geometry of spacetime has been measured by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe ( WMAP ) to be nearly flat . According to the WMAP 5 - year results and analysis , “ WMAP determined that the universe is flat , from which it follows that the mean energy density in the universe is equal to the critical density ( within a 1 % margin of error ) . This is equivalent to a mass density of 9.9 × 10 − 30 g / cm 3 , which is equivalent to only 5.9 protons per cubic meter . ” The WMAP data are consistent with a flat geometry , with Ω = 1.02 + / - 0.02 .

		CONTEXT=Gnome Press was an American small - press publishing company primarily known for publishing many science fiction classics . Gnome was one of the most eminent of the fan publishers of SF , producing 86 titles in its lifespan — many considered classic works of SF and Fantasy today . Gnome was important in the transitional period between Genre SF as a magazine phenomenon and its arrival in mass - market book publishing , but proved too underfunded to make the leap from fan - based publishing to the professional level . The company existed for just over a decade , ultimately failing due to inability to compete with major publishers who also started to publish science fiction . In its heyday , Gnome published many of the major SF authors , and in some cases , as with Robert E. Howard 's Conan series ( published in six books from 1950 – 1955 ) and Isaac Asimov 's Foundation series ( published in three books from 1951 – 1953 ) , was responsible for the manner in which their stories were collected into book form .

The sense of movement along the rupture was almost pure strike-slip , with no vertical displacement seen . During the 1979 Imperial Valley earthquake the same section of the fault ruptured on the US side of the border , but this time there was no sign of rupture on the Mexican side . The displacement pattern of the two earthquakes was very similar on the US side , suggesting that the Imperial Fault slips in discrete patches .

		GOLD_MENTION=Kent State shootings
		CONTEXT=At this time in history , the nation was experiencing great turmoil within its boundaries due to the prolonged Vietnam War and the government 's cover-up of vital information about the true progress of the war . Construction for the New South began in 1968 , the year when public opinion of the war took a big turn for the worse . Just a few months before the gala open house for the new building the Kent State shootings occurred – four students were killed by National Guardsmen during a protest of the war and of government policy , sparking a new round of student protest across the nation . From the outside , South looks like a brick fortress . The new building was possibly made to counter the student unrest of the times . Windows are absent from the original building . Windows are prone to shatter easily unless expensive shatterproof glass is used . Structures of this time period tend to lack windows , which could be quickly destroyed by any violent protest around them , a common occurrence , making them at best expensive to replace and at worst a public safety hazard . The original floor plans also changed with more additions , such as the third floor , added in the late nineties with the seeming innovation of windows . NOTE : this is not confirmed by any architectural or other proposals or plans . In fact , the architectural design reflects the designwork done on countless office buildings at the time . However , students at South High were given an equally plausible alternative explanation for the somewhat prison-like structure . The architect for the New South Project was from Texas , and his interpretation for energy efficiency over the long winters caused him to eschew any extensive use of windows . Additionally , when the building first opened , it was an " Open School , " with no individual classrooms on the second floor . The small windows used in the design provided light across the open area . Only when the school was converted to typical classroom divisions did the lack of natural light become an issue . NOTE : according to the architectural plans , the building was designed to meet the needs of the modular programming . This required an open resource area , lined by resource rooms . When the district decided modular programming was not working , the walls were constructed to return the school to a more traditional setting . It was at this point that the lack of windows became a problem and the " maze " was necessary in order to meet classroom size and number requirements . The original plans accommodated 1500 students , but South 's enrollment has held steady at 2,000 . The building is still short at least 7 classrooms , despite the internal remodel to meet growing needs . The original floor plan was open , in keeping with the educational philosophies of the time . Ideally , such a configuration would allow for shared learning among students in different classes . But the open floor plan produced distractions and additional interior walls were added later to separate different classrooms from one another . The construction of classrooms after the fact created a " rabbit maze " of identical hallways , and in some instances classrooms that are only accessible via other classrooms

The new military subsequently underwent changes as the new Meiji government became more organized , while adapting national policy with available resources . During the 1870s , failed in engage in significant expansion . This was due in part to the domestic turmoil such as peasant and samurai uprisings faced by the nascent Meiji government and financial difficulties , as acquiring a large navy was an expensive proposition . Consequently , the IJN concentrated on developing its officer corps and the training of its personnel . However , in the early 1880s , in the aftermath of the Imo Incident in 1882 and with internal threats to its security eliminated , the Meiji government undertook the first significant naval expansion in Japan 's history . The IJN developed plans for the expansion of the fleet to forty - two vessels , thirty - two of which would have to be newly constructed . Between 1882 and 1884 , twelve new vessels were purchased or put under construction . Spurred on by anxieties over China , Japanese military expenditures grew steadily in the 1880s . In 1880 the share of military spending had amounted to 19 percent of total government expenditures , in 1886 it had risen to 25 percent and by 1890 it stood at 31 percent .

The new military subsequently underwent changes as the new Meiji government became more organized , while adapting national policy with available resources . During the 1870s , failed in engage in significant expansion . This was due in part to the domestic turmoil such as peasant and samurai uprisings faced by the nascent Meiji government and financial difficulties , as acquiring a large navy was an expensive proposition . Consequently , the IJN concentrated on developing its officer corps and the training of its personnel . However , in the early 1880s , in the aftermath of the Imo Incident in 1882 and with internal threats to its security eliminated , the Meiji government undertook the first significant naval expansion in Japan 's history . The IJN developed plans for the expansion of the fleet to forty - two vessels , thirty - two of which would have to be newly constructed . Between 1882 and 1884 , twelve new vessels were purchased or put under construction . Spurred on by anxieties over China , Japanese military expenditures grew steadily in the 1880s . In 1880 the share of military spending had amounted to 19 percent of total government expenditures , in 1886 it had risen to 25 percent and by 1890 it stood at 31 percent .

		GOLD_MENTION=second shooting down
		CONTEXT=The second shooting down , on 12 February 1979 , killed all 59 on board . The real target of the second attack was General Peter Walls , head of the COMOPS ( Commander , Combined Operations ) , in charge of the Special Forces , including the SAS and the Selous Scouts . Due to the large number of tourists returning to Salisbury a second flight had been dispatched . General Walls received a boarding card for the second flight , which departed Kariba 15 minutes after the doomed aircraft . No one has been brought to trial or charged with shooting down the aircraft due to amnesty laws passed by both Smith and Mugabe . In a television interview not long after the attack on the first aircraft , Nkomo joked about the incident while admitting ZAPU had indeed been responsible . In his memoirs , '' Story of My Life '' , published in 1985 , Nkomo later said , " during that interview , the interviewee had asked about what we used to down the planes and I said stones , jokingly in an attempt to avoid answering the question due to military intelligence which demanded secrecy regarding what type of weapons we had acquired from the Soviet Union . They remembered the laugh and not the regret for the shooting down of both aircraft . " Nkomo founded the National Democratic Party ( NDP ) and in 1960 , the year British prime minister Harold Macmillan spoke of the " Wind of Change " blowing through Africa , Robert Mugabe joined him . The NDP was banned by the white minority government and it was subsequently replaced by the Zimbabwe African Peoples Union ( ZAPU ) , also founded by Nkomo , in 1962 , itself immediately banned . ZAPU split in 1963 and while some have claimed this split was due to ethnic tensions , more accurately the split was motivated by the failure of Sithole , Mugabe , Takawira and Malianga to wrest control of ZAPU from Nkomo .

		CONTEXT=< ! -- Deleted image removed : On 3 September 1978 , Air Rhodesia Flight 825 , a Vickers Viscount with registration VP-WAS , was shot down near Kariba by nationalist guerrillas . Only eight people survived the crash and the ensuing massacre by the guerilla fighters . Just five months later , on 12 February 1979 , Air Rhodesia Flight 827 , another Viscount , registered VP-YND , was shot down in the same area , killing everyone on board . As a protective measure , all of the surviving Air Rhodesia Viscounts were quickly painted in a special yellowish-green , matt paint , and all shiny metal surfaces on the aircraft , including propeller blades and spinners , were painted over . In order to prevent heat-seeking missiles from locking on to the hot jet pipes , specially designed engine guards were fitted to the engine nacelles , which had the effect of significantly increasing the aircraft 's fuel consumption . Meanwhile , due to the ongoing war , passenger numbers continued to plummet as fuel prices soared

The war developed out of a breakdown in relations between the two countries after the president of North Yemen , Ahmad al - Ghashmi , was killed on 24 June 1978 and Salim Rubai Ali , a moderate Marxist who had been working on a proposed merger between the two Yemens , was murdered two days later .

North Yemen appeared on the edge of a decisive defeat after a three - front invasion by South Yemeni combined arms formation , however this was prevented by a successful mediation in the form of the Kuwait Agreement of 1979 , which resulted in Arab League forces being deployed to patrol the North - South border .

		GOLD_MENTION=S7 Airlines Flight 778
		CONTEXT=Rasputin 's daughter Maria died in the 2006 crash of S7 Airlines Flight 778 , and his wife died six years later . He died in Moscow on 14 March 2015 , a day short of his 78th birthday . Patriarch Kirill of the Russian Orthodox Church conducted his funeral service , and President Vladimir Putin paid his respects . ( In 2014 Rasputin had co-signed a letter by writers in support of Putin 's annexation of the Crimea . ) Rasputin is closely associated with a movement in post-war Soviet literature known as " village prose , " or sometimes " rural prose " ( деревенская проза ) . Beginning in the time of the Khrushchev Thaw ( оттепель ) , village prose was praised for its stylistic and thematic departures from socialist realism . Village prose works usually focused on the hardships of the Soviet peasantry , espoused an idealized picture of traditional village life , and implicitly or explicitly criticized official modernization projects . Rasputin 's 1979 novel '' Farewell to Matyora '' , which depicts a fictional Siberian village which is to be evacuated and cleared so that a hydroelectric dam can be constructed further down the Angara River , was considered the epitome of this genre . The opening paragraph below is a good example of Rasputin 's writing style ( exceptional even for the village prose writers ) , and the novel 's theme of natural cycles disrupted by modernization : '' Once more spring had come , one more in the never-ending cycle , but for Matyora this spring would be the last , the last for both the island and the village that bore the same name . Once more , rumbling passionately , the ice broke , piling up mounds on the banks , and the liberated Angara River opened up , stretching out into a mighty , sparkling flow . Once more the water gushed boisterously at the island ’s upper tip , before cascading down both channels of the riverbed ; once more greenery flared on the ground and in the greens , the first rains soaked the earth , the swifts and swallows flew back , and at dusk in the bogs the awakened frogs croaked their love of life . It had all happened many times before . '' ( From Rasputin 's novel '' Farewell to Matyora '' , translated by Antonina W. Bouis , 1979 ) Rasputin 's nonfiction works contain similar themes , often in support of relevant political causes . He directed particularly trenchant criticism at large-scale dam building , like the project that flooded his own hometown , and water management projects , like the diversion of the Siberian rivers to Central Asia . He argued that these projects were destructive not simply in an ecological sense , but in a moral sense as well

		CONTEXT=Trnopolje was described variously as a ghetto , a prison and a detention camp . A United Nations ( UN ) report from 1994 reported that Trnopolje was a concentration camp which functioned as a staging area for mass deportations mainly of women , children , and elderly men . The reported found that : Refugees reported that Trnopolje was a " decent " camp in comparison to Omarska and Keraterm as there were no systematic killings , only arbitrary ones . Indeed , many non-Serbs entered the camp voluntarily , " simply to avoid the rampaging militias plundering their streets and villages " . This phenomenon led British journalist Ed Vulliamy to describe Trnopolje as " a perverse haven " for the Bosniaks and Croats of Prijedor . Author Hariz Halilovich writes : Many inmates were starved and physically or verbally abused during their imprisonment . By August 1992 , Trnopolje held about 3,500 people . On 7 August 1992 , reporters from Independent Television News ( ITN ) , a British television station , took footage of the prisoners at Omarska and Trnopolje , and recorded their living conditions . The images were shown around the world and caused public outrage . This prompted the Bosnian Serb authorities to allow journalists and the International Red Cross ( IRC ) access to some of the Prijedor camps , but not before the most emaciated of the prisoners were killed or shipped off to camps far from the public eye . Some 200 former male inmates were separated and killed in the Korićani Cliffs massacre on 21 August 1992 . The publicity generated by the discovery of the Prijedor camps led to their closure by the end of August . In mid-August , Trnopolje was placed into the hands of the IRC . The camp was officially shut down that November

It was credited with the liberation of the town of Novozybkov on September 25 , 1943 . After battling its way through eastern Belarus during the autumn and winter of 1943 – 44 , and then helping complete its liberation during Operation Bagration , it was moved to East Prussia , where it took part in the Battle of Königsberg in the spring of 1945 , ending the war on the Baltic coast near the Zemland Peninsula . In the course of these campaigns the 307th compiled a battle record to rival a Guards unit ( which it narrowly missed out on ) but was nevertheless disbanded on the second - last day of 1945 .

		CONTEXT=An episode of '' MTV Unplugged '' starring Cyrus premiered through MTV on January 29 , 2014 ; she performed an acoustic version of " Wrecking Ball " , among several additional tracks from '' Bangerz '' . On May 27 , 2014 Cyrus performed the song during the World Music Awards held in Monte Carlo , Monaco ; where she also won four World Music Awards . She wore a gown with a scenic theme based on flowers during the performance . It received positive reviews for its understated simplicity and strong vocal delivery . Cyrus returned to perform the song during the musical festival on June 21 , 2014 , Summertime Ball at Wembley Stadium of London , in front of 80,000 people . Cyrus has performed the song during her ongoing Bangerz Tour . A critic from the '' Nashville Scene '' praised the performance , writing , " Wrecking Ball was sung by Miley and earnestly shouted in unison by the arena , some of the audience tearing up . " Blake Hannon praised Cyrus ' vocal delivery , writing , " The crowd kept going when things slowed down for Wrecking Ball . It was the highlight of the night , and not because of anything visual . The costumed characters vanished and the screen was black , with Cyrus belting out one of the best pop power ballads in recent memory with only a smattering of lights . It 's a reminder that beneath it all , Cyrus has a voice — and a pretty big one , at that . " In September 2013 , British singer-songwriter James Arthur covered " Wrecking Ball " on Radio Hamburg in Germany . Later that month , The Gregory Brothers released a country version , which Laura Vitto from Mashable felt " trades in Miley 's pop-ballad sound for a twangier feel . " American singer-songwriter Alonzo Holt released his own rendition in October , which featured vocals from Arthur ; it peaked at number 97 on the UK Singles Chart and number 71 on the Irish Singles Chart . Upstate New York alternative metal band Cry To The Blind released a cover of " Wrecking Ball " on December 11 , 2013 . American group Haim covered " Wrecking Ball " during their performance on BBC Radio 1 's Live Lounge , while the trio London Grammar sang it for the same session in December . Rumer Willis later sang the track during a performance which Chiderah Monde from '' Daily News '' felt " captured more of the emotion behind the song " than Cyrus ' version . American singer Rebecca Black uploaded an acoustic version to her YouTube channel in November . Canadian singer Sarah Blackwood of Walk Off the Earth also released an acoustic version

" Addressing a pro-Israel rally in Stockholm , Sweden , on 31 August 2014 , Singer declared : “ Israel and its actions in Gaza are used as an excuse to besiege a synagogue in Paris , to shout ‘ Jews to the gas ’ on the streets of Berlin , or to attack people wearing a Jewish skullcap . None of this is acceptable , and it is high time that European leaders stand up against these expressions of antisemitism and take action . ” In September 2014 , it was announced that the World Jewish Congress would play a leading role in preparing the commemorative events in Auschwitz marking the 70th anniversary of the liberation of the notorious Nazi death camp , in January 2015 . In a press release , Singer said : " This will probably mark the last time that so many survivors will be able to join us at Auschwitz , and we must ensure that the unspeakable suffering they and many others had to endure at Auschwitz will not be forgotten once they are no longer among us . " Following the 2015 Copenhagen shootings , Singer traveled to Norway , Denmark , and Finland where he met with the leadership of Jewish communities as well as senior government officials

		CONTEXT=The dangers to journalists in Russia have been well known since the early 1990s but concern over the number of unsolved killings soared after Anna Politkovskaya 's murder in Moscow on 7 October 2006 . While international monitors mentioned a dozen deaths , some sources within Russia talked of over two hundred fatalities . The evidence has since been examined and documented in two reports , published in Russian and English , by international organizations . These revealed a basic confusion in terminology that explained the seemingly enormous numerical discrepancy : statistics of premature death among journalists ( from work accidents , crossfire incidents , and purely criminal or domestic cases of manslaughter ) were repeatedly equated with the much smaller number of targeted ( contract ) killings or work - related murders . The Remembrance Day of Journalists Killed in the Line of Duty in Russia is observed on 15 December every year .

		GOLD_MENTION=S7 Airlines Flight 778
		CONTEXT=Rasputin 's daughter Maria died in the 2006 crash of S7 Airlines Flight 778 , and his wife died six years later . He died in Moscow on 14 March 2015 , a day short of his 78th birthday . Patriarch Kirill of the Russian Orthodox Church conducted his funeral service , and President Vladimir Putin paid his respects . ( In 2014 Rasputin had co-signed a letter by writers in support of Putin 's annexation of the Crimea . ) Rasputin is closely associated with a movement in post-war Soviet literature known as " village prose , " or sometimes " rural prose " ( деревенская проза ) . Beginning in the time of the Khrushchev Thaw ( оттепель ) , village prose was praised for its stylistic and thematic departures from socialist realism . Village prose works usually focused on the hardships of the Soviet peasantry , espoused an idealized picture of traditional village life , and implicitly or explicitly criticized official modernization projects . Rasputin 's 1979 novel '' Farewell to Matyora '' , which depicts a fictional Siberian village which is to be evacuated and cleared so that a hydroelectric dam can be constructed further down the Angara River , was considered the epitome of this genre . The opening paragraph below is a good example of Rasputin 's writing style ( exceptional even for the village prose writers ) , and the novel 's theme of natural cycles disrupted by modernization : '' Once more spring had come , one more in the never-ending cycle , but for Matyora this spring would be the last , the last for both the island and the village that bore the same name . Once more , rumbling passionately , the ice broke , piling up mounds on the banks , and the liberated Angara River opened up , stretching out into a mighty , sparkling flow . Once more the water gushed boisterously at the island ’s upper tip , before cascading down both channels of the riverbed ; once more greenery flared on the ground and in the greens , the first rains soaked the earth , the swifts and swallows flew back , and at dusk in the bogs the awakened frogs croaked their love of life .

Bouis , 1979 ) Rasputin 's nonfiction works contain similar themes , often in support of relevant political causes . He directed particularly trenchant criticism at large-scale dam building , like the project that flooded his own hometown , and water management projects , like the diversion of the Siberian rivers to Central Asia . He argued that these projects were destructive not simply in an ecological sense , but in a moral sense as well

In 1937 , her letters to her lover , Italian General , airship pioneer and Arctic explorer Umberto Nobile , indicated that she was in Frankfurt for an extended period , and then in 1938 , she spent time in Basel and Geneva before returning to Frankfurt . Hitler 's first meeting with Mussolini took place in Rome in May 1938 , but Speier was not back in Rome until July . Then in September , she was in the Tuscan town of Chianciano Terme . Pope Pius XI died on 10 February , 1939 and Speier converted to Catholicism later that year with Pope Pius XII immediately renewing her employment . Although she was intensely occupied with her work at the Vatican , she often considered emigrating to the United States , where her mother and sister lived , or to Brazil . During this early period of his papacy , Pius XII granted 3,000 visas to Jews , if they had been baptized , to emigrate to Brazil , though the only evidence found linking Speier and Pius XII at this time was , in her correspondence , his congratulatory telegram on her conversion . Throughout 1939 and 1940 , Nobile was in the United States and Speier remained in Rome until the summer of 1940 , when she took a retreat to Chianciano . After 1940 , correspondence between the two was sparse as they feared censors and writing had become increasingly impractical . Nobile returned to Rome in May 1942 and her family severed communication with Speier after learning of her Catholic baptism , effectively ending her reasons for emigration . During the German occupation of Rome 1943/1944 Pope Pius XII made arrangements for Giulio Belvederi , nephew of the former Pontifical Master of Ceremonies Pietro Respighi , to hide Speier in the Catacombs of St. Priscilla , under the nunnery . Hiding in the catacombs saved Speier from the Raid of the Ghetto of Rome on 16 October 1943 in which more than 1,000 Jews were deported to Auschwitz and all save 16 were killed . During this part of the war , the Museum was closed , until the end of September 1944 , and many artworks from war-torn areas were shipped to the Vatican for storage . When it reopened , she continued with her work creating a detailed monuments inventory of the Vatican holdings , which resulted in several important finds . In 1946 , in an antiquities storage facility , she found a horse head sculpted by Phidias which was originally from one of the pediments of the Parthenon . On further examination , it was established from its weathering that it was in fact the second horse of Athena 's chariot on the western gable , where the dispute between Athena and Poseidon over the land of Attica is depicted . Speier also discovered the two so-called ancient Aurai statues that decorated the exterior of the Sala Rotonda when it was built in the 18th century . She published '' Die Skulpturen des Vaticanischen Museums '' ( The Sculptures of the Vatican Museums ) in 1956 about the find of the Parthenon horse 's head , and earlier in 1950 had published a distinguished report concerning the excavations of St. Peter 's Basilica in Herbig 's '' Vermächtnis der Antiken Kunst '' ( Legacy of Ancient Art ) entitled " Die neuen Ausgrabungen unter der Peterskirche in Rom "

		CONTEXT=Greenbelt is a city in Prince George 's County , Maryland , United States , and a suburb of Washington , D.C. Greenbelt is notable for being the first and the largest of the three experimental and controversial New Deal Greenbelt Towns : Greenhills , Ohio and Greendale , Wisconsin being the others . Thus , it was planned and built by the Federal government . The cooperative community was conceived in 1935 by Undersecretary of Agriculture Rexford Guy Tugwell , whose perceived collectivist ideology attracted opposition to the Greenbelt Towns project throughout its short duration . The project came into legal existence in the spring of 1935 . On April 8 , 1935 , Congress passed the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935 . Under the authority granted to him by this legislation , President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued an executive order , on May 1 , 1935 , establishing the United States Resettlement Administration ( RA / RRA ) .

		CONTEXT=The pattern of displacement along the Imperial Fault was very similar to that observed for the northern part of the rupture during the 1940 El Centro earthquake , although on this occasion the rupture did not extend across the border into Mexico . This had been explained as the behavior of individual slip patches along the Imperial Fault with two patches rupturing in 1940 and only the northern one in 1979 . The faulting that gave rise to the earthquake has been modeled by comparing synthetic seismograms with near-source strong motion recordings . This analysis showed that the rupture speed had at times exceeded the shear wave velocity , making this the first earthquake for which supershear rupture was inferred

It was an open two - seater with an aluminium body on a steel chassis . The bodywork was originally made by Kühn . From 1936 the chassis was made more suitable for off road driving with shortened frame and more robust details . Autenrieth in Darmstadt made the bodywork for those . The engine was originally the same as the standard cars while the mk2 got the 2.5 litre six cylinder engine from the Super Six . From 1938 Opel also used the larger engine from the Kapitän . The reason for building the Geländesportwagen may have been that car trials were popular , but also that Germany was secretly training for war .

" A picture of al-Quso surfaced with a Yemeni journalist Arafat Mudabish , who interviewed him for a story .

Al-Quso was from the same tribe as radical U.S.-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki , who had an operational role in the attack . On December 7 , 2010 the United States Department of State designated al-Quso as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist under Executive Order 13224 which “ blocks all al-Quso ’s property interests subject to U.S. jurisdiction and prohibits U.S. persons from engaging in transactions for the benefit of al-Quso . ” “ He was also placed on the United Nations ( UN ) 1267 list of persons associated with al Qa’ida and the Taliban requiring all UN member states to implement an assets freeze , a travel ban , and an arms embargo against this individual . ” Fahd Mohammed Ahmed al-Quso was killed by a CIA drone 's missile in Yemen on May 6 , 2012 , as he exited a vehicle alongside another operative .

		GOLD_MENTION=S7 Airlines Flight 778
		CONTEXT=Rasputin 's daughter Maria died in the 2006 crash of S7 Airlines Flight 778 , and his wife died six years later . He died in Moscow on 14 March 2015 , a day short of his 78th birthday . Patriarch Kirill of the Russian Orthodox Church conducted his funeral service , and President Vladimir Putin paid his respects . ( In 2014 Rasputin had co-signed a letter by writers in support of Putin 's annexation of the Crimea . ) Rasputin is closely associated with a movement in post-war Soviet literature known as " village prose , " or sometimes " rural prose " ( деревенская проза ) . Beginning in the time of the Khrushchev Thaw ( оттепель ) , village prose was praised for its stylistic and thematic departures from socialist realism . Village prose works usually focused on the hardships of the Soviet peasantry , espoused an idealized picture of traditional village life , and implicitly or explicitly criticized official modernization projects . Rasputin 's 1979 novel '' Farewell to Matyora '' , which depicts a fictional Siberian village which is to be evacuated and cleared so that a hydroelectric dam can be constructed further down the Angara River , was considered the epitome of this genre . The opening paragraph below is a good example of Rasputin 's writing style ( exceptional even for the village prose writers ) , and the novel 's theme of natural cycles disrupted by modernization : '' Once more spring had come , one more in the never-ending cycle , but for Matyora this spring would be the last , the last for both the island and the village that bore the same name . Once more , rumbling passionately , the ice broke , piling up mounds on the banks , and the liberated Angara River opened up , stretching out into a mighty , sparkling flow . Once more the water gushed boisterously at the island ’s upper tip , before cascading down both channels of the riverbed ; once more greenery flared on the ground and in the greens , the first rains soaked the earth , the swifts and swallows flew back , and at dusk in the bogs the awakened frogs croaked their love of life . It had all happened many times before . '' ( From Rasputin 's novel '' Farewell to Matyora '' , translated by Antonina W. Bouis , 1979 ) Rasputin 's nonfiction works contain similar themes , often in support of relevant political causes . He directed particularly trenchant criticism at large-scale dam building , like the project that flooded his own hometown , and water management projects , like the diversion of the Siberian rivers to Central Asia . He argued that these projects were destructive not simply in an ecological sense , but in a moral sense as well

		CONTEXT=For a period during 2008-2009 the Assyrian Finance minister went missing . Many people believed that he was kidnapped or the victim of assassination .

		GOLD_MENTION=S7 Airlines Flight 778
		CONTEXT=Rasputin 's daughter Maria died in the 2006 crash of S7 Airlines Flight 778 , and his wife died six years later . He died in Moscow on 14 March 2015 , a day short of his 78th birthday . Patriarch Kirill of the Russian Orthodox Church conducted his funeral service , and President Vladimir Putin paid his respects . ( In 2014 Rasputin had co-signed a letter by writers in support of Putin 's annexation of the Crimea . ) Rasputin is closely associated with a movement in post-war Soviet literature known as " village prose , " or sometimes " rural prose " ( деревенская проза ) . Beginning in the time of the Khrushchev Thaw ( оттепель ) , village prose was praised for its stylistic and thematic departures from socialist realism . Village prose works usually focused on the hardships of the Soviet peasantry , espoused an idealized picture of traditional village life , and implicitly or explicitly criticized official modernization projects . Rasputin 's 1979 novel '' Farewell to Matyora '' , which depicts a fictional Siberian village which is to be evacuated and cleared so that a hydroelectric dam can be constructed further down the Angara River , was considered the epitome of this genre . The opening paragraph below is a good example of Rasputin 's writing style ( exceptional even for the village prose writers ) , and the novel 's theme of natural cycles disrupted by modernization : '' Once more spring had come , one more in the never-ending cycle , but for Matyora this spring would be the last , the last for both the island and the village that bore the same name . Once more , rumbling passionately , the ice broke , piling up mounds on the banks , and the liberated Angara River opened up , stretching out into a mighty , sparkling flow . Once more the water gushed boisterously at the island ’s upper tip , before cascading down both channels of the riverbed ; once more greenery flared on the ground and in the greens , the first rains soaked the earth , the swifts and swallows flew back , and at dusk in the bogs the awakened frogs croaked their love of life . It had all happened many times before . '' ( From Rasputin 's novel '' Farewell to Matyora '' , translated by Antonina W. Bouis , 1979 ) Rasputin 's nonfiction works contain similar themes , often in support of relevant political causes . He directed particularly trenchant criticism at large-scale dam building , like the project that flooded his own hometown , and water management projects , like the diversion of the Siberian rivers to Central Asia . He argued that these projects were destructive not simply in an ecological sense , but in a moral sense as well

		GOLD_MENTION=2006 Moscow market bombing
		CONTEXT=The wars in Chechnya , and the associated Caucasian terrorism in Russia , were a major factor in the growth of intolerance , xenophobia , and racist violence in Russia , directed in a great part against the people from Caucasus . The Russian authorities were unlikely to label random attacks on people of non-Russian ethnicity as racist , preferring calling it " hooliganism " . The number of murders officially classified as racist more than doubled in Russia between 2003 and 2004 . The violence included acts of terrorism such as the 2006 Moscow market bombing which killed 13 people . In 2007 , 18-year-old Artur Ryno claimed responsibility for 37 racially motivated murders in the course of one year , saying that " since school he hated people from the Caucasus . " On 5 June 2007 , an anti-Chechen riot involving hundreds of people took place in the town of Stavropol in southern Russia . Rioters demanded the eviction of ethnic Chechens following the murder of two young Russians who locals believed were killed by Chechens . The event revived memories of a recent clash between Chechens and local Russians in Kondopoga over an unpaid bill , when two Russians were killed . The Caucasians also face ethnic-related violence in the ranks of Russian Army

I think it 's good for me to take a break and reassess why I 'm doing it and how I 'm doing it . And I think this is probably a good way to learn about that . " Gosling 's directorial debut '' Lost River '' competed in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival . The " fantasy noir " , written by Gosling , stars Christina Hendricks , Ben Mendelsohn , and Matt Smith . The film received largely unfavorable reviews . Peter Bradshaw of '' The Guardian '' found it " insufferably conceited " and remarked that Gosling had lost " any sense of proportion or humility . " Robbie Collin of '' The Telegraph '' described '' Lost River '' as " mind-bogglingly pleased with itself " , while '' Variety '' s Justin Chang dismissed the " derivative " film as a " train-wreck . " In 2015 , he played a bond salesman in the ensemble financial satire '' The Big Short '' , a Best Picture nominee at the 2016 Academy Awards .

" Peter Travers of '' Rolling Stone '' said : " Gosling , a virtuoso of verbal sleaze , talks directly to the camera , and he 's volcanically fierce and funny . " The following year , Gosling starred in the black comedy '' The Nice Guys '' , opposite Russell Crowe , and in Damien Chazelle 's musical '' La La Land '' , for which he won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and received his second Academy Award for Best Actor nomination . Robbie Collins took note of his chemistry with co-star Emma Stone and wrote , " Both stars are so attuned to each other ’s pace and flow that their repartee just seems to tumble out , perfectly formed . " It emerged as one of his most commercially successful films , with earnings of over $ 440 million against its $ 30 million budget
