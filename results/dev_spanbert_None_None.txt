By February 23 , 2018 , the track " This Is Me " was nominated for Best Original Song at the 2018 Academy Awards . According to Sky News on March 25 , 2018 , " music critics have put the album 's success down to the feel-good , uplifting pop tunes which are also old school at the same time . " Sheila O'Malley of RogerEbert.com called the 11 songs " memorable , " praising the vocal performances of the leads . The women 's magazine '' Bustle '' gave it a positive review , particularly certain vocal performances . '' Stereogum '' described the soundtrack music as eclectic in its influences , giving it a negative reception for " serving up earnest buoyancy in many high-fructose flavors . " Also noting the eclectic mix of musical genres , '' The Ringer '' writes that " the bombastic tunes mix EDM gleams with stadium-rock grunts , chest-pounding ballads with peppy empowerment anthems , a thoroughly modern and disconcertingly eager post-genre assault designed to barnstorm as many Spotify playlists as possible . It 's a gilded cheese ball , pushing exhilaration to the point of exhaustion . " '' The Guardian '' wrote that the album brought " a whole lot of self-empowerment , enlivened with some deracinated R&B beats , and given the necessary gravitas by some power ballads of the sort that make one imagine the singer filmed from below with a wind machine blowing in their face . " Keala Settle performed " This Is Me " live on '' The Graham Norton Show '' on February 9 , 2018 . Later she performed on '' The Ellen DeGeneres Show '' on February 21 , 2018 .

                CONTEXT=" Adam 's Song " is generally considered one of the band 's more serious songs , one " that hints at the emotional maturity they 'd show on later releases , " particularly their eponymous 2003 release . Richard Harrington of '' The Washington Post '' deemed the song " a powerful exploration of exhaustion and depression . " Alex Pappademas , writing for '' Spin '' , compared the song to the music of Weezer . Katy Kroll of '' Billboard '' recognized it among her top 10 singles of 2000 , calling it " a good old-fashioned depressing song with mainstream flair . " Geoff Boucher , writing for the '' Los Angeles Times '' , called it " a poignant essay on a teen mulling over suicide " ; conversely , Steve Appleford of the '' Los Angeles Times '' dubbed it a " moving if unremarkable examination . " Scott Mervis of the '' Pittsburgh Post-Gazette '' called it a " rare departure from the usual Blink fare . " Writers for '' The A.V. Club '' listed it among other suicide-related songs in 2009 , describing it as " surprisingly affecting , especially when the band reaches the bombastic chorus , and when the song describes suicide 's crushing aftermath . " In a retrospective review , Chris Payne of '' Billboard '' wrote , " Stylistically , it 's also a Blink breakthrough : rather than putting their heads down and plowing through at breakneck speed , the band dials back the verses and interludes to let them breathe a bit . The resulting chorus achieves an arena-worthy feel not achieved anywhere else on '' Enema of the State '' . " The song caused a controversy in 2000 when it was set to replay indefinitely on a nearby stereo as 17-year-old Greg Barnes , a teenager who attended Columbine High School and had lost one of his best friends in the massacre the previous year , hanged himself in the garage of his family 's home . Both Hoppus and DeLonge were sympathetic but stressed the song 's meaning during an MTV News interview in 2001 : Hoppus also told interviewers that he received fan mail following the song 's release from fans that had contemplated suicide , but decided not to go through with it after hearing the song . '' Rolling Stone '' compared the controversy to that of Ozzy Osbourne 's " Suicide Solution " , which similarly was playing as a teen committed suicide

                CONTEXT=The Immaculate Reception is one of the most famous plays in the history of American football . It occurred in the AFC divisional playoff game of the National Football League ( NFL ) , between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Oakland Raiders at Three Rivers Stadium in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , on December 23 , 1972 . With the Steelers trailing in the last 30 seconds of the game , Pittsburgh quarterback Terry Bradshaw threw a pass attempt to John Fuqua . The ball either bounced off the helmet of Raiders safety Jack Tatum or off the hands of Fuqua , and , as it fell , Steelers fullback Franco Harris scooped it up and ran for a game - winning touchdown . The play has been a source of unresolved controversy and speculation ever since , as many people have contended that the ball only touched Fuqua or that it hit the ground before Harris caught it , either of which would have resulted in an incomplete pass by the rules at the time . Kevin Cook 's The Last Headbangers cites the play as the beginning of a bitter rivalry between Pittsburgh and Oakland that fueled a historically brutal Raiders team during the NFL 's most controversially physical era .

                CONTEXT=" To this fear were added specific programs to tax property so as to create public improvements and jobs to benefit working class voters . The observation of Lord Bryce that municipal government was ' The conspicuous failure of the United States ' was often quoted . The import of such projections was not lost on middle-class families , who often took the opportunity that low price and good transportation afforded to move beyond city jurisdictions . " " Throughout the nineteenth century ... American cities annexed adjacent land and grew steadily ... the predominant view in the nineteenth century was the doctrine of forcible annexation . " However that would change toward the end of the century : " the first really significant defeat for the consolidation movement came when Brookline spurned Boston in 1874 . Thereafter virtually every other Eastern and Middle Western city was rebuffed by wealthy and independent suburbs . " By the turn of the 19th century , a middle class expectation of having residential space had emerged , which Jackson attributes to work of Andrew Jackson Downing , Calvert Vaux , and Catharine Beecher . “ Family came to be a personal bastion against society , a place of refuge , free from outside control , ” with “ the emerging values of domesticity , privacy , and isolation reach ing fullest development in the United States . The big , mean city , with its confidence men and squalor , did not promise the same haven as the suburbs . The “ ideal house came to be viewed as resting in the middle of a manicured lawn or picturesque garden . ” In 1833 in newly rebuilt Chicago , a new type of building appeared , ' balloon frame , ' that " would absorb most of the population growth of the United States over the next one hundred and fifty years " . A " new structure could be erected more quickly by two men than the European-style heavy timber frame by twenty ... so that many poorly paid immigrant groups had homeownership rates as high as white Americans . " " For the first time in the history of the world , middle class families in the late nineteenth century could reasonably expect to buy a detached home on an accessible lot ... the real price of shelter in the United States was lower than in the Old World . " Intended to spur housing construction after the Great Depression , President Roosevelt 's Federal Housing Administration established minimum standards for home construction and low down-payment amounts , and home loans amortized for the full-term of 20 to 30 years . Before that , " first mortgages were limited to one-of or two-thirds of the appraised value of the property " , and loans had to be renewed every five years and interest rates were subject to revision every renewal

                CONTEXT=Living Stage Theatre Company was a theatre for social change founded in 1966 by Robert A. Alexander ( 1929 – 2008 ) . He served as the artistic director until 1995 . Located in Washington , D.C. , this professional improvisational theater offered participatory workshops to children , youth , teachers , parents , and community members . Living Stage ’s main philosophy was based in the belief that every one is born an artist and the act of creation is the ultimate act of self - affirmation . The company 's mission was to transform individuals and communities through creative empowerment . The projects that the Living Stage put on typically dealt with controversial and sensitive topics like race , economic inequality , the dangers of an overzealous American foreign policy , the atom bomb , violence , and freedom . The " Baltimore Incident " of 1971 is an excellent example of how controversial these productions could be . No matter how mixed opinions were , the Living Stage always elicited a reaction with their improvisational performances . During the 1980s the Living Stage began to reach out extensively to local initiatives like The District 's Alcohol and Drug Abuse Services Administration and created their own Community Services Project in order to continue to bring theater and creativity to underserved sections of society . The Living Stage championed New Left ideals like equality and social justice throughout the Reagan years , despite some criticisms about their message being " anachronistic " . The Living Stage dissolved after 36 years and was a venture of Arena Stage .

                CONTEXT=Betrayal is the secondary theme of '' The Wild Bunch '' . The characters suffer from their knowledge of having betrayed a friend and left him to his fate , thus violating their own honor code when it suits them ( " $ 10,000 cuts an awful lot of family ties " ) . However , Bishop says , " When you side with a man , you stay with him , and if you ca n't do that you 're like some animal . " Such oppositional ideas lead to the film 's violent conclusion , as the remaining men find their abandonment of Angel intolerable . Bishop remembers his betrayals , most notably when he deserts Deke Thornton ( in flashback ) when the law catches up to them and when he abandons Crazy Lee at the railroad office after the robbery ( ostensibly to guard the hostages ) . Critic David Weddle writes that , " like that of Conrad 's '' Lord Jim '' , Pike Bishop 's heroism is propelled by overwhelming guilt and a despairing death wish . " Vincent Canby began his review by calling the film " very beautiful and the first truly interesting American-made Western in years . It 's also so full of violence — of an intensity that can hardly be supported by the story — that it 's going to prompt a lot of people who do not know the real effect of movie violence ( as I do not ) to write automatic condemnations of it . " He observed , " Although the movie 's conventional and poetic action sequences are extraordinarily good and its landscapes beautifully photographed ... it is most interesting in its almost jolly account of chaos , corruption , and defeat " . About the actors , he commented particularly on William Holden : " After years of giving bored performances in boring movies , Holden comes back gallantly in '' The Wild Bunch '' . He looks older and tired , but he has style , both as a man and as a movie character who persists in doing what he 's always done , not because he really wants the money but because there 's simply nothing else to do . " '' TIME '' also liked Holden 's performance , describing it as his best since '' Stalag 17 '' ( a 1953 film that earned Holden an Oscar ) , noting Robert Ryan gave " the screen performance of his career " , and concluding that " '' The Wild Bunch '' contains faults and mistakes " ( such as flashbacks " introduced with surprising clumsiness " ) , but " its accomplishments are more than sufficient to confirm that Peckinpah , along with Stanley Kubrick and Arthur Penn , belongs with the best of the newer generation of American filmmakers . " In a 2002 retrospective Roger Ebert , who " saw the original version at the world premiere in 1969 , during the golden age of the junket , when Warner Bros. screened five of its new films in the Bahamas for 450 critics and reporters " , said that back then he had publicly declared the film a masterpiece during the junket 's press conference , prompted by comments from " a reporter from the '' Reader 's Digest '' who got up to ask ' Why was this film ever made ? ' " He compared the film to '' Pulp Fiction '' : " praised and condemned with equal vehemence . " " What '' Citizen Kane '' was to movie lovers in 1941 , '' The Wild Bunch '' was to cineastes in 1969 , " wrote film critic Michael Sragow , who added that Peckinpah had " produced an American movie that equals or surpasses the best of Kurosawa : the Gotterdammerung of Westerns "

                CONTEXT=After the commercial lackluster of her eighth studio album , '' Britney Jean '' ( 2013 ) , Spears started her Las Vegas residency show , Britney : Piece of Me , which attained commercial success . Later , in September 2014 , Spears posted a picture of herself in the studio , hinting that she was recording new music . In another interview , a month later , she revealed that she was working " very slowly , but progressively " on the album . In 2015 , she released the song " Pretty Girls " with Iggy Azalea , however the song was met with moderate impact and Spears headed back to the studio to record more songs , but did n't have plans to release a new album . In November 2015 , Spears teased on her Instagram account that she was working with songwriters Justin Tranter and Julia Michaels , by posting a picture of them looking " bemused " with the caption : " Working hard and hardly working ... new album ... wheeeee ! . " A month later , Tranter gave an interview for website NewNowNext about his work with Spears and commented : " Working with Britney is a fucking dream . She is so sweet , so inspiring and a master on the mic . Me and Julia had to leave the studio one day because our screams of excitement after every take she did were distracting the producers . " In late 2016 , during interviews to promote the album , Spears declared that she wanted to explore new things on the record , and that it was her " most hip-hop album , " explaining : " ... there are like two or three songs that go in the direction of more urban that I 've wanted to do for a long time now , and I just have n't really done that . " In May 2016 , in an exclusive interview for website '' Breathe Heavy '' , Tranter revealed : " Nobody ever talks about Britney as a writer and she ’s f " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " was written by Mattias Larsson , Robin Fredriksson , Julia Michaels , Justin Tranter and Sandy Chila , with production being done by Mattman & Robin . Mattman & Robin were also responsible for programming , drums , percussion , snaps , handclaps , synths , guitars , bass and kalimba , while Michaels and Jermaine Jackson provided background vocals . It was recorded at 158 Studios , Westlake Village , California , The Studio at the Palms , Las Vegas , Nevada , and at Wolf Cousins Studios , Stockholm , Sweden . " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is an electropop , and dance-pop song that lasts for three minutes and twenty-two seconds ( 3:22 ) . It features " subtle keyboards , a strummed guitar , " and " wobbly bass " in its instrumentation . For Brian Josephs of '' Spin '' , the song 's guitar slaps " recall her 2001 single ' I 'm a Slave 4 U. ' " Other critics also felt that the " strummed flamenco guitar " on the song is similar to those on Justin Timberlake 's " Like I Love You " . Bianca Gracie of '' Fuse '' opined that the song reminded her of " the glory days ( no pun intended ) of ' Circus ' and ' Femme Fatale ' . " Lyrically , " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is a flirty song about Spears " offer ing several reasons why her lover should come over and options , which can be seen in the lines " Nobody should be alone if they do n't have to be " and " I could get into that kissin ' and touchin ' / Or we could be good and do next to nothin ' . " Amy Roberts of '' Bustle '' noted that the lyrics are about hooking up , adding that they " celebrate the idea that casual relationships do n't need to be lacking respect or understanding . You do n't have to be in love with , or committing to , the person that you 're hooking up with , but that also does n't mean that you ca n't connect with them on a different level than just sex . In fact , Spears makes it clear that it 's kind of even cool if her hook-up does n't want to have sex . Her partner can draw the boundaries of where the massage she 's offering starts and ends , and if it remains as nothing more than a back rub then so be it – that 's totally cool . " For Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine , the song features " some dubious lyrics that seem to suggest masturbatory self-love " in the lines : " All I want is what you want/And all you want is me . " The chorus of the song features " a shouted gang " of backup singers , singing : " Whatever you want / whatever you need / I 'll do it ! . " Lewis Corner of Digital Spy called it " a thumping pop anthem , " praising " Britney 's seductive vocal delivery . " Gil Kaufman of '' Billboard '' named it a " fun , flirty " track . Bianca Gracie of '' Fuse '' described it as a " pulsating track that is a flirty booty call that is bound to own the dance floor . " Robbie Daw of Idolator found it to be " a traditional Spears-style chunk of dance-pop " and " arguably the best yet , with its thick whomping bass and that sparkling ' nobody should be alone if they do n't have to be ' breakdown . " Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine called it " impeccably produced downstairs music , " adding that it " is an irresistible slice of dance-pop , with an ebullient bassline and staccato acoustic guitar . " Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic declared that " some of the highlights on the album are the silliest songs , " citing " Do You Wan na Come Over " 's " overheated flamenco chorus " as an example . Maura Johnston of '' Boston Globe '' said the song was one of the album 's high points , noting that the song " is jolted to life by the slashed guitars that helped make ' Toxic ' a pop thrill . " John Murphy of musicOMH was positive while noting that the track " has a rush and urgency about it which marks it out as one of the album 's best songs . " Nolan Feeney of '' Entertainment Weekly '' also picked it as a highlight , praising the " acoustic guitars and gurgling bass lines that make for one freaky pop experiment . " Alex Macpherson of '' The Guardian '' wrote that the song " takes the party back to Britney 's heyday , " praising the inclusion of the flamenco guitar . For '' Los Angeles Times '' writer Mikael Wood , the song " restore s some of the sonic invention that once defined Spears ' biggest hits . " Nick Levine , writing for '' NME '' , echoed the same thought , writing : " The lusty strut of ‘ Do You Wan na Come Over ? ’ nods to her early-noughties Neptunes-produced hits . " In his Vice column , Robert Christgau selected " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " and " Clumsy " as his favorite tracks on the album . Amy Mackelden of '' Bustle '' elaborated about the track : With a strong '90s vibe , an upbeat tempo , and a surprising rhythm , " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " utilizes the best of Spears ' talents . ... " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " embraces the current trend for songs that are musically complicated , that layer up their beats and sound effects , and feature multiple voices and infectious shouting during their choruses . Much like Hailee Steinfeld and Gwen Stefani 's latest offerings , " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is melodic , has a fast tempo , and is instantly recognizable . And most importantly , it 's fun . On August 18 , 2016 , Spears added " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " , as well as " Make Me ... " , to the setlist of her Las Vegas residency show Britney : Piece of Me . Later , on September 1 , 2016 , a performance of the song was broadcast from Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas for Today . During the performance , she used " an outfit similar to her risqué costume from 2016 's VMAs , while her backup dancers stood out in brightly-colored tank tops and shorts , " as reported by '' Entertainment Weekly '' Ruth Kinane . The song was also included in Spears 's setlist for the iHeartRadio Music Festival on September 24 , 2016 . Spears also performed it at I Heart Radio Jingle Ball , Triple Show and B26 Pepsi Jingle Bash during December 2016 . Also performed it at Apple Music Festival which was held in United Kingdom

                CONTEXT=The '' All Eyes on Sharon Tate '' documentary was used to publicize the film . Its 14 minutes consisted of a number of scenes depicting Tate filming '' Eye of the Devil '' , dancing in nightclubs , and sightseeing around London , and also contained a brief interview with her . Asked about her acting ambitions , she replied , " I do n't fool myself . I ca n't see myself doing Shakespeare . " She spoke of her hopes of finding a niche in comedy , and in other interviews she expressed her desire to become " a light comedienne in the Carole Lombard style " . She discussed the type of contemporary actress she wanted to emulate and explained that there were two in particular that she was influenced by : Faye Dunaway and Catherine Deneuve . Of the latter , she said , " I 'd like to be an American Catherine Deneuve . She plays beautiful , sensitive , deep parts with a little bit of intelligence behind them . " Later in the year , '' Valley of the Dolls '' opened to almost uniformly negative reviews . Bosley Crowther wrote in '' The New York Times '' , " all a fairly respectful admirer of movies can do is laugh at it and turn away " . '' Newsweek '' said that the film " has no more sense of its own ludicrousness than a village idiot stumbling in manure " , but a later article read : " Astoundingly photogenic , infinitely curvaceous , Sharon Tate is one of the most smashing young things to hit Hollywood in a long time . " The three lead actresses were castigated in numerous publications , including '' The Saturday Review '' , which wrote , " Ten years ago ... Parkins , Duke , and Tate would more likely have been playing the hat check girls than movie-queens ; they are totally lacking in style , authority , or charm . " '' The Hollywood Reporter '' provided some positive comments , such as , " Sharon Tate emerges as the film 's most sympathetic character ... William H. Daniels ' photographic caress of her faultless face and enormous absorbent eyes is stunning . " Roger Ebert of the '' Chicago Sun-Times '' praised Tate as " a wonder to behold " , but after describing the dialogue in one scene as " the most offensive and appalling vulgarity ever thrown up by any civilization " , concluded that , " I will be unable to take her any more seriously as a sex symbol than Raquel Welch . " In late 1967 , Tate and Polanski returned to London and were frequent subjects of newspaper and magazine articles . Tate was depicted as being untraditional and modern , and was quoted as saying couples should live together before marrying . They were married in Chelsea , London , on January 20 , 1968 , with considerable publicity . Polanski was dressed in what the press described as " Edwardian finery " , while Tate was attired in a white minidress . The couple moved into Polanski 's mews house off Eaton Square in Belgravia , London . Photographer Peter Evans later described them as " the imperfect couple . They were the Douglas Fairbanks/Mary Pickford of our time ... Cool , nomadic , talented , and nicely shocking . " While Tate reportedly wanted a traditional marriage , Polanski remained somewhat promiscuous and described Tate 's attitude to his infidelity as " Sharon 's big hang-up " . He reminded Tate that she had promised that she would not try to change him . Tate accepted Polanski 's conditions , though she confided to friends that she hoped he would change . Peter Evans quoted Tate as saying , " We have a good arrangement . Roman lies to me and I pretend to believe him . " Polanski urged Tate to end her association with Martin Ransohoff , and Tate began to place less importance on her career until Polanski told her he wanted to be married to " a hippie , not a housewife . " The couple returned to Los Angeles and quickly became part of a social group that included some of the most successful young people in the film industry , including Warren Beatty , Jacqueline Bisset , Leslie Caron , Joan Collins , Mia Farrow , Jane Fonda , Peter Fonda , Laurence Harvey , Steve McQueen , Joanna Pettet and Peter Sellers ; older film stars like Yul Brynner , Kirk Douglas , Henry Fonda and Danny Kaye ; musicians such as Jim Morrison and The Mamas & the Papas ; and record producer Terry Melcher and his girlfriend , actress Candice Bergen . Jay Sebring remained one of the couple 's more frequent companions . Polanski 's circle of friends included people he had known since his youth in Poland such as Wojciech Frykowski and Frykowski 's girlfriend , coffee heiress Abigail Folger . Tate and Polanski moved into the Chateau Marmont Hotel in Los Angeles for a few months until they arranged to lease Patty Duke 's home on Summit Ridge Drive in Beverly Hills during the latter part of 1968 . The Polanski house was often full of strangers , and Tate regarded the casual atmosphere as part of the " free spirit " of the times , saying that she did not mind who came into her home as her motto was " live and let live . " Her close friend Leslie Caron later commented that the Polanskis were too trusting — " to the point of recklessness " — and that she had been alarmed by it

                GOLD_MENTION=Sundance last January
                CONTEXT=On January 27 , 2011 the festival sent 9 filmmakers to 9 cities across the US to screen and discuss their films . The cities and films included : Bob Tourtellotte of Reuters wrote " Sundance 2011 has proven to be exceptionally strong , audiences and filmmakers seem to agree . " Tourtellotte reported that Robert Redford said that three years ago the Sundance Institute " set out to get back to its roots of supporting alternative voices in cinema and he felt like this year that strategy paid off . " Redford said " This year , what has excited me , is I think the quality is increasing in diversity and is increasing in depth . " The AP reported that Redford said it 's " always a relief " when the festival ends because " it 's really exhausting . " Kenneth Turan , film critic for the '' Los Angeles Times '' , wrote " though the festival has gotten ever bigger — and ( thankfully ) more efficient in moving its close to 50,000 attendees in and out of its far-flung theaters — it still retains the scrappy , antic spirit that has animated it from the start . " Turan wrote " One of the paradoxes of Sundance is that the quirkiness and charm around the edges of the festival are not always fully appreciated because so much of the media focus is on the premieres section and the U.S. dramatic competition " which he said " are , frankly , often the weakest parts of the festival . " Turan said " Sundance 's insistence on giving equal weight to documentaries and dramas has made it into as important a nonfiction showcase as any festival in the world ; witness the fact that four out of the five Oscar-nominated docs this year debuted at Sundance last January . " He also wrote that the foreign language film competition " is a strength at Sundance , and yet that field is given even less popular attention than the documentaries . " Peter Knegt wrote that this year 's festival " probably wo n't replicate last year 's Oscar record . " He said " Despite a huge surge in sales , this year 's Sundance slate looks like it might be the least Oscar-friendly in some time . " He noted that the U.S. Dramatic Grand Jury Prize winners have been nominated for Best Picture for two years ( referring to '' Precious '' and '' Winter 's Bone '' ) . Knegt speculated on films that might be nominated for the Oscars . Films he deemed " most likely to succeed " at being nominated included : '' Like Crazy '' for Best Picture , Michael Shannon of '' Take Shelter '' for Best Actor , Elizabeth Olsen of '' Martha Marcy May Marlene '' for Best Actress , Felicity Jones of '' Like Crazy '' for Best Actress , Jessica Chastain of '' Take Shelter '' for Best Supporting Actress , '' Project Nim '' for Best Documentary Feature , '' Page One '' for Best Documentary Feature , and '' The Interrupters '' for Best Documentary Feature . He wrote " It 's reasonable to feel assured that at least one of Sundance 's docs will end up an Oscar nominee , if not two , three or four . " Jada Yuan of '' New York '' magazine wrote " perhaps the biggest highlight of the festival is just how ripe it 's been for acquisitions , with nearly 30 films getting picked up , the most at any Sundance ever . " On " why everyone is suddenly so bullish on independent film " , Owen Gleiberman wrote that the " energy and optimism at Sundance this year was n't just hype . " He said the factors he thought were driving a new evolving vision of the indie film world included : " The deals have n’t gotten cheaper — they 've gotten smarter " , a belief that last year 's new festival director John Cooper and director of programming Trevor Groth " have re-energized the festival , heightening its quality and organizing the movies with a tempting new shape and vision " , video on demand gives distributors a safety net and more confidence , and the audiences for Sundance movies are not going away , saying " The Oscars ... have become a testament to the central place that Sundance movies now occupy . " Redford was happy about the success of the festival , with about 45 films being sold vs 14 in 2010 , an increase of about 220 % . Redford said studios are realizing " there are audiences " for indie films

                CONTEXT=The album received mostly positive reviews from critics . David Fricke of '' Rolling Stone '' magazine gave a mostly positive review , describing '' Tragic Kingdom '' as " ear candy with good beats , not just bludgeon-by-numbers guitars " and its music as " a spry , white-suburban take on ska and Blondieesque pop " . Fricke however described " Do n't Speak " as " irritating swill " with " high-pitched rippling " from Gwen Stefani . In 2003 , the album was ranked number 441 on '' Rolling Stone '' magazine 's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time . '' Entertainment Weekly '' s David Browne attributed the album 's sales to Gwen Stefani 's " leggy , bleached-blond calling card " and concluded that " sex still sells " . Browne , however , described the music as " a hefty chunk of new-wave party bounce and Chili Peppers-style white-boy funk , with dashes of reggae , squealing hair-metal guitar , disco , ska-band horns " and the band as sounding like " savvy , lounge-bred pros " . Individual songs were singled out and commented on : " Just a Girl " was described as " a chirpy , ska-tinged bopper " , " Do n't Speak " as " an old-fangled power ballad " , " Sixteen " as a " song of solidarity with misunderstood teenage girls " , and " Spiderwebs " and " End It on This " as " Stefani acknowledg ing obsessions with losers and tr ying to break free . " Calling the album a marked improvement over " the diffuse , rambling songwriting of No Doubt 's two previous CDs " , Mike Boehm of the '' Los Angeles Times '' felt that on the album , " The band is bright , hard-hitting and kinetic , as sharp production captures the core , four-man instrumental team and adjunct horn section at their best " . In a favorable review for '' The Village Voice '' , critic Chuck Eddy felt that although " the album turns pretentious ... No Doubt resurrects the exuberance new-wave guys lost when '80s indie labels and college radio conned them into settling for slam-pit fits and wallflower wallpaper " . AllMusic called it " pure fun " and described the music as something " between '90s punk , third-wave ska , and pop sensibility " and a mix of " new wave melodicism , post-grunge rock , and West Coast sunshine " , indicating the songs " Spiderwebs " , " Just a Girl " , and " Do n't Speak " as " positively ruling the airwaves " . Yahoo! Music reviewer Bill Holdship called the album a " phenomenon " containing " hit after hit " , and describing " Spiderwebs " as " a terrific opener " . Reviewer Robert Christgau called Stefani " hebephrenic " and the album " hyped up " and not " as songful as its fun-besotted partisans claim " . At the 1997 Grammy Awards , No Doubt were nominated for Best New Artist and Best Rock Album

                CONTEXT=Manic Depressive Psychosis ( also known as MDP ) was an Armenian rock group established in 1990 at the Yerevan State University . Their début album Usurper of the Sun Rays was self - released on an MC - cassette in 1993 . It presented a very particular brew that incorporated elements of heavy and at the same time psychedelic music based on sound experimentation . It was hypnotic , heavy and sophisticated . In 1994 , the group might have split , but two musicians of a respected mainstream heavy - metal outfit — Soma — made the band live on . Same year the MDP recorded at Asparez studio their first prog - suite — the River — which today is mentioned in all anthologies of Armenian rock . Next few years the band spent in Russia and released their another album , Take Your Nibbled Apple Back , which boasted eerie vocal experimentations with female vocals . In 2002 , the MDP recorded a very unexpected single , " Falling in Love / Should I " , which incorporated trip - hop elements , but this was short - lived , since the reviews in British and American press would stress that they are particularly great at playing heavier stuff than Portishead / Sylvian moods . Upon opening its own studio , in 2003 and 2004 , MDP produced a range of events themselves : festivals MindPower , concerts and gigs for other popular Armenian rock - bands . They again play very heavy music , close to sympho - rock , though it is always difficult to describe their music . Recent reviews from OverHook Music tell that they have stylistic resemblance with Dream Theatre , while others recommend to remember Mars Volta . They deservedly attracted attention of German independent promoters and concerted in Dresden in 2005 . Now the band also stands as producer of numerous rock - concerts and rock - festivals in Armenia . Vibrographus Studio , headed by band members , boasts the best hardware in Yerevan for production of rock events . One of the band 's 2008 offspring is the Dogma project , which features female vocals augmented with the band 's bass and guitar .

They were married in Chelsea , London , on January 20 , 1968 , with considerable publicity . Polanski was dressed in what the press described as " Edwardian finery " , while Tate was attired in a white minidress . The couple moved into Polanski 's mews house off Eaton Square in Belgravia , London . Photographer Peter Evans later described them as " the imperfect couple . They were the Douglas Fairbanks/Mary Pickford of our time ... Cool , nomadic , talented , and nicely shocking . " While Tate reportedly wanted a traditional marriage , Polanski remained somewhat promiscuous and described Tate 's attitude to his infidelity as " Sharon 's big hang-up " . He reminded Tate that she had promised that she would not try to change him . Tate accepted Polanski 's conditions , though she confided to friends that she hoped he would change . Peter Evans quoted Tate as saying , " We have a good arrangement . Roman lies to me and I pretend to believe him . " Polanski urged Tate to end her association with Martin Ransohoff , and Tate began to place less importance on her career until Polanski told her he wanted to be married to " a hippie , not a housewife . " The couple returned to Los Angeles and quickly became part of a social group that included some of the most successful young people in the film industry , including Warren Beatty , Jacqueline Bisset , Leslie Caron , Joan Collins , Mia Farrow , Jane Fonda , Peter Fonda , Laurence Harvey , Steve McQueen , Joanna Pettet and Peter Sellers ; older film stars like Yul Brynner , Kirk Douglas , Henry Fonda and Danny Kaye ; musicians such as Jim Morrison and The Mamas & the Papas ; and record producer Terry Melcher and his girlfriend , actress Candice Bergen . Jay Sebring remained one of the couple 's more frequent companions . Polanski 's circle of friends included people he had known since his youth in Poland such as Wojciech Frykowski and Frykowski 's girlfriend , coffee heiress Abigail Folger . Tate and Polanski moved into the Chateau Marmont Hotel in Los Angeles for a few months until they arranged to lease Patty Duke 's home on Summit Ridge Drive in Beverly Hills during the latter part of 1968 . The Polanski house was often full of strangers , and Tate regarded the casual atmosphere as part of the " free spirit " of the times , saying that she did not mind who came into her home as her motto was " live and let live . " Her close friend Leslie Caron later commented that the Polanskis were too trusting — " to the point of recklessness " — and that she had been alarmed by it

According to review aggregator Metacritic , the album has a score of 48/100 based on 8 reviews , indicating " mixed or average reviews " . On another aggregator website , Album of the Year , it holds the 4th position on a list of worst reviewed albums of 2014 . Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic gave the album 2.5 stars out of 5 saying that " Michele is not a natural pop star . This was true in 2009 when she debuted on '' Glee '' as Rachel Berry and it 's even clearer in 2014 . " Mike Ayers from '' Billboard '' gave a mostly positive review , saying , " Lyrically , '' Louder '' is rather one-sided , as she often sings about the perils of relationships , over and over , in ways that we 've all heard many times at this point . Still , it 's a solid effort that shows she has promise as a bonafide pop artist . " Sarah Rodman of '' The Boston Globe '' gave the album a mostly positive review , writing , " The Broadway veteran puts her mighty soprano through its paces on bouncy dance tracks , soaring ballads , and midtempo pop tunes where she straddles the line , mostly comfortably , between Katy Perry and Celine Dion . " Kyle Anderson of '' Entertainment Weekly '' gave the album a B - , writing , " It 's hard to be that mad at '' Louder '' , because it 's so admirably and lovingly crafted . There 's nothing wrong with Lea Michele 's debut , and that 's its biggest problem . While well curated and exquisitely executed , '' Louder '' is missing the visceral oomph that defines the gulf between superstars and the rest of the top 40 chum . " At '' USA Today '' , Jerry Shriver rated the album 2.5 stars out of four , and stated that " softer would have been a better approach . " He added that the song " Battlefield " points to a more promising direction . Kevin McFarland of '' The A.V. Club '' gave a C - rating , writing , " '' Louder '' , Michele 's debut solo album under her own name , does feature her distinctive talent as a vocalist . But the record is caught in an unfortunate stylistic limbo between fun-loving , youthful pop and the maturity of adult contemporary artists . " Jim Farber of the '' New York Daily News '' awarded the album two stars . He criticized , " Michele does n't so much sing as trumpet like an elephant eager for the charge . Her voice has more need than vulnerability , more anger than understanding . " Christopher R. Weingarten of '' Rolling Stone '' also gave a negative review , stating , " This album of insta-dated EDM-pop anthems and half-cocked bass drops probably wo n't help Michele 's cause . The songs about love 's ups and downs have a few memorable lyrics ( ' My heart 's too drunk to drive ' ) but not nearly enough . " '' Louder '' was nominated for World 's Best Album at the 2014 World Music Awards , held in Monaco on May 27 , 2014

Katy Kroll of '' Billboard '' recognized it among her top 10 singles of 2000 , calling it " a good old-fashioned depressing song with mainstream flair .

" Scott Mervis of the '' Pittsburgh Post-Gazette '' called it a " rare departure from the usual Blink fare . " Writers for '' The A.V. Club '' listed it among other suicide-related songs in 2009 , describing it as " surprisingly affecting , especially when the band reaches the bombastic chorus , and when the song describes suicide 's crushing aftermath . " In a retrospective review , Chris Payne of '' Billboard '' wrote , " Stylistically , it 's also a Blink breakthrough : rather than putting their heads down and plowing through at breakneck speed , the band dials back the verses and interludes to let them breathe a bit . The resulting chorus achieves an arena-worthy feel not achieved anywhere else on '' Enema of the State '' . " The song caused a controversy in 2000 when it was set to replay indefinitely on a nearby stereo as 17-year-old Greg Barnes , a teenager who attended Columbine High School and had lost one of his best friends in the massacre the previous year , hanged himself in the garage of his family 's home . Both Hoppus and DeLonge were sympathetic but stressed the song 's meaning during an MTV News interview in 2001 : Hoppus also told interviewers that he received fan mail following the song 's release from fans that had contemplated suicide , but decided not to go through with it after hearing the song . '' Rolling Stone '' compared the controversy to that of Ozzy Osbourne 's " Suicide Solution " , which similarly was playing as a teen committed suicide

Richard Harrington of '' The Washington Post '' deemed the song " a powerful exploration of exhaustion and depression . " Alex Pappademas , writing for '' Spin '' , compared the song to the music of Weezer . Katy Kroll of '' Billboard '' recognized it among her top 10 singles of 2000 , calling it " a good old-fashioned depressing song with mainstream flair . " Geoff Boucher , writing for the '' Los Angeles Times '' , called it " a poignant essay on a teen mulling over suicide " ; conversely , Steve Appleford of the '' Los Angeles Times '' dubbed it a " moving if unremarkable examination . " Scott Mervis of the '' Pittsburgh Post-Gazette '' called it a " rare departure from the usual Blink fare . " Writers for '' The A.V. Club '' listed it among other suicide-related songs in 2009 , describing it as " surprisingly affecting , especially when the band reaches the bombastic chorus , and when the song describes suicide 's crushing aftermath . " In a retrospective review , Chris Payne of '' Billboard '' wrote , " Stylistically , it 's also a Blink breakthrough : rather than putting their heads down and plowing through at breakneck speed , the band dials back the verses and interludes to let them breathe a bit . The resulting chorus achieves an arena-worthy feel not achieved anywhere else on '' Enema of the State '' . " The song caused a controversy in 2000 when it was set to replay indefinitely on a nearby stereo as 17-year-old Greg Barnes , a teenager who attended Columbine High School and had lost one of his best friends in the massacre the previous year , hanged himself in the garage of his family 's home . Both Hoppus and DeLonge were sympathetic but stressed the song 's meaning during an MTV News interview in 2001 : Hoppus also told interviewers that he received fan mail following the song 's release from fans that had contemplated suicide , but decided not to go through with it after hearing the song . '' Rolling Stone '' compared the controversy to that of Ozzy Osbourne 's " Suicide Solution " , which similarly was playing as a teen committed suicide

Published in 1970 by Parents ' Magazine Press , the book tells the story of a penniless Army veteran , Benito Badoglio , who becomes rich after he unwittingly gains possession of a magic flying top hat . The book is richly illustrated and the text contains numerous vivid and mellifluous descriptions and dialog . For example , upon meeting the top hat , the protagonist cries , " Thunder of Sebastopole ! " ; in another scene , he shouts , " A thousand Potemkins ! " Other characters in the book are " cutthroats " , " brigands " , a " fainting contessa " , and a " dashing cadet " . The author 's interest in such colorful prose was explained by Selma G. Lanes in the Atlantic Monthly : " Ungerer feels strongly that children enjoy unfamiliar words and euphonious , mystifying phrases . " The setting for The Hat is nineteenth century Italy , and was described by Sydney D. Long in the Horn Book Magazine as " a never - never land ... , the comic - opera pictures of The Hat are full of mandolin - playing musicians , splashing fountains , and apple - cheeked peasant lasses .

                CONTEXT=Music critics favorably reviewed " Never Catch Me " . Named Best New Track by '' Pitchfork Media '' , editor Jayson Greene praised Lamar 's performance , writing " his hyper-vaulting flow and embedded rhyme patterns within rhyme patterns " . For its year-end list of " The 100 Best Tracks of 2014 " , '' Pitchfork '' ranked the song at number 23 . Also commenting on Lamar , '' Billboard '' 's Chris Payne wrote , " There are n't many A-list rappers who could handle a beat like this , but Kendrick is clearly one of them . " '' Rolling Stone '' editor Jon Dolan gave the song three-and-a-half out of five stars , commenting " Over offhandedly lovely , warp-speed psychedelic soul-jazz , Lamar unleashes a word-mad waterfall with a worried emotional core ( " analyze my demise I say I 'm super-anxious " , he raps ) . " '' Consequence of Sound '' editor Nina Corcoran wrote : " when combined with one of Lamar ’s hottest verses to date ( before '' To Pimp a Butterfly '' ) , the song explodes . But it does n’t stop there . FlyLo shows off his talent by shifting gears post-Kendrick verse the only way you can : insane keys , double-time bass drum , and unrelenting hand claps . Eventually , it ’s all swallowed up in massive swelling synth and choral hums , fading to a beautiful , passionate outro . " Directed by Hiro Murai , the video begins at a funeral ( including attendees Flying Lotus and Thundercat in cameo roles ) . Seemingly a sad video , it turns instantly joyful when the two late children - a boy and a girl - bound out of their caskets at the front of the church and dance gleefully down the aisle . The mourners ca n't see the children as they dance right out of the church and out onto a blacktop , but a group of other kids chases after them as they hop in a hearse and drive away . The clip was featured by several publications on their year-end list of best videos , including '' Pitchfork '' , '' Spin '' , and Stereogumwith the latter listing it at number one . The video received two nominations at the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards : Best Choreography and Best Cinematography , ultimately winning the latter

It featured the singles " Crazy Little Thing Called Love " and " Another One Bites the Dust " , both of which reached number one in the US . After attending a Queen concert in Los Angeles , Michael Jackson suggested to Mercury backstage that " Another One Bites the Dust " be released as a single , and in October 1980 it spent three weeks at number one . The album topped the '' Billboard '' 200 for five weeks , and sold over four million copies in the US . It was also the first appearance of a synthesiser on a Queen album . Heretofore , their albums featured a distinctive " No Synthesisers ! " sleeve note . The note is widely assumed to reflect an anti-synth , pro- " hard " - rock stance by the band , but was later revealed by producer Roy Thomas Baker to be an attempt to clarify that those albums ' multi-layered solos were created with guitars , not synths , as record company executives kept assuming at the time . In September 1980 , Queen performed three sold-out shows at Madison Square Garden . In 1980 , Queen also released the soundtrack they had recorded for '' Flash Gordon '' . At the 1981 American Music Awards in January , " Another One Bites the Dust " won the award for Favorite Pop/Rock Single , and Queen were nominated for Favorite Pop/Rock Band , Duo , or Group

                CONTEXT=Living Stage Theatre Company was a theatre for social change founded in 1966 by Robert A. Alexander ( 1929 – 2008 ) . He served as the artistic director until 1995 . Located in Washington , D.C. , this professional improvisational theater offered participatory workshops to children , youth , teachers , parents , and community members . Living Stage ’s main philosophy was based in the belief that every one is born an artist and the act of creation is the ultimate act of self - affirmation . The company 's mission was to transform individuals and communities through creative empowerment . The projects that the Living Stage put on typically dealt with controversial and sensitive topics like race , economic inequality , the dangers of an overzealous American foreign policy , the atom bomb , violence , and freedom . The " Baltimore Incident " of 1971 is an excellent example of how controversial these productions could be . No matter how mixed opinions were , the Living Stage always elicited a reaction with their improvisational performances . During the 1980s the Living Stage began to reach out extensively to local initiatives like The District 's Alcohol and Drug Abuse Services Administration and created their own Community Services Project in order to continue to bring theater and creativity to underserved sections of society . The Living Stage championed New Left ideals like equality and social justice throughout the Reagan years , despite some criticisms about their message being " anachronistic " . The Living Stage dissolved after 36 years and was a venture of Arena Stage .

                CONTEXT=Betrayal is the secondary theme of '' The Wild Bunch '' . The characters suffer from their knowledge of having betrayed a friend and left him to his fate , thus violating their own honor code when it suits them ( " $ 10,000 cuts an awful lot of family ties " ) . However , Bishop says , " When you side with a man , you stay with him , and if you ca n't do that you 're like some animal . " Such oppositional ideas lead to the film 's violent conclusion , as the remaining men find their abandonment of Angel intolerable . Bishop remembers his betrayals , most notably when he deserts Deke Thornton ( in flashback ) when the law catches up to them and when he abandons Crazy Lee at the railroad office after the robbery ( ostensibly to guard the hostages ) . Critic David Weddle writes that , " like that of Conrad 's '' Lord Jim '' , Pike Bishop 's heroism is propelled by overwhelming guilt and a despairing death wish . " Vincent Canby began his review by calling the film " very beautiful and the first truly interesting American-made Western in years . It 's also so full of violence — of an intensity that can hardly be supported by the story — that it 's going to prompt a lot of people who do not know the real effect of movie violence ( as I do not ) to write automatic condemnations of it . " He observed , " Although the movie 's conventional and poetic action sequences are extraordinarily good and its landscapes beautifully photographed ... it is most interesting in its almost jolly account of chaos , corruption , and defeat " . About the actors , he commented particularly on William Holden : " After years of giving bored performances in boring movies , Holden comes back gallantly in '' The Wild Bunch '' . He looks older and tired , but he has style , both as a man and as a movie character who persists in doing what he 's always done , not because he really wants the money but because there 's simply nothing else to do . " '' TIME '' also liked Holden 's performance , describing it as his best since '' Stalag 17 '' ( a 1953 film that earned Holden an Oscar ) , noting Robert Ryan gave " the screen performance of his career " , and concluding that " '' The Wild Bunch '' contains faults and mistakes " ( such as flashbacks " introduced with surprising clumsiness " ) , but " its accomplishments are more than sufficient to confirm that Peckinpah , along with Stanley Kubrick and Arthur Penn , belongs with the best of the newer generation of American filmmakers . " In a 2002 retrospective Roger Ebert , who " saw the original version at the world premiere in 1969 , during the golden age of the junket , when Warner Bros. screened five of its new films in the Bahamas for 450 critics and reporters " , said that back then he had publicly declared the film a masterpiece during the junket 's press conference , prompted by comments from " a reporter from the '' Reader 's Digest '' who got up to ask ' Why was this film ever made ? ' " He compared the film to '' Pulp Fiction '' : " praised and condemned with equal vehemence . " " What '' Citizen Kane '' was to movie lovers in 1941 , '' The Wild Bunch '' was to cineastes in 1969 , " wrote film critic Michael Sragow , who added that Peckinpah had " produced an American movie that equals or surpasses the best of Kurosawa : the Gotterdammerung of Westerns "

Meanwhile in the capital city , a former Interior Ministry official and Communist party member named Ludovic ( Sam Neill ) works at a zoo . He receives a letter from his estranged daughter Anna in Paris who wants to reconcile with her father . With the city under siege , Ludovic volunteers to help the Indian veterinary ( Om Puri ) to look after the animals until they can safely evacuate them . Due to scarce supplies , they are forced to put the animals on rations . Elsewhere , the orphaned Zioig is picked up by a truck carrying United Nations peacekeepers . During the journey , he jumps out of the truck while the peacekeepers are asleep and steals two boxes of supplies . Back in the capital city , Ludovic encounters the militia leader Dragov ( Ulrich Thomsen ) at a checkpoint . Despite lacking identity papers , Dragov lets him through because they are of the same race . Ludovic moves into the zoo and helps the veterinary to look after the animals . Ludovic develops an attachment to a female gibbon named " Luisa . " While visiting the wolves ' pen , Ludovic encounters the orphaned Zioig and tells the boy to leave . Amidst the fighting , Ludovic befriends the Vet while drinking . The Vet tells Ludovic that good men do the right thing in bad times . The following morning , Dragov and his militia visit the zoo and arrests the Vet because he is of a different race . When Ludovic protests , Dragov replies that they will let him go if he is innocent . Ludovic is forced to look after the animals alone . The following morning , Ludovic buries a dead man he finds strung up outside . Later , Zioig returns and forces his way into Ludovic 's cabin with a gun . When the boy faints , Ludovic takes pity on him and tends to the boy 's leg wound with antibiotics . After feeding Zioig , Ludovic tells him that he has to leave the next day because his presence would endanger him . Zioig complies but later returns with a woman , who identifies herself as Zioig ’s mother Ankica . Taking pity on them , Ludovic decides to allow Zioig and his mother to stay . After a blood-stained Zioig returns with cigarettes taken from a man he purportedly found dead , Ankica confides in Ludovic that she is losing touch with her son . While at the zoo ’s butchery , Ankica recounts her experiences in a prison camp where she was raped by a guard who used to be her neighbor . Ankica also begs Ludovic to be kind to her son in order to help him . While Ludovic spends time with Zioig , Ankica reads through Ludovic 's diaries . When Dragov and his militia return to seize the farm animals for food , Ludovic hides Ankica inside a barn . While Dragov and one of his men Slavko ( Srdjan Simeonovich ) search the barn , Ludovic distracts them by giving them a lion cub as a mascot . After the militiamen leave , Ankica kisses Ludovic out of gratitude . Ludovic comforts the distraught Zioig , who is troubled by the suffering zoo animals . When Ludovic discovers that Ankica has been reading through his diaries , he angrily orders them to leave . Zioig storms out in a fit of rage . Ludovic and Ankica eventually discover that her son has gunned down the militiaman Slavko . Ankica searches for her son but he avoids her . Returning to the cabin , Ankica and Ludovic reconcile and develop feelings for each other . The following morning , Ludovic feeds the body of the militiaman to a lion . That night , the zoo 's monkey house is hit by artillery . Ludovic tries to rescue the monkeys but they succumb to the flames , smoke , and trauma .

                GOLD_MENTION=assassination of President Abraham Lincoln
                CONTEXT=The poem , written in free verse in 206 lines , uses many of the literary techniques associated with the pastoral elegy . It was written in the summer of 1865 during a period of profound national mourning in the aftermath of the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln on April 14 , 1865 . Despite the poem being an elegy to the fallen president , Whitman neither mentions Lincoln by name nor discusses the circumstances of his death . Instead , Whitman uses a series of rural and natural imagery including the symbols of the lilacs , a drooping star in the western sky ( Venus ) , and the hermit thrush , and employs the traditional progression of the pastoral elegy in moving from grief toward an acceptance and knowledge of death . The poem also addresses the pity of war through imagery vaguely referencing the American Civil War ( 1861 – 1865 ) which ended only days before the assassination

The album 's overseas success helped the band to develop a larger following outside the US . It received a nomination for Best Metal Performance at the 1993 Grammy Awards , and its title track won a Genesis Award from the Humane Society in 1993 for raising awareness for animal rights issues . Ellefson later said that he and Friedman were disappointed that Megadeth did not win the Grammy : " It was such a bizarre moment , because it was as if the amount of work it had taken to ramp up to that hopeful night was literally gone in a second . " A world tour in support of the album was launched in late 1992 , with Pantera and White Zombie as supporting acts . The tour included a North American leg in early 1993 , with Stone Temple Pilots as the opening act .

High Dive , Lee 's third novel , was published in the UK in 2015 and re-imagined events surrounding the Brighton hotel bombing by the Provisional Irish Republican Army in 1984 , an attempt to assassinate then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher '' The Sunday Times '' called it " an extraordinary performance : vividly written , painfully human and fully fleshing the inner lives of its characters " . '' The Guardian '' , after publishing a review by Jake Arnott , named it among their " books of the year " and stated that it was " a multi-voiced epic that leads towards a stunning finale . " '' The Independent '' , in its review , called Lee " a wordsmith of incomparable eloquence " and also chose it as one of their books of the year . Not all critics were as positive .

" In an interview with Mariella Frostrup for the BBC , Lee defended his decision to tell the story of the real-life bombing through largely fictional characters

                CONTEXT=" Politics " is a poem by Irish poet William Butler Yeats written on May 24 , 1938 . It was composed during the time of the Spanish Civil War as well as during the pre-war period of Adolf Hitler 's Third Reich in Germany . The poem hints at the political situations of Rome ( or Italy ) , Russia , and Spain , but ultimately discusses topics more relevant to private human interaction rather than public , or political situations . The poem never mentions Germany or Hitler , despite the fact that the " war and war 's alarms " surrounding the poem 's creation arose from fears of Germany 's aggression rather than Italy 's , Russia 's , or Spain 's . Many versions of the text exist : the original typescript of May 1938 , the first typescript with hand - written corrections dated August 12 , 1938 , as well as a final " Coole Edition " of the poem dated June 29 , 1939 , which was not published until it was included in Last Poems in 1939 . Yeats intended for the poem to be printed last in the collection , as an envoi to " The Circus Animals ' Desertion " , and while a debate as to the true order of the poems has continued since 1939 , " Politics " was the last lyric poem Yeats wrote and remains the final work printed in all posthumous editions .

                CONTEXT=Living Stage Theatre Company was a theatre for social change founded in 1966 by Robert A. Alexander ( 1929 – 2008 ) . He served as the artistic director until 1995 . Located in Washington , D.C. , this professional improvisational theater offered participatory workshops to children , youth , teachers , parents , and community members . Living Stage ’s main philosophy was based in the belief that every one is born an artist and the act of creation is the ultimate act of self - affirmation . The company 's mission was to transform individuals and communities through creative empowerment . The projects that the Living Stage put on typically dealt with controversial and sensitive topics like race , economic inequality , the dangers of an overzealous American foreign policy , the atom bomb , violence , and freedom . The " Baltimore Incident " of 1971 is an excellent example of how controversial these productions could be . No matter how mixed opinions were , the Living Stage always elicited a reaction with their improvisational performances . During the 1980s the Living Stage began to reach out extensively to local initiatives like The District 's Alcohol and Drug Abuse Services Administration and created their own Community Services Project in order to continue to bring theater and creativity to underserved sections of society . The Living Stage championed New Left ideals like equality and social justice throughout the Reagan years , despite some criticisms about their message being " anachronistic " . The Living Stage dissolved after 36 years and was a venture of Arena Stage .

                CONTEXT=Uzed is the fourth album by Belgian RIO band Univers Zero . Due to a packed touring schedule , the band released this work three years after their previous album proper , Ceux du Dehors ( although the Crawling Wind EP was released in the interim ) . This record marked an important stylistic shift for the band . The synthesizers which had been more moderately employed on Ceux du Dehors ( and not at all in previous works ) became much more prevalent on this release . In fact , the album opens with a synthesizer riff . Along with using more electric sounds , Univers Zero began to take inspiration from Middle Eastern musical themes , especially on the album 's opener , " Présage . " The new sound was partially attributable to the addition of some new band members . André Mergen 's cello work provided some new textures for the ensemble . Michael Delory became the first guitarist employed by the band since the departure of co-founder Roger Trigaux after Heresie . Delory , unlike Trigaux , would play electric guitar with UZ . On Uzed , he plays a notable and unexpected guitar solo at the end of " Célesta ( For Chantal ) . " Jean - Luc Plouvier was the primary keyboardist for this album , and would form a combo within the band with fellow keyboardist Andy Kirk . Kirk would play on and write most of the material for the next UZ album , Heatwave .

The small town some 2 hours driving time north of Durban was established as an manufacturing industrial park in the early eighties . Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi can be credited as one of the drivers behind the establishment of this industrial park - this was at a time when parts of the KwaZulu Natal province of were governed by a separate , tribal regime owing to apartheid policies applicable at that time in the history of South Africa . In the eighties , Mr Buthelezi , had successfully attracted small and medium businesses to the industrial park , with extensive investments from Taiwan . The area , which also has paper mill , was known for low wages , but at its prime , many factories were functional and scores of people from the area were earning some income . Today November 2018 , Isithebe industrial park is a ghost town . Many of the prime industrial sites are silent with rusted structures and gates . The population on the outskirts of the zone has multiplied over the decades . It is a very sad sight . There is speculation , as elsewhere in the globe , that with the dawn of democracy in South Africa in the early 1990s , imports flooded the markets or bluntly put , the Chinese came and squeezed out the Taiwanese , both in business and politically . A drive through iSithebe industrial park is a very sad reminder of what the beloved country of South Africa has become . The park , managed by Ithala Bank , has good infrastructure in terms of water , road , electricity , and desperate ( cheap ) labour . Links to the main roads and airport are good . ISithebe still presents a great opportunity to an entrepreneur or investor .

Based on a short story by Stephen Vincent Benét , the film 's music is by Saul Chaplin and Gene de Paul , with lyrics by Johnny Mercer and choreography by Michael Kidd . Jane Powell plays Milly , an 1850s frontierswoman who marries Adam ( Howard Keel ) only hours after meeting him . When she returns with Adam to his log cabin in the Oregon backwoods , Milly discovers that her husband 's six brothers are uncivilized and oafish . She makes it her mission to domesticate them and , upon Milly 's sarcastic suggestion , the brothers kidnap six women from a neighboring town to marry them . The film was shot in the new CinemaScope format and is remembered for its dance sequences , particularly the " barn raising scene " in which architecture and construction become acrobatic ballet steps . '' Seven Brides for Seven Brothers '' was one of the highest-grossing films of 1954 and appeared on many critics ' 10 Best Films lists . It was nominated for five Academy Awards , including Best Picture and Best Music ( Scoring of a Musical Picture ) , which it won . Its success was a surprise to MGM , which invested more money in two other musicals : '' Rose Marie '' and '' Brigadoon '' , starring Kelly . '' Seven Brides for Seven Brothers '' was more profitable than either of the other films , as well as '' On the Town '' and '' Singin ' in the Rain '' , and its success was a major turning point for Donen 's career . The film was later criticized by novelist Francine Prose , who described it as anti-woman , calling it " one of the most repulsive movies about men and women that has ever been made " and a musical about rape

It featured the singles " Crazy Little Thing Called Love " and " Another One Bites the Dust " , both of which reached number one in the US . After attending a Queen concert in Los Angeles , Michael Jackson suggested to Mercury backstage that " Another One Bites the Dust " be released as a single , and in October 1980 it spent three weeks at number one . The album topped the '' Billboard '' 200 for five weeks , and sold over four million copies in the US . It was also the first appearance of a synthesiser on a Queen album . Heretofore , their albums featured a distinctive " No Synthesisers ! " sleeve note . The note is widely assumed to reflect an anti-synth , pro- " hard " - rock stance by the band , but was later revealed by producer Roy Thomas Baker to be an attempt to clarify that those albums ' multi-layered solos were created with guitars , not synths , as record company executives kept assuming at the time . In September 1980 , Queen performed three sold-out shows at Madison Square Garden . In 1980 , Queen also released the soundtrack they had recorded for '' Flash Gordon '' . At the 1981 American Music Awards in January , " Another One Bites the Dust " won the award for Favorite Pop/Rock Single , and Queen were nominated for Favorite Pop/Rock Band , Duo , or Group

                CONTEXT=In May 2014 , photographer Mert Alas posted on his Instagram account that he was listening to a new Madonna album . '' Billboard '' clarified that she was still in the process of recording it in Los Angeles . They later posted a 50-second snippet of an instrumental which media claimed was from Madonna , but the sample was traced back to Dutch DJ Sander Kleinenberg and his song " We Are Superstars " . Oseary confirmed that Madonna looked forward to a 2015 release date for the album . However , on November 28 , 2014 , two songs titled " Rebel Heart " and " Wash All Over Me " were leaked onto the Internet ; the songs were taken down immediately , and Oseary tweeted asking for help finding the source of the leaks . On December 17 , 2014 , thirteen songs were leaked , as well as artwork suggesting the album was to be named '' Iconic '' . An aggravated Madonna clarified that the songs were demo versions from earlier recordings ; she described the leak as " artistic rape " . The singer was criticized for referring to the hack as " terrorism " , due to the then-recent Peshawar school massacre and the Sydney hostage crisis . Madonna said in a '' Billboard '' interview that after the leak she and her team tried to trace it to the source , but ultimately decided to release the finished songs . Referring to the Sony Pictures Entertainment hack , she was critical of the Internet and explained that the incident led to her securing her laptop and hard drives , and disabling the Wi-Fi . " I wanted to plan everything in advance . Release the single , shoot a video , start talking about my record . And you know , prepare for the release of the entire album and have everything set up just so ... But we sort of were left with no choice " , she added

So I set out to make these tiny little fragments and then , of course , in the poetic sense , the idea of these little sound carrying objects traversing the planet , I started to think of these as a connection , as a sort of postcard into somebody 's life , into their space . " Richter 's 2010 album '' Infra '' takes as its central theme the 2005 terrorist bombings in London , and is an extension of his 25-minute score for a ballet of the same name choreographed by Wayne McGregor and staged at the Royal Opera House . '' Infra '' comprises music written for piano , electronics and string quintet , plus the full performance score and material that subsequently developed from the construction of the album . '' Pitchfork '' described the album as " achingly gorgeous " and '' The Independent '' newspaper characterised it as " a journey in 13 episodes , emerging from a blur of static and finding its way in a repeated phrase that grows in loveliness .

Although Richter said that he had discarded 75 % of Vivaldi 's original material , the parts he does use are phased and looped , emphasising his grounding in postmodern and minimalist music . The album topped the iTunes classical chart in the UK , Germany and the US . The US launch concert in New York at Le Poisson Rouge was recorded by NPR and streamed

The BBC 's Matthew Leyland said " even though all the notes are predictable , the film hits them with a wit , warmth and gusto . " Many critics felt that the film 's format was predictable , and it was widely compared to other films about inspirational teachers , such as '' Dead Poets Society '' , '' Goodbye , Mr. Chips '' and '' Mr. Holland 's Opus '' ; '' The Salt Lake Tribune '' commented " if you 've seen one inspirational-teacher melodrama ... you 've seen this one , too " and criticised the movie 's " one-note characters " and " plodding predictability " . Of the title characters , critic Roger Ebert said : " Their influence will forever change the lives of their students , and we can see that coming from the opening frame " , and that '' The Chorus '' " should have added something new and unexpected " . Ebert also commented that " This feels more like a Hollywood wannabe than a French film . " At the 77th Academy Awards , '' The Chorus '' was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film and Best Original Song ( the latter for " Vois sur ton chemin " , listed as " Look to Your Path " ) . At the 58th British Academy Film Awards , the film was nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay ( Christophe Barratier , Philippe Lopes-Curval ) and Best Film Not in the English Language , and Bruno Coulais ' score was nominated for Best Film Music .

It featured the singles " Crazy Little Thing Called Love " and " Another One Bites the Dust " , both of which reached number one in the US . After attending a Queen concert in Los Angeles , Michael Jackson suggested to Mercury backstage that " Another One Bites the Dust " be released as a single , and in October 1980 it spent three weeks at number one .

Heretofore , their albums featured a distinctive " No Synthesisers ! " sleeve note . The note is widely assumed to reflect an anti-synth , pro- " hard " - rock stance by the band , but was later revealed by producer Roy Thomas Baker to be an attempt to clarify that those albums ' multi-layered solos were created with guitars , not synths , as record company executives kept assuming at the time . In September 1980 , Queen performed three sold-out shows at Madison Square Garden . In 1980 , Queen also released the soundtrack they had recorded for '' Flash Gordon '' . At the 1981 American Music Awards in January , " Another One Bites the Dust " won the award for Favorite Pop/Rock Single , and Queen were nominated for Favorite Pop/Rock Band , Duo , or Group

                CONTEXT=Living Stage Theatre Company was a theatre for social change founded in 1966 by Robert A. Alexander ( 1929 – 2008 ) . He served as the artistic director until 1995 . Located in Washington , D.C. , this professional improvisational theater offered participatory workshops to children , youth , teachers , parents , and community members . Living Stage ’s main philosophy was based in the belief that every one is born an artist and the act of creation is the ultimate act of self - affirmation . The company 's mission was to transform individuals and communities through creative empowerment . The projects that the Living Stage put on typically dealt with controversial and sensitive topics like race , economic inequality , the dangers of an overzealous American foreign policy , the atom bomb , violence , and freedom . The " Baltimore Incident " of 1971 is an excellent example of how controversial these productions could be . No matter how mixed opinions were , the Living Stage always elicited a reaction with their improvisational performances . During the 1980s the Living Stage began to reach out extensively to local initiatives like The District 's Alcohol and Drug Abuse Services Administration and created their own Community Services Project in order to continue to bring theater and creativity to underserved sections of society . The Living Stage championed New Left ideals like equality and social justice throughout the Reagan years , despite some criticisms about their message being " anachronistic " . The Living Stage dissolved after 36 years and was a venture of Arena Stage .

                CONTEXT=Although filming began in 1987 , the film was released only a year after . It turned out to be a box-office failure but won critical acclaim . Balu Mahendra admitted that he did not expect the film to be a box-office success or a failure , but would have the satisfaction of having made a good film . Archana 's portrayal as a middle-class woman fetched her a lot of accolades from the critics . Chokkalinga Bhagavathar , who played her grandfather , received equal praise . He was a strong contender for that year 's National Film Award for Best Actor , but eventually lost to Kamal Haasan . At the 35th National Film Awards , the film won in two categories – Best Feature Film in Tamil , and Best Actress for Archana . The film was among the 16 films to be screened at the Indian Panorama section of the International Film Festival of India in 1988 . In 2002 , the film was screened at the " Indian Summer " section of the Locarno International Film Festival . In a 2013 review , '' Ananda Vikatan '' called '' Veedu '' to be among the two films that took Tamil cinema to world cinema level . Further , it praised the film for highlighting the plight of Indian middle-class families and the political set up of the nation . It stated '' Veedu '' was one of the few Tamil films that scores good on both content and narration , and also appreciated Balu Mahendra 's directorial skills . Critics praised the film for being more visual and Balu Mahendra 's understanding of cinema as a visual medium . However , the magazine criticised the usage of background score in the film as it felt it lessened the impact of an otherwise good film . S. Theodore Baskaran in his '' The Eye of The Serpent : An Introduction To Tamil Cinema '' states that '' Veedu '' was a " striking departure " from the previous films of Balu Mahendra , as it was devoid of commercial elements like dance , songs , fight and comedy sequences . While analysing Archana 's characterisation , Baskaran noted Balu Mahendra 's penchant for strong characterisation of his female leads . Balu Mahendra had to construct a house which was mean to be a set for the house which was shown in the film . The building which was later fully constructed , now houses the film school started by Balu Mahendra in 2007 . In many interviews , Balu Mahendra had claimed that '' Veedu '' and '' Sandhya Raagam '' were the only films that satisfied him the most as he made these two the least number of mistakes and compromises . The film is widely considered to be one of the finest works of Balu Mahendra . The negative of the film is lost

So I set out to make these tiny little fragments and then , of course , in the poetic sense , the idea of these little sound carrying objects traversing the planet , I started to think of these as a connection , as a sort of postcard into somebody 's life , into their space . " Richter 's 2010 album '' Infra '' takes as its central theme the 2005 terrorist bombings in London , and is an extension of his 25-minute score for a ballet of the same name choreographed by Wayne McGregor and staged at the Royal Opera House . '' Infra '' comprises music written for piano , electronics and string quintet , plus the full performance score and material that subsequently developed from the construction of the album . '' Pitchfork '' described the album as " achingly gorgeous " and '' The Independent '' newspaper characterised it as " a journey in 13 episodes , emerging from a blur of static and finding its way in a repeated phrase that grows in loveliness . " Richter 's recomposed version of Vivaldi 's '' The Four Seasons '' , '' Recomposed by Max Richter : Vivaldi – The Four Seasons '' , was premiered in the UK at the Barbican Centre on 31 October 2012 , performed by the Britten Sinfonia , conducted by André de Ridder and with violinist Daniel Hope . Although Richter said that he had discarded 75 % of Vivaldi 's original material , the parts he does use are phased and looped , emphasising his grounding in postmodern and minimalist music . The album topped the iTunes classical chart in the UK , Germany and the US . The US launch concert in New York at Le Poisson Rouge was recorded by NPR and streamed

In the second , Kim Coolzip presents a seductive commercial for liquid meat , which segues into her appearance on a charity fund-raising telethon . The third is the game show , in which Skip Coolzip " gives back " to Native Americans his family 's car , then his father 's squad car ( " the black screamer " ) , and finally , " everything .

According to review aggregator Metacritic , the album has a score of 48/100 based on 8 reviews , indicating " mixed or average reviews " . On another aggregator website , Album of the Year , it holds the 4th position on a list of worst reviewed albums of 2014 . Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic gave the album 2.5 stars out of 5 saying that " Michele is not a natural pop star . This was true in 2009 when she debuted on '' Glee '' as Rachel Berry and it 's even clearer in 2014 . " Mike Ayers from '' Billboard '' gave a mostly positive review , saying , " Lyrically , '' Louder '' is rather one-sided , as she often sings about the perils of relationships , over and over , in ways that we 've all heard many times at this point . Still , it 's a solid effort that shows she has promise as a bonafide pop artist . " Sarah Rodman of '' The Boston Globe '' gave the album a mostly positive review , writing , " The Broadway veteran puts her mighty soprano through its paces on bouncy dance tracks , soaring ballads , and midtempo pop tunes where she straddles the line , mostly comfortably , between Katy Perry and Celine Dion . " Kyle Anderson of '' Entertainment Weekly '' gave the album a B - , writing , " It 's hard to be that mad at '' Louder '' , because it 's so admirably and lovingly crafted . There 's nothing wrong with Lea Michele 's debut , and that 's its biggest problem . While well curated and exquisitely executed , '' Louder '' is missing the visceral oomph that defines the gulf between superstars and the rest of the top 40 chum . " At '' USA Today '' , Jerry Shriver rated the album 2.5 stars out of four , and stated that " softer would have been a better approach . " He added that the song " Battlefield " points to a more promising direction . Kevin McFarland of '' The A.V. Club '' gave a C - rating , writing , " '' Louder '' , Michele 's debut solo album under her own name , does feature her distinctive talent as a vocalist . But the record is caught in an unfortunate stylistic limbo between fun-loving , youthful pop and the maturity of adult contemporary artists . " Jim Farber of the '' New York Daily News '' awarded the album two stars . He criticized , " Michele does n't so much sing as trumpet like an elephant eager for the charge . Her voice has more need than vulnerability , more anger than understanding . " Christopher R. Weingarten of '' Rolling Stone '' also gave a negative review , stating , " This album of insta-dated EDM-pop anthems and half-cocked bass drops probably wo n't help Michele 's cause . The songs about love 's ups and downs have a few memorable lyrics ( ' My heart 's too drunk to drive ' ) but not nearly enough .

                CONTEXT=In the 1959 review for '' Sight & Sound '' , David Vaughan calls '' Gigi '' " an elegant film " with a " cultivated visual taste which is everywhere apparent " . He summarises that " while '' Gigi '' does not represent a revival of the MGM musical in its heyday , it is a welcome extension of latter-day musical style in its adult subject-matter and its avoidance of spectacle made vulgar by emphasis on size . " He praises Minnelli 's talent for " the delicious amorality of the anecdote , but also the honesty and irony of its telling which have become foreign to the American cinema . " Vaughan points out " Chevalier 's practiced but irresistible charm as one of the film 's greatest assets " as well as " the brilliant high-comedy playing of Isabel Jeans , who as Aunt Alicia consummately portrays the distinction and beauty of a retired aristocrat of the '' demimonde '' . " Bosley Crowther of '' The New York Times '' called it " a musical film that bears such a basic resemblance to '' My Fair Lady '' that the authors may want to sue themselves " . He added , " But do n't think this point of resemblance is made in criticism of the film , for '' Gigi '' is a charming entertainment that can stand on its own two legs . It is not only a charming comprehension of the spicy confection of Colette , but it is also a lovely and lyrical enlargement upon that story 's flavored mood and atmosphere … Vincente Minnelli has marshaled a cast to give a set of performances that , for quality and harmony , are superb . " Abel Green of '' Variety '' called the film " 100 % escapist fare " and predicted it " is destined for a global box-office mop-up " . He added , " Alan Jay Lerner 's libretto is tailor-made for an inspired casting job for all principals , and Fritz Loewe 's tunes ( to Lerner 's lyrics ) already vie with and suggest their memorable '' My Fair Lady '' score … Miss Caron is completely captivating and convincing in the title role … Skillful casting , performance and presentation have endowed realism to the sum total … Director Minnelli 's good taste in keeping it in bounds and the general sound judgment of all concerned … distinguishes this Arthur Freed independent production . The Metrocolor rates recognition for its soft pastels under Joseph Ruttenberg 's lensing ; the Beaton costumes , sets and general production design are vivid physical assets at first sight . The skillful integration of words-and-music with the plot motivation makes this '' Gigi '' a very fair lady indeed as a boxoffice entry . " '' Time Out New York '' said , " The dominating creative contribution comes from Minnelli and Cecil Beaton … The combination of these two visual elitists is really too much — it 's like a meal consisting of cheesecake , and one quickly longs for something solid and vulgar to weigh things down . No doubt inspired by the finicky , claustrophobic sets and bric-à-brac , the cast tries ( with unfortunate success ) to be more French than the French , especially Chevalier . The exception is Gingold , who inhabits , as always , a world of her own . " '' TV Guide '' rated the film 3 ½ out of five stars , calling it " Overbaked but enjoyable , and a banquet for the eyes , thanks to the visual wonder of the Minnelli-Beaton teaming … Caron … leads the cast in a contest to see who can be the most French . The winner is Chevalier , in a performance that makes one feel as if you 're gagging on pastry … Perhaps if the sweetness of '' Gigi '' was contrasted with elements of honest vulgarity , the picture could balance itself out … Ten minutes into the movie , you 've resolved the plot and are left to wallow in lovely frou-frou . The film makes wonderful use of the usual Parisian landmarks , and benefits from extraordinary period costumes and sets . " '' Gigi '' won a record-breaking nine Academy Awards ( at the 1959 Oscars ceremony ) ; however , this record only lasted for one year , as '' Ben-Hur '' broke this record the following year with 11 Oscars . In tribute to '' Gigi '' s domination of the Oscars , the MGM switchboard answered calls the following day with " M-Gigi-M " . '' Gigi '' , eventually along with 1987 's '' The Last Emperor '' , held the record as the film ( s ) with the most Academy Award wins in every category in which it was nominated , until 2003 's '' The Lord of the Rings : The Return of the King '' broke the record at the 2004 Oscars ceremony with 11 Oscar nominations and 11 Oscar wins

Its 14 minutes consisted of a number of scenes depicting Tate filming '' Eye of the Devil '' , dancing in nightclubs , and sightseeing around London , and also contained a brief interview with her . Asked about her acting ambitions , she replied , " I do n't fool myself . I ca n't see myself doing Shakespeare . " She spoke of her hopes of finding a niche in comedy , and in other interviews she expressed her desire to become " a light comedienne in the Carole Lombard style " . She discussed the type of contemporary actress she wanted to emulate and explained that there were two in particular that she was influenced by : Faye Dunaway and Catherine Deneuve . Of the latter , she said , " I 'd like to be an American Catherine Deneuve . She plays beautiful , sensitive , deep parts with a little bit of intelligence behind them . " Later in the year , '' Valley of the Dolls '' opened to almost uniformly negative reviews . Bosley Crowther wrote in '' The New York Times '' , " all a fairly respectful admirer of movies can do is laugh at it and turn away " . '' Newsweek '' said that the film " has no more sense of its own ludicrousness than a village idiot stumbling in manure " , but a later article read : " Astoundingly photogenic , infinitely curvaceous , Sharon Tate is one of the most smashing young things to hit Hollywood in a long time . " The three lead actresses were castigated in numerous publications , including '' The Saturday Review '' , which wrote , " Ten years ago ... Parkins , Duke , and Tate would more likely have been playing the hat check girls than movie-queens ; they are totally lacking in style , authority , or charm . " '' The Hollywood Reporter '' provided some positive comments , such as , " Sharon Tate emerges as the film 's most sympathetic character ... William H. Daniels ' photographic caress of her faultless face and enormous absorbent eyes is stunning . " Roger Ebert of the '' Chicago Sun-Times '' praised Tate as " a wonder to behold " , but after describing the dialogue in one scene as " the most offensive and appalling vulgarity ever thrown up by any civilization " , concluded that , " I will be unable to take her any more seriously as a sex symbol than Raquel Welch . " In late 1967 , Tate and Polanski returned to London and were frequent subjects of newspaper and magazine articles . Tate was depicted as being untraditional and modern , and was quoted as saying couples should live together before marrying . They were married in Chelsea , London , on January 20 , 1968 , with considerable publicity . Polanski was dressed in what the press described as " Edwardian finery " , while Tate was attired in a white minidress . The couple moved into Polanski 's mews house off Eaton Square in Belgravia , London . Photographer Peter Evans later described them as " the imperfect couple . They were the Douglas Fairbanks/Mary Pickford of our time ... Cool , nomadic , talented , and nicely shocking . " While Tate reportedly wanted a traditional marriage , Polanski remained somewhat promiscuous and described Tate 's attitude to his infidelity as " Sharon 's big hang-up " . He reminded Tate that she had promised that she would not try to change him . Tate accepted Polanski 's conditions , though she confided to friends that she hoped he would change . Peter Evans quoted Tate as saying , " We have a good arrangement . Roman lies to me and I pretend to believe him . " Polanski urged Tate to end her association with Martin Ransohoff , and Tate began to place less importance on her career until Polanski told her he wanted to be married to " a hippie , not a housewife . " The couple returned to Los Angeles and quickly became part of a social group that included some of the most successful young people in the film industry , including Warren Beatty , Jacqueline Bisset , Leslie Caron , Joan Collins , Mia Farrow , Jane Fonda , Peter Fonda , Laurence Harvey , Steve McQueen , Joanna Pettet and Peter Sellers ; older film stars like Yul Brynner , Kirk Douglas , Henry Fonda and Danny Kaye ; musicians such as Jim Morrison and The Mamas & the Papas ; and record producer Terry Melcher and his girlfriend , actress Candice Bergen . Jay Sebring remained one of the couple 's more frequent companions . Polanski 's circle of friends included people he had known since his youth in Poland such as Wojciech Frykowski and Frykowski 's girlfriend , coffee heiress Abigail Folger . Tate and Polanski moved into the Chateau Marmont Hotel in Los Angeles for a few months until they arranged to lease Patty Duke 's home on Summit Ridge Drive in Beverly Hills during the latter part of 1968 . The Polanski house was often full of strangers , and Tate regarded the casual atmosphere as part of the " free spirit " of the times , saying that she did not mind who came into her home as her motto was " live and let live . " Her close friend Leslie Caron later commented that the Polanskis were too trusting — " to the point of recklessness " — and that she had been alarmed by it

                GOLD_MENTION=Columbine High School massacre
                CONTEXT='' Give a Boy a Gun '' is an epistolary novel for young adults by Todd Strasser , first published in 2000 . The novel describes the events and social circumstances that lead up to , and form the aftermath of , a fictional school shooting . The story is presented in the form of segments of transcribed post-incident interviews with students , parents , teachers , and community members , compiled by Denise Shipley , a journalism student who is the stepsister of one of the shooters . The interviews provide a variety of viewpoints on the incident – some sympathetic , others hostile . Interspersed through the book are footnotes providing statistical information about guns and gun violence . The plot has some similarities to the real-life Columbine High School massacre of April 20 , 1999 , although Strasser began research on the book before the Columbine shooting . The book was the first book relating to school shootings published after Columbine . Brendan Lawlor and Gary Searle are students at Middletown High School . Gary has lived in town since second grade , while Brendan is a new arrival . The two quickly become friends . They are subjected to verbal and physical bullying by football players at Middletown , which teachers and parents fail to notice , downplay , or outright ignore . As time passes , both boys become darker and angrier , experimenting with alcohol and drugs , becoming obsessive about violent video games , and withdrawing from most social activities . Eventually the boys begin to obsess over the possibility of acting on their violent impulses . Gary experiments with developing a powerful homemade bomb . Gary and Brendan steal semi-automatic guns from a neighbour . Meanwhile , students are excited about an upcoming dance to be held in the school 's gym . On the night of the dance , Brendan leaves a cryptic message for his friend Emily , warning her not to attend because there will be trouble . Masked , Brendan and Gary enter the gym just after the dance begins . They shoot out the lights before restraining the attendees with cable ties . Gary booby-traps the doors with bombs so they will explode if anyone tries to open them . The pair approach the football team 's quarterback , Sam , who has been one of their main tormentors . After some debate , they decide to shoot out his kneecaps so he will be unable to play football ever again . Gary and Brendan fire their guns randomly around the gym , scaring students and injuring others . Another football player , Dustin , manages to get free and unties some others . Gary commits suicide while Brendan is beaten into a coma by the football players . Brendan suffers irreversible brain damage from the beating and those responsible are arrested and put on trial for attempted murder . The book ends with Denise Shipley , Gary 's stepsister , wondering if Gary knew if there were other options besides violence . She swears she will always treat others with respect and teach others to do the same . She also shares her belief that semi-automatic weapons should be outlawed and handguns should be only in the hands of law enforcement

                CONTEXT=The '' All Eyes on Sharon Tate '' documentary was used to publicize the film . Its 14 minutes consisted of a number of scenes depicting Tate filming '' Eye of the Devil '' , dancing in nightclubs , and sightseeing around London , and also contained a brief interview with her . Asked about her acting ambitions , she replied , " I do n't fool myself . I ca n't see myself doing Shakespeare . " She spoke of her hopes of finding a niche in comedy , and in other interviews she expressed her desire to become " a light comedienne in the Carole Lombard style " . She discussed the type of contemporary actress she wanted to emulate and explained that there were two in particular that she was influenced by : Faye Dunaway and Catherine Deneuve . Of the latter , she said , " I 'd like to be an American Catherine Deneuve . She plays beautiful , sensitive , deep parts with a little bit of intelligence behind them . " Later in the year , '' Valley of the Dolls '' opened to almost uniformly negative reviews . Bosley Crowther wrote in '' The New York Times '' , " all a fairly respectful admirer of movies can do is laugh at it and turn away " . '' Newsweek '' said that the film " has no more sense of its own ludicrousness than a village idiot stumbling in manure " , but a later article read : " Astoundingly photogenic , infinitely curvaceous , Sharon Tate is one of the most smashing young things to hit Hollywood in a long time . " The three lead actresses were castigated in numerous publications , including '' The Saturday Review '' , which wrote , " Ten years ago ... Parkins , Duke , and Tate would more likely have been playing the hat check girls than movie-queens ; they are totally lacking in style , authority , or charm . " '' The Hollywood Reporter '' provided some positive comments , such as , " Sharon Tate emerges as the film 's most sympathetic character ... William H. Daniels ' photographic caress of her faultless face and enormous absorbent eyes is stunning . " Roger Ebert of the '' Chicago Sun-Times '' praised Tate as " a wonder to behold " , but after describing the dialogue in one scene as " the most offensive and appalling vulgarity ever thrown up by any civilization " , concluded that , " I will be unable to take her any more seriously as a sex symbol than Raquel Welch . " In late 1967 , Tate and Polanski returned to London and were frequent subjects of newspaper and magazine articles . Tate was depicted as being untraditional and modern , and was quoted as saying couples should live together before marrying . They were married in Chelsea , London , on January 20 , 1968 , with considerable publicity . Polanski was dressed in what the press described as " Edwardian finery " , while Tate was attired in a white minidress . The couple moved into Polanski 's mews house off Eaton Square in Belgravia , London . Photographer Peter Evans later described them as " the imperfect couple . They were the Douglas Fairbanks/Mary Pickford of our time ... Cool , nomadic , talented , and nicely shocking . " While Tate reportedly wanted a traditional marriage , Polanski remained somewhat promiscuous and described Tate 's attitude to his infidelity as " Sharon 's big hang-up " . He reminded Tate that she had promised that she would not try to change him . Tate accepted Polanski 's conditions , though she confided to friends that she hoped he would change . Peter Evans quoted Tate as saying , " We have a good arrangement . Roman lies to me and I pretend to believe him . " Polanski urged Tate to end her association with Martin Ransohoff , and Tate began to place less importance on her career until Polanski told her he wanted to be married to " a hippie , not a housewife . " The couple returned to Los Angeles and quickly became part of a social group that included some of the most successful young people in the film industry , including Warren Beatty , Jacqueline Bisset , Leslie Caron , Joan Collins , Mia Farrow , Jane Fonda , Peter Fonda , Laurence Harvey , Steve McQueen , Joanna Pettet and Peter Sellers ; older film stars like Yul Brynner , Kirk Douglas , Henry Fonda and Danny Kaye ; musicians such as Jim Morrison and The Mamas & the Papas ; and record producer Terry Melcher and his girlfriend , actress Candice Bergen . Jay Sebring remained one of the couple 's more frequent companions . Polanski 's circle of friends included people he had known since his youth in Poland such as Wojciech Frykowski and Frykowski 's girlfriend , coffee heiress Abigail Folger . Tate and Polanski moved into the Chateau Marmont Hotel in Los Angeles for a few months until they arranged to lease Patty Duke 's home on Summit Ridge Drive in Beverly Hills during the latter part of 1968 . The Polanski house was often full of strangers , and Tate regarded the casual atmosphere as part of the " free spirit " of the times , saying that she did not mind who came into her home as her motto was " live and let live . " Her close friend Leslie Caron later commented that the Polanskis were too trusting — " to the point of recklessness " — and that she had been alarmed by it

For its year-end list of " The 100 Best Tracks of 2014 " , '' Pitchfork '' ranked the song at number 23 . Also commenting on Lamar , '' Billboard '' 's Chris Payne wrote , " There are n't many A-list rappers who could handle a beat like this , but Kendrick is clearly one of them . " '' Rolling Stone '' editor Jon Dolan gave the song three-and-a-half out of five stars , commenting " Over offhandedly lovely , warp-speed psychedelic soul-jazz , Lamar unleashes a word-mad waterfall with a worried emotional core ( " analyze my demise I say I 'm super-anxious " , he raps ) . " '' Consequence of Sound '' editor Nina Corcoran wrote : " when combined with one of Lamar ’s hottest verses to date ( before '' To Pimp a Butterfly '' ) , the song explodes . But it does n’t stop there . FlyLo shows off his talent by shifting gears post-Kendrick verse the only way you can : insane keys , double-time bass drum , and unrelenting hand claps . Eventually , it ’s all swallowed up in massive swelling synth and choral hums , fading to a beautiful , passionate outro . " Directed by Hiro Murai , the video begins at a funeral ( including attendees Flying Lotus and Thundercat in cameo roles ) . Seemingly a sad video , it turns instantly joyful when the two late children - a boy and a girl - bound out of their caskets at the front of the church and dance gleefully down the aisle . The mourners ca n't see the children as they dance right out of the church and out onto a blacktop , but a group of other kids chases after them as they hop in a hearse and drive away . The clip was featured by several publications on their year-end list of best videos , including '' Pitchfork '' , '' Spin '' , and Stereogumwith the latter listing it at number one . The video received two nominations at the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards : Best Choreography and Best Cinematography , ultimately winning the latter

" Andrea Gronvall of the '' Chicago Reader '' wrote that " The formula works , thanks in large part to star Jennifer Garner , who 's so radiant theaters should be stocking sunblock . Underlying the shenanigans and the pop-psychology moral — self-love is a prerequisite for true love — there 's a touching wistfulness about roads not taken . " Jorge Morales of '' The Village Voice '' commented : " The thirtysomething in me was all , gag me with a spoon , but the kid in me was like , this movie 's rad to the max . " Garner was nominated for MTV Movie Award and Teen Choice awards for her role as Jenna Rink

                CONTEXT=Some of the most unfavorable reviews came from major American newspapers . A. O. Scott of '' The New York Times '' describes '' 300 '' as " about as violent as '' Apocalypto '' and twice as stupid , " while criticizing its color scheme and suggesting that its plot includes racist undertones ; Scott also poked fun at the buffed bodies of the actors portraying the Spartans , declaring that the Persian characters are " pioneers in the art of face-piercing " , but that the Spartans had access to " superior health clubs and electrolysis facilities " . Kenneth Turan writes in the '' Los Angeles Times '' that " unless you love violence as much as a Spartan , Quentin Tarantino or a video-game-playing teenage boy , you will not be endlessly fascinated . " Roger Ebert , in his review , gave the film a two-star rating , writing , " '' 300 '' has one-dimensional caricatures who talk like professional wrestlers plugging their next feud . " Some critics employed at Greek newspapers have been particularly critical , such as film critic Robby Eksiel , who said that moviegoers would be dazzled by the " digital action " but irritated by the " pompous interpretations and one-dimensional characters . " '' Variety '' Todd McCarthy describes the film as " visually arresting " although " bombastic " while Kirk Honeycutt , writing in '' The Hollywood Reporter '' , praises the " beauty of its topography , colors and forms . " Writing in the '' Chicago Sun Times '' , Richard Roeper acclaims '' 300 '' as " the '' Citizen Kane '' of cinematic graphic novels . " '' Empire '' gave the film 3 out of 5 having a verdict of " Visually stunning , thoroughly belligerent and as shallow as a pygmy 's paddling pool , this is a whole heap of style tinged with just a smidgen of substance . " '' 300 '' was also warmly received by websites focusing on comics and video games . Comic Book Resources ' Mark Cronan found the film compelling , leaving him " with a feeling of power , from having been witness to something grand . " IGN 's Todd Gilchrist acclaimed Zack Snyder as a cinematic visionary and " a possible redeemer of modern moviemaking . " At the MTV Movie Awards 2007 , '' 300 '' was nominated for Best Movie , Best Performance for Gerard Butler , Best Breakthrough Performance for Lena Headey , Best Villain for Rodrigo Santoro , and Best Fight for Leonidas battling " the Über Immortal " , but only won the award for Best Fight . '' 300 '' won both the Best Dramatic Film and Best Action Film honors in the 2006 – 2007 Golden Icon Awards presented by Travolta Family Entertainment . In December 2007 , '' 300 '' won IGN 's Movie of the Year 2007 , along with Best Comic Book Adaptation and King Leonidas as Favorite Character . The movie received 10 nominations for the 2008 Saturn Awards , winning the awards for Best Director and Best Action/Adventure/Thriller Film .

It is of a slender , almost fully vertical shape on all sides , rising 300 metres straight up . The mountain is named for its similarity in shape to a belltower ( It. : campanile ) and it being low ( It. : basso ) compared to the neighboring Campanile Alto and Brenta Alta . The German alpinist Karl Schulz introduced in 1884 the name Guglia di Brenta ( " Guglia = " spire " ) , a name widely used until World War I and especially enduring in German literature , but considered inappropriate by locals and Italian climbers . Geologically , Campanile Basso is entirely formed of Triassic sedimentary rock , dense and compact dolomite . Due to its inaccessible appearance it was long left untouched during the alpine exploration of the Eastern Alps . Around the turn of the century a competitive race for the first ascent started , which took inspiration from the emerging nationalistic feelings in the region , as much as from the ascent of rock climbing as a sport . Most of the illustrious forebears of modern rock climbing climbed this mountain during the first half of the Twentieth century .

                CONTEXT=The '' All Eyes on Sharon Tate '' documentary was used to publicize the film . Its 14 minutes consisted of a number of scenes depicting Tate filming '' Eye of the Devil '' , dancing in nightclubs , and sightseeing around London , and also contained a brief interview with her . Asked about her acting ambitions , she replied , " I do n't fool myself . I ca n't see myself doing Shakespeare . " She spoke of her hopes of finding a niche in comedy , and in other interviews she expressed her desire to become " a light comedienne in the Carole Lombard style " . She discussed the type of contemporary actress she wanted to emulate and explained that there were two in particular that she was influenced by : Faye Dunaway and Catherine Deneuve . Of the latter , she said , " I 'd like to be an American Catherine Deneuve . She plays beautiful , sensitive , deep parts with a little bit of intelligence behind them . " Later in the year , '' Valley of the Dolls '' opened to almost uniformly negative reviews . Bosley Crowther wrote in '' The New York Times '' , " all a fairly respectful admirer of movies can do is laugh at it and turn away " . '' Newsweek '' said that the film " has no more sense of its own ludicrousness than a village idiot stumbling in manure " , but a later article read : " Astoundingly photogenic , infinitely curvaceous , Sharon Tate is one of the most smashing young things to hit Hollywood in a long time . " The three lead actresses were castigated in numerous publications , including '' The Saturday Review '' , which wrote , " Ten years ago ... Parkins , Duke , and Tate would more likely have been playing the hat check girls than movie-queens ; they are totally lacking in style , authority , or charm . " '' The Hollywood Reporter '' provided some positive comments , such as , " Sharon Tate emerges as the film 's most sympathetic character ... William H. Daniels ' photographic caress of her faultless face and enormous absorbent eyes is stunning . " Roger Ebert of the '' Chicago Sun-Times '' praised Tate as " a wonder to behold " , but after describing the dialogue in one scene as " the most offensive and appalling vulgarity ever thrown up by any civilization " , concluded that , " I will be unable to take her any more seriously as a sex symbol than Raquel Welch . " In late 1967 , Tate and Polanski returned to London and were frequent subjects of newspaper and magazine articles . Tate was depicted as being untraditional and modern , and was quoted as saying couples should live together before marrying . They were married in Chelsea , London , on January 20 , 1968 , with considerable publicity . Polanski was dressed in what the press described as " Edwardian finery " , while Tate was attired in a white minidress . The couple moved into Polanski 's mews house off Eaton Square in Belgravia , London . Photographer Peter Evans later described them as " the imperfect couple . They were the Douglas Fairbanks/Mary Pickford of our time ... Cool , nomadic , talented , and nicely shocking . " While Tate reportedly wanted a traditional marriage , Polanski remained somewhat promiscuous and described Tate 's attitude to his infidelity as " Sharon 's big hang-up " . He reminded Tate that she had promised that she would not try to change him . Tate accepted Polanski 's conditions , though she confided to friends that she hoped he would change . Peter Evans quoted Tate as saying , " We have a good arrangement . Roman lies to me and I pretend to believe him . " Polanski urged Tate to end her association with Martin Ransohoff , and Tate began to place less importance on her career until Polanski told her he wanted to be married to " a hippie , not a housewife . " The couple returned to Los Angeles and quickly became part of a social group that included some of the most successful young people in the film industry , including Warren Beatty , Jacqueline Bisset , Leslie Caron , Joan Collins , Mia Farrow , Jane Fonda , Peter Fonda , Laurence Harvey , Steve McQueen , Joanna Pettet and Peter Sellers ; older film stars like Yul Brynner , Kirk Douglas , Henry Fonda and Danny Kaye ; musicians such as Jim Morrison and The Mamas & the Papas ; and record producer Terry Melcher and his girlfriend , actress Candice Bergen . Jay Sebring remained one of the couple 's more frequent companions . Polanski 's circle of friends included people he had known since his youth in Poland such as Wojciech Frykowski and Frykowski 's girlfriend , coffee heiress Abigail Folger . Tate and Polanski moved into the Chateau Marmont Hotel in Los Angeles for a few months until they arranged to lease Patty Duke 's home on Summit Ridge Drive in Beverly Hills during the latter part of 1968 . The Polanski house was often full of strangers , and Tate regarded the casual atmosphere as part of the " free spirit " of the times , saying that she did not mind who came into her home as her motto was " live and let live . " Her close friend Leslie Caron later commented that the Polanskis were too trusting — " to the point of recklessness " — and that she had been alarmed by it

                CONTEXT=Manic Depressive Psychosis ( also known as MDP ) was an Armenian rock group established in 1990 at the Yerevan State University . Their début album Usurper of the Sun Rays was self - released on an MC - cassette in 1993 . It presented a very particular brew that incorporated elements of heavy and at the same time psychedelic music based on sound experimentation . It was hypnotic , heavy and sophisticated . In 1994 , the group might have split , but two musicians of a respected mainstream heavy - metal outfit — Soma — made the band live on . Same year the MDP recorded at Asparez studio their first prog - suite — the River — which today is mentioned in all anthologies of Armenian rock . Next few years the band spent in Russia and released their another album , Take Your Nibbled Apple Back , which boasted eerie vocal experimentations with female vocals . In 2002 , the MDP recorded a very unexpected single , " Falling in Love / Should I " , which incorporated trip - hop elements , but this was short - lived , since the reviews in British and American press would stress that they are particularly great at playing heavier stuff than Portishead / Sylvian moods . Upon opening its own studio , in 2003 and 2004 , MDP produced a range of events themselves : festivals MindPower , concerts and gigs for other popular Armenian rock - bands . They again play very heavy music , close to sympho - rock , though it is always difficult to describe their music . Recent reviews from OverHook Music tell that they have stylistic resemblance with Dream Theatre , while others recommend to remember Mars Volta . They deservedly attracted attention of German independent promoters and concerted in Dresden in 2005 . Now the band also stands as producer of numerous rock - concerts and rock - festivals in Armenia . Vibrographus Studio , headed by band members , boasts the best hardware in Yerevan for production of rock events . One of the band 's 2008 offspring is the Dogma project , which features female vocals augmented with the band 's bass and guitar .

                CONTEXT=Music critics favorably reviewed " Never Catch Me " . Named Best New Track by '' Pitchfork Media '' , editor Jayson Greene praised Lamar 's performance , writing " his hyper-vaulting flow and embedded rhyme patterns within rhyme patterns " . For its year-end list of " The 100 Best Tracks of 2014 " , '' Pitchfork '' ranked the song at number 23 . Also commenting on Lamar , '' Billboard '' 's Chris Payne wrote , " There are n't many A-list rappers who could handle a beat like this , but Kendrick is clearly one of them . " '' Rolling Stone '' editor Jon Dolan gave the song three-and-a-half out of five stars , commenting " Over offhandedly lovely , warp-speed psychedelic soul-jazz , Lamar unleashes a word-mad waterfall with a worried emotional core ( " analyze my demise I say I 'm super-anxious " , he raps ) . " '' Consequence of Sound '' editor Nina Corcoran wrote : " when combined with one of Lamar ’s hottest verses to date ( before '' To Pimp a Butterfly '' ) , the song explodes . But it does n’t stop there . FlyLo shows off his talent by shifting gears post-Kendrick verse the only way you can : insane keys , double-time bass drum , and unrelenting hand claps . Eventually , it ’s all swallowed up in massive swelling synth and choral hums , fading to a beautiful , passionate outro . " Directed by Hiro Murai , the video begins at a funeral ( including attendees Flying Lotus and Thundercat in cameo roles ) . Seemingly a sad video , it turns instantly joyful when the two late children - a boy and a girl - bound out of their caskets at the front of the church and dance gleefully down the aisle . The mourners ca n't see the children as they dance right out of the church and out onto a blacktop , but a group of other kids chases after them as they hop in a hearse and drive away . The clip was featured by several publications on their year-end list of best videos , including '' Pitchfork '' , '' Spin '' , and Stereogumwith the latter listing it at number one . The video received two nominations at the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards : Best Choreography and Best Cinematography , ultimately winning the latter

The Royal Italian Army , although outnumbering the German soldiers three to one , was leaderless , poorly equipped , and in chaos . After a failed resistance at the Pyramid of Cestius by remaining loyalist soldiers , carabinieri ( including a school of cadets ) , and civilians , the Germans occupied Rome . They announced the imposition of German military law with summary execution for violators . Three days later ( on 12 September ) , Nazi commandos tracked down and rescued Mussolini from his hidden prison in the Gran Sasso and set him up in the puppet regime of the so-called " Republic of Salò " in Northern Italy . In October they rounded up and deported the Jews of Rome for extermination at Auschwitz and also made numerous mass roundups of non-Jewish male civilians for forced labor . Meanwhile , General Mark Clark 's Fifth Army in Salerno suffered severe setbacks , and General Eisenhower and other Allied leaders began concentrating their attention on the imminent invasion of France , temporarily neglecting Italy

Famine , alongside tax increases , widespread military desertions , a declining relief system , and natural disasters such as flooding and inability of the government to properly manage irrigation and flood-control projects caused widespread loss of life and normal civility . The central government , starved of resources , could do very little to mitigate the effects of these calamities . Making matters worse , a widespread epidemic spread across China from Zhejiang to Henan , killing an unknown but large number of people . The deadliest earthquake of all time , the Shaanxi earthquake of 1556 , occurred during the Jiajing Emperor 's reign , killing approximately 830,000 people

                CONTEXT=Betrayal is the secondary theme of '' The Wild Bunch '' . The characters suffer from their knowledge of having betrayed a friend and left him to his fate , thus violating their own honor code when it suits them ( " $ 10,000 cuts an awful lot of family ties " ) . However , Bishop says , " When you side with a man , you stay with him , and if you ca n't do that you 're like some animal . " Such oppositional ideas lead to the film 's violent conclusion , as the remaining men find their abandonment of Angel intolerable . Bishop remembers his betrayals , most notably when he deserts Deke Thornton ( in flashback ) when the law catches up to them and when he abandons Crazy Lee at the railroad office after the robbery ( ostensibly to guard the hostages ) . Critic David Weddle writes that , " like that of Conrad 's '' Lord Jim '' , Pike Bishop 's heroism is propelled by overwhelming guilt and a despairing death wish . " Vincent Canby began his review by calling the film " very beautiful and the first truly interesting American-made Western in years . It 's also so full of violence — of an intensity that can hardly be supported by the story — that it 's going to prompt a lot of people who do not know the real effect of movie violence ( as I do not ) to write automatic condemnations of it . " He observed , " Although the movie 's conventional and poetic action sequences are extraordinarily good and its landscapes beautifully photographed ... it is most interesting in its almost jolly account of chaos , corruption , and defeat " . About the actors , he commented particularly on William Holden : " After years of giving bored performances in boring movies , Holden comes back gallantly in '' The Wild Bunch '' . He looks older and tired , but he has style , both as a man and as a movie character who persists in doing what he 's always done , not because he really wants the money but because there 's simply nothing else to do . " '' TIME '' also liked Holden 's performance , describing it as his best since '' Stalag 17 '' ( a 1953 film that earned Holden an Oscar ) , noting Robert Ryan gave " the screen performance of his career " , and concluding that " '' The Wild Bunch '' contains faults and mistakes " ( such as flashbacks " introduced with surprising clumsiness " ) , but " its accomplishments are more than sufficient to confirm that Peckinpah , along with Stanley Kubrick and Arthur Penn , belongs with the best of the newer generation of American filmmakers . " In a 2002 retrospective Roger Ebert , who " saw the original version at the world premiere in 1969 , during the golden age of the junket , when Warner Bros. screened five of its new films in the Bahamas for 450 critics and reporters " , said that back then he had publicly declared the film a masterpiece during the junket 's press conference , prompted by comments from " a reporter from the '' Reader 's Digest '' who got up to ask ' Why was this film ever made ? ' " He compared the film to '' Pulp Fiction '' : " praised and condemned with equal vehemence . " " What '' Citizen Kane '' was to movie lovers in 1941 , '' The Wild Bunch '' was to cineastes in 1969 , " wrote film critic Michael Sragow , who added that Peckinpah had " produced an American movie that equals or surpasses the best of Kurosawa : the Gotterdammerung of Westerns "

Based on a short story by Stephen Vincent Benét , the film 's music is by Saul Chaplin and Gene de Paul , with lyrics by Johnny Mercer and choreography by Michael Kidd . Jane Powell plays Milly , an 1850s frontierswoman who marries Adam ( Howard Keel ) only hours after meeting him . When she returns with Adam to his log cabin in the Oregon backwoods , Milly discovers that her husband 's six brothers are uncivilized and oafish . She makes it her mission to domesticate them and , upon Milly 's sarcastic suggestion , the brothers kidnap six women from a neighboring town to marry them . The film was shot in the new CinemaScope format and is remembered for its dance sequences , particularly the " barn raising scene " in which architecture and construction become acrobatic ballet steps . '' Seven Brides for Seven Brothers '' was one of the highest-grossing films of 1954 and appeared on many critics ' 10 Best Films lists . It was nominated for five Academy Awards , including Best Picture and Best Music ( Scoring of a Musical Picture ) , which it won . Its success was a surprise to MGM , which invested more money in two other musicals : '' Rose Marie '' and '' Brigadoon '' , starring Kelly . '' Seven Brides for Seven Brothers '' was more profitable than either of the other films , as well as '' On the Town '' and '' Singin ' in the Rain '' , and its success was a major turning point for Donen 's career . The film was later criticized by novelist Francine Prose , who described it as anti-woman , calling it " one of the most repulsive movies about men and women that has ever been made " and a musical about rape

In the second , Kim Coolzip presents a seductive commercial for liquid meat , which segues into her appearance on a charity fund-raising telethon . The third is the game show , in which Skip Coolzip " gives back " to Native Americans his family 's car , then his father 's squad car ( " the black screamer " ) , and finally , " everything . " He is also assigned , with his sister , to take over the Academy Awards celebration " with these stirring words : ' Eat flaming death , fascist media pigs . ' " The second side of the album , " We 've Lost Our Big Kabloona " , culminates in the hostage situation , on stage during the live broadcast of the Academy Awards . While accepting an award for a police/family drama called " Squat ! , " which stars their parents and seems identical to the show on the first side of the album , Skip and Kim Coolzip reveal a gun . They demand that the President of the United States appear in Hollywood " with a plane full of cash and all those broken treaties , " or they will shoot the nominees one by one in alphabetical order .

                CONTEXT=Betrayal is the secondary theme of '' The Wild Bunch '' . The characters suffer from their knowledge of having betrayed a friend and left him to his fate , thus violating their own honor code when it suits them ( " $ 10,000 cuts an awful lot of family ties " ) . However , Bishop says , " When you side with a man , you stay with him , and if you ca n't do that you 're like some animal . " Such oppositional ideas lead to the film 's violent conclusion , as the remaining men find their abandonment of Angel intolerable . Bishop remembers his betrayals , most notably when he deserts Deke Thornton ( in flashback ) when the law catches up to them and when he abandons Crazy Lee at the railroad office after the robbery ( ostensibly to guard the hostages ) . Critic David Weddle writes that , " like that of Conrad 's '' Lord Jim '' , Pike Bishop 's heroism is propelled by overwhelming guilt and a despairing death wish . " Vincent Canby began his review by calling the film " very beautiful and the first truly interesting American-made Western in years . It 's also so full of violence — of an intensity that can hardly be supported by the story — that it 's going to prompt a lot of people who do not know the real effect of movie violence ( as I do not ) to write automatic condemnations of it . " He observed , " Although the movie 's conventional and poetic action sequences are extraordinarily good and its landscapes beautifully photographed ... it is most interesting in its almost jolly account of chaos , corruption , and defeat " . About the actors , he commented particularly on William Holden : " After years of giving bored performances in boring movies , Holden comes back gallantly in '' The Wild Bunch '' . He looks older and tired , but he has style , both as a man and as a movie character who persists in doing what he 's always done , not because he really wants the money but because there 's simply nothing else to do . " '' TIME '' also liked Holden 's performance , describing it as his best since '' Stalag 17 '' ( a 1953 film that earned Holden an Oscar ) , noting Robert Ryan gave " the screen performance of his career " , and concluding that " '' The Wild Bunch '' contains faults and mistakes " ( such as flashbacks " introduced with surprising clumsiness " ) , but " its accomplishments are more than sufficient to confirm that Peckinpah , along with Stanley Kubrick and Arthur Penn , belongs with the best of the newer generation of American filmmakers . " In a 2002 retrospective Roger Ebert , who " saw the original version at the world premiere in 1969 , during the golden age of the junket , when Warner Bros. screened five of its new films in the Bahamas for 450 critics and reporters " , said that back then he had publicly declared the film a masterpiece during the junket 's press conference , prompted by comments from " a reporter from the '' Reader 's Digest '' who got up to ask ' Why was this film ever made ? ' " He compared the film to '' Pulp Fiction '' : " praised and condemned with equal vehemence . " " What '' Citizen Kane '' was to movie lovers in 1941 , '' The Wild Bunch '' was to cineastes in 1969 , " wrote film critic Michael Sragow , who added that Peckinpah had " produced an American movie that equals or surpasses the best of Kurosawa : the Gotterdammerung of Westerns "

Its 14 minutes consisted of a number of scenes depicting Tate filming '' Eye of the Devil '' , dancing in nightclubs , and sightseeing around London , and also contained a brief interview with her . Asked about her acting ambitions , she replied , " I do n't fool myself . I ca n't see myself doing Shakespeare . " She spoke of her hopes of finding a niche in comedy , and in other interviews she expressed her desire to become " a light comedienne in the Carole Lombard style " . She discussed the type of contemporary actress she wanted to emulate and explained that there were two in particular that she was influenced by : Faye Dunaway and Catherine Deneuve . Of the latter , she said , " I 'd like to be an American Catherine Deneuve . She plays beautiful , sensitive , deep parts with a little bit of intelligence behind them . " Later in the year , '' Valley of the Dolls '' opened to almost uniformly negative reviews . Bosley Crowther wrote in '' The New York Times '' , " all a fairly respectful admirer of movies can do is laugh at it and turn away " . '' Newsweek '' said that the film " has no more sense of its own ludicrousness than a village idiot stumbling in manure " , but a later article read : " Astoundingly photogenic , infinitely curvaceous , Sharon Tate is one of the most smashing young things to hit Hollywood in a long time . " The three lead actresses were castigated in numerous publications , including '' The Saturday Review '' , which wrote , " Ten years ago ... Parkins , Duke , and Tate would more likely have been playing the hat check girls than movie-queens ; they are totally lacking in style , authority , or charm . " '' The Hollywood Reporter '' provided some positive comments , such as , " Sharon Tate emerges as the film 's most sympathetic character ... William H. Daniels ' photographic caress of her faultless face and enormous absorbent eyes is stunning . " Roger Ebert of the '' Chicago Sun-Times '' praised Tate as " a wonder to behold " , but after describing the dialogue in one scene as " the most offensive and appalling vulgarity ever thrown up by any civilization " , concluded that , " I will be unable to take her any more seriously as a sex symbol than Raquel Welch . " In late 1967 , Tate and Polanski returned to London and were frequent subjects of newspaper and magazine articles . Tate was depicted as being untraditional and modern , and was quoted as saying couples should live together before marrying . They were married in Chelsea , London , on January 20 , 1968 , with considerable publicity . Polanski was dressed in what the press described as " Edwardian finery " , while Tate was attired in a white minidress . The couple moved into Polanski 's mews house off Eaton Square in Belgravia , London . Photographer Peter Evans later described them as " the imperfect couple . They were the Douglas Fairbanks/Mary Pickford of our time ... Cool , nomadic , talented , and nicely shocking . " While Tate reportedly wanted a traditional marriage , Polanski remained somewhat promiscuous and described Tate 's attitude to his infidelity as " Sharon 's big hang-up " . He reminded Tate that she had promised that she would not try to change him . Tate accepted Polanski 's conditions , though she confided to friends that she hoped he would change . Peter Evans quoted Tate as saying , " We have a good arrangement . Roman lies to me and I pretend to believe him . " Polanski urged Tate to end her association with Martin Ransohoff , and Tate began to place less importance on her career until Polanski told her he wanted to be married to " a hippie , not a housewife . " The couple returned to Los Angeles and quickly became part of a social group that included some of the most successful young people in the film industry , including Warren Beatty , Jacqueline Bisset , Leslie Caron , Joan Collins , Mia Farrow , Jane Fonda , Peter Fonda , Laurence Harvey , Steve McQueen , Joanna Pettet and Peter Sellers ; older film stars like Yul Brynner , Kirk Douglas , Henry Fonda and Danny Kaye ; musicians such as Jim Morrison and The Mamas & the Papas ; and record producer Terry Melcher and his girlfriend , actress Candice Bergen . Jay Sebring remained one of the couple 's more frequent companions . Polanski 's circle of friends included people he had known since his youth in Poland such as Wojciech Frykowski and Frykowski 's girlfriend , coffee heiress Abigail Folger . Tate and Polanski moved into the Chateau Marmont Hotel in Los Angeles for a few months until they arranged to lease Patty Duke 's home on Summit Ridge Drive in Beverly Hills during the latter part of 1968 . The Polanski house was often full of strangers , and Tate regarded the casual atmosphere as part of the " free spirit " of the times , saying that she did not mind who came into her home as her motto was " live and let live . " Her close friend Leslie Caron later commented that the Polanskis were too trusting — " to the point of recklessness " — and that she had been alarmed by it

                CONTEXT=Donen solidified his solo career and scored another hit with the musical '' Seven Brides for Seven Brothers '' ( 1954 ) . Based on a short story by Stephen Vincent Benét , the film 's music is by Saul Chaplin and Gene de Paul , with lyrics by Johnny Mercer and choreography by Michael Kidd . Jane Powell plays Milly , an 1850s frontierswoman who marries Adam ( Howard Keel ) only hours after meeting him . When she returns with Adam to his log cabin in the Oregon backwoods , Milly discovers that her husband 's six brothers are uncivilized and oafish . She makes it her mission to domesticate them and , upon Milly 's sarcastic suggestion , the brothers kidnap six women from a neighboring town to marry them . The film was shot in the new CinemaScope format and is remembered for its dance sequences , particularly the " barn raising scene " in which architecture and construction become acrobatic ballet steps . '' Seven Brides for Seven Brothers '' was one of the highest-grossing films of 1954 and appeared on many critics ' 10 Best Films lists . It was nominated for five Academy Awards , including Best Picture and Best Music ( Scoring of a Musical Picture ) , which it won . Its success was a surprise to MGM , which invested more money in two other musicals : '' Rose Marie '' and '' Brigadoon '' , starring Kelly . '' Seven Brides for Seven Brothers '' was more profitable than either of the other films , as well as '' On the Town '' and '' Singin ' in the Rain '' , and its success was a major turning point for Donen 's career . The film was later criticized by novelist Francine Prose , who described it as anti-woman , calling it " one of the most repulsive movies about men and women that has ever been made " and a musical about rape

                CONTEXT=Crop Over is a traditional harvest festival which began in Barbados , having had its early beginnings on the sugar cane plantations during slavery . The original crop - over tradition began in 1687 as a way to mark the end of the yearly harvest , but was wide - spread throughout the region at the time , including in St. Vincent , Trinidad and Jamaica . As such , it still shares similarities with Carnival in Brazil and Trinidad . Many crop - over celebrations were organized and sponsored by planters , who used gifts of food and liquor as a means of reenforcing and excusing the continued enslavement of their labour force . However , slaves would also have often unsanctioned fetes that featured singing , dancing and accompaniment by bottles filled with water , shak - shak , banjo , triangle , fiddle , guitar , and bones that were more in keeping with their ancestral culture . Other traditions that were later added included climbing a greased pole , feasting and drinking competitions . However , with the harsh effects of World War II on Barbados , these annual celebrations came to an end . The Crop Over Festival was first launched on June 1 , 1970 , but was not officially called a festival until 4 years later .

It occurred in the AFC divisional playoff game of the National Football League ( NFL ) , between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Oakland Raiders at Three Rivers Stadium in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , on December 23 , 1972 . With the Steelers trailing in the last 30 seconds of the game , Pittsburgh quarterback Terry Bradshaw threw a pass attempt to John Fuqua . The ball either bounced off the helmet of Raiders safety Jack Tatum or off the hands of Fuqua , and , as it fell , Steelers fullback Franco Harris scooped it up and ran for a game - winning touchdown . The play has been a source of unresolved controversy and speculation ever since , as many people have contended that the ball only touched Fuqua or that it hit the ground before Harris caught it , either of which would have resulted in an incomplete pass by the rules at the time . Kevin Cook 's The Last Headbangers cites the play as the beginning of a bitter rivalry between Pittsburgh and Oakland that fueled a historically brutal Raiders team during the NFL 's most controversially physical era .

" Meanwhile , Frank Scheck of '' The Hollywood Reporter '' commented that " Mastroianni provides a vividly intense turn in the title role , but the film 's narrative diffuseness and excessive stylization defeats her best efforts . " He called it " a misstep from one of that country 's most acclaimed filmmakers . " At the 35th César Awards , Alex Beaupain was nominated for the Best Original Music award

                CONTEXT=Betrayal is the secondary theme of '' The Wild Bunch '' . The characters suffer from their knowledge of having betrayed a friend and left him to his fate , thus violating their own honor code when it suits them ( " $ 10,000 cuts an awful lot of family ties " ) . However , Bishop says , " When you side with a man , you stay with him , and if you ca n't do that you 're like some animal . " Such oppositional ideas lead to the film 's violent conclusion , as the remaining men find their abandonment of Angel intolerable . Bishop remembers his betrayals , most notably when he deserts Deke Thornton ( in flashback ) when the law catches up to them and when he abandons Crazy Lee at the railroad office after the robbery ( ostensibly to guard the hostages ) . Critic David Weddle writes that , " like that of Conrad 's '' Lord Jim '' , Pike Bishop 's heroism is propelled by overwhelming guilt and a despairing death wish . " Vincent Canby began his review by calling the film " very beautiful and the first truly interesting American-made Western in years . It 's also so full of violence — of an intensity that can hardly be supported by the story — that it 's going to prompt a lot of people who do not know the real effect of movie violence ( as I do not ) to write automatic condemnations of it . " He observed , " Although the movie 's conventional and poetic action sequences are extraordinarily good and its landscapes beautifully photographed ... it is most interesting in its almost jolly account of chaos , corruption , and defeat " . About the actors , he commented particularly on William Holden : " After years of giving bored performances in boring movies , Holden comes back gallantly in '' The Wild Bunch '' . He looks older and tired , but he has style , both as a man and as a movie character who persists in doing what he 's always done , not because he really wants the money but because there 's simply nothing else to do . " '' TIME '' also liked Holden 's performance , describing it as his best since '' Stalag 17 '' ( a 1953 film that earned Holden an Oscar ) , noting Robert Ryan gave " the screen performance of his career " , and concluding that " '' The Wild Bunch '' contains faults and mistakes " ( such as flashbacks " introduced with surprising clumsiness " ) , but " its accomplishments are more than sufficient to confirm that Peckinpah , along with Stanley Kubrick and Arthur Penn , belongs with the best of the newer generation of American filmmakers . " In a 2002 retrospective Roger Ebert , who " saw the original version at the world premiere in 1969 , during the golden age of the junket , when Warner Bros. screened five of its new films in the Bahamas for 450 critics and reporters " , said that back then he had publicly declared the film a masterpiece during the junket 's press conference , prompted by comments from " a reporter from the '' Reader 's Digest '' who got up to ask ' Why was this film ever made ? ' " He compared the film to '' Pulp Fiction '' : " praised and condemned with equal vehemence . " " What '' Citizen Kane '' was to movie lovers in 1941 , '' The Wild Bunch '' was to cineastes in 1969 , " wrote film critic Michael Sragow , who added that Peckinpah had " produced an American movie that equals or surpasses the best of Kurosawa : the Gotterdammerung of Westerns "

                CONTEXT=In the aftermath of the battle over the national bank , Jackson 's political opponents coalesced into the Whig Party . By taking a name rooted in American and British history , the Whigs implicitly criticized Jackson as a tyrannical executive . Although National Republicans like Clay and Webster formed the core of the Whig Party , Anti-Masonic leaders like William H. Seward and states ' rights Democrats like John Tyler also joined the new party . The Whig Party proved more durable than the National Republican Party and , along with the Democrats , the Whigs became one of the two major parties of the Second Party System , which would extend into the 1850s . By 1834 , Webster supporters such as Caleb Cushing , Rufus Choate , Abbott Lawrence , and Edward Everett had begun preparing for his candidacy in the 1836 presidential election . With Clay showing no indication of making another run , Webster hoped to become the main Whig candidate in the 1836 election , but General William Henry Harrison and Senator Hugh Lawson White retained strong support in the West and the South , respectively . Rather than uniting behind one presidential candidate , Whig leaders settled on a strategy of running multiple candidates in order to force a contingent election in the House of Representatives . Webster was nominated for president by the Massachusetts legislature , but Harrison won the backing of most Whigs outside of the South . Although Webster had a far greater reputation as a national figure than Harrison , many Whigs hoped that Harrison 's military record would allow him to replicate Jackson 's 1832 victory . Webster 's chances also suffered from his lingering association with the Federalist Party , his close relationship with elite politicians and businessmen , and his lack of appeal among the broad populace ; Remini writes that the American public " admired and revered him but did not love or trust him . " With little support outside of his home state , Webster attempted to withdraw his presidential candidacy , but , to his eventual regret , Massachusetts Whig leaders convinced him to stay in the race . Meanwhile , the 1835 Democratic National Convention nominated Van Buren , Jackson 's preferred successor , for president . In the 1836 election , Van Buren won a majority of the popular and electoral vote , Harrison finished a distant second , and White carried two Southern states . Webster won only the electoral votes of Massachusetts . Adding to his displeasure , Webster lost a major Supreme Court decision , '' Charles River Bridge v. Warren Bridge '' , shortly after the election

Their début album Usurper of the Sun Rays was self - released on an MC - cassette in 1993 . It presented a very particular brew that incorporated elements of heavy and at the same time psychedelic music based on sound experimentation . It was hypnotic , heavy and sophisticated . In 1994 , the group might have split , but two musicians of a respected mainstream heavy - metal outfit — Soma — made the band live on . Same year the MDP recorded at Asparez studio their first prog - suite — the River — which today is mentioned in all anthologies of Armenian rock . Next few years the band spent in Russia and released their another album , Take Your Nibbled Apple Back , which boasted eerie vocal experimentations with female vocals . In 2002 , the MDP recorded a very unexpected single , " Falling in Love / Should I " , which incorporated trip - hop elements , but this was short - lived , since the reviews in British and American press would stress that they are particularly great at playing heavier stuff than Portishead / Sylvian moods . Upon opening its own studio , in 2003 and 2004 , MDP produced a range of events themselves : festivals MindPower , concerts and gigs for other popular Armenian rock - bands . They again play very heavy music , close to sympho - rock , though it is always difficult to describe their music . Recent reviews from OverHook Music tell that they have stylistic resemblance with Dream Theatre , while others recommend to remember Mars Volta . They deservedly attracted attention of German independent promoters and concerted in Dresden in 2005 . Now the band also stands as producer of numerous rock - concerts and rock - festivals in Armenia . Vibrographus Studio , headed by band members , boasts the best hardware in Yerevan for production of rock events . One of the band 's 2008 offspring is the Dogma project , which features female vocals augmented with the band 's bass and guitar .

Thirteen other prominent Christian and Jewish women , including the social worker Belle Moskowitz , made up the Society 's first Board of Directors . The Travelers Aid Society 's purpose was to provide social work to women traveling alone in order to protect them from moral danger . The TAS - NY believed that the greatest threat to female travelers in the early twentieth century was white slave trafficking , defined as the coercion of " white " women into prostitution and their subsequent sale to procurers or male clients . Agents of the Travelers Aid Society patrolled Grand Central Terminal and Pennsylvania Station , as well as the city 's piers where transatlantic ocean liners docked , looking for women who they identified as vulnerable . Services usually entailed safely escorting women , immigrant and native - born alike , to city addresses , other transportation lines , or to a temporary lodging home , such as the YWCA . The TAS - NY 's first headquarters was a four - story row house located a short walk from Grand Central Terminal at 238 East 48th St in the Turtle Bay neighborhood .

                CONTEXT=The Hat is a children 's book written and illustrated by French artist and author Tomi Ungerer . Published in 1970 by Parents ' Magazine Press , the book tells the story of a penniless Army veteran , Benito Badoglio , who becomes rich after he unwittingly gains possession of a magic flying top hat . The book is richly illustrated and the text contains numerous vivid and mellifluous descriptions and dialog . For example , upon meeting the top hat , the protagonist cries , " Thunder of Sebastopole ! " ; in another scene , he shouts , " A thousand Potemkins ! " Other characters in the book are " cutthroats " , " brigands " , a " fainting contessa " , and a " dashing cadet " . The author 's interest in such colorful prose was explained by Selma G. Lanes in the Atlantic Monthly : " Ungerer feels strongly that children enjoy unfamiliar words and euphonious , mystifying phrases . " The setting for The Hat is nineteenth century Italy , and was described by Sydney D. Long in the Horn Book Magazine as " a never - never land ... , the comic - opera pictures of The Hat are full of mandolin - playing musicians , splashing fountains , and apple - cheeked peasant lasses .

                GOLD_MENTION=1835 Democratic National Convention
                CONTEXT=In the aftermath of the battle over the national bank , Jackson 's political opponents coalesced into the Whig Party . By taking a name rooted in American and British history , the Whigs implicitly criticized Jackson as a tyrannical executive . Although National Republicans like Clay and Webster formed the core of the Whig Party , Anti-Masonic leaders like William H. Seward and states ' rights Democrats like John Tyler also joined the new party . The Whig Party proved more durable than the National Republican Party and , along with the Democrats , the Whigs became one of the two major parties of the Second Party System , which would extend into the 1850s . By 1834 , Webster supporters such as Caleb Cushing , Rufus Choate , Abbott Lawrence , and Edward Everett had begun preparing for his candidacy in the 1836 presidential election . With Clay showing no indication of making another run , Webster hoped to become the main Whig candidate in the 1836 election , but General William Henry Harrison and Senator Hugh Lawson White retained strong support in the West and the South , respectively . Rather than uniting behind one presidential candidate , Whig leaders settled on a strategy of running multiple candidates in order to force a contingent election in the House of Representatives . Webster was nominated for president by the Massachusetts legislature , but Harrison won the backing of most Whigs outside of the South . Although Webster had a far greater reputation as a national figure than Harrison , many Whigs hoped that Harrison 's military record would allow him to replicate Jackson 's 1832 victory . Webster 's chances also suffered from his lingering association with the Federalist Party , his close relationship with elite politicians and businessmen , and his lack of appeal among the broad populace ; Remini writes that the American public " admired and revered him but did not love or trust him . " With little support outside of his home state , Webster attempted to withdraw his presidential candidacy , but , to his eventual regret , Massachusetts Whig leaders convinced him to stay in the race . Meanwhile , the 1835 Democratic National Convention nominated Van Buren , Jackson 's preferred successor , for president . In the 1836 election , Van Buren won a majority of the popular and electoral vote , Harrison finished a distant second , and White carried two Southern states . Webster won only the electoral votes of Massachusetts . Adding to his displeasure , Webster lost a major Supreme Court decision , '' Charles River Bridge v. Warren Bridge '' , shortly after the election

Named Best New Track by '' Pitchfork Media '' , editor Jayson Greene praised Lamar 's performance , writing " his hyper-vaulting flow and embedded rhyme patterns within rhyme patterns " . For its year-end list of " The 100 Best Tracks of 2014 " , '' Pitchfork '' ranked the song at number 23 . Also commenting on Lamar , '' Billboard '' 's Chris Payne wrote , " There are n't many A-list rappers who could handle a beat like this , but Kendrick is clearly one of them . " '' Rolling Stone '' editor Jon Dolan gave the song three-and-a-half out of five stars , commenting " Over offhandedly lovely , warp-speed psychedelic soul-jazz , Lamar unleashes a word-mad waterfall with a worried emotional core ( " analyze my demise I say I 'm super-anxious " , he raps ) . " '' Consequence of Sound '' editor Nina Corcoran wrote : " when combined with one of Lamar ’s hottest verses to date ( before '' To Pimp a Butterfly '' ) , the song explodes . But it does n’t stop there . FlyLo shows off his talent by shifting gears post-Kendrick verse the only way you can : insane keys , double-time bass drum , and unrelenting hand claps . Eventually , it ’s all swallowed up in massive swelling synth and choral hums , fading to a beautiful , passionate outro . " Directed by Hiro Murai , the video begins at a funeral ( including attendees Flying Lotus and Thundercat in cameo roles ) . Seemingly a sad video , it turns instantly joyful when the two late children - a boy and a girl - bound out of their caskets at the front of the church and dance gleefully down the aisle . The mourners ca n't see the children as they dance right out of the church and out onto a blacktop , but a group of other kids chases after them as they hop in a hearse and drive away . The clip was featured by several publications on their year-end list of best videos , including '' Pitchfork '' , '' Spin '' , and Stereogumwith the latter listing it at number one . The video received two nominations at the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards : Best Choreography and Best Cinematography , ultimately winning the latter

                CONTEXT=On January 27 , 2011 the festival sent 9 filmmakers to 9 cities across the US to screen and discuss their films . The cities and films included : Bob Tourtellotte of Reuters wrote " Sundance 2011 has proven to be exceptionally strong , audiences and filmmakers seem to agree . " Tourtellotte reported that Robert Redford said that three years ago the Sundance Institute " set out to get back to its roots of supporting alternative voices in cinema and he felt like this year that strategy paid off . " Redford said " This year , what has excited me , is I think the quality is increasing in diversity and is increasing in depth . " The AP reported that Redford said it 's " always a relief " when the festival ends because " it 's really exhausting . " Kenneth Turan , film critic for the '' Los Angeles Times '' , wrote " though the festival has gotten ever bigger — and ( thankfully ) more efficient in moving its close to 50,000 attendees in and out of its far-flung theaters — it still retains the scrappy , antic spirit that has animated it from the start . " Turan wrote " One of the paradoxes of Sundance is that the quirkiness and charm around the edges of the festival are not always fully appreciated because so much of the media focus is on the premieres section and the U.S. dramatic competition " which he said " are , frankly , often the weakest parts of the festival . " Turan said " Sundance 's insistence on giving equal weight to documentaries and dramas has made it into as important a nonfiction showcase as any festival in the world ; witness the fact that four out of the five Oscar-nominated docs this year debuted at Sundance last January . " He also wrote that the foreign language film competition " is a strength at Sundance , and yet that field is given even less popular attention than the documentaries . " Peter Knegt wrote that this year 's festival " probably wo n't replicate last year 's Oscar record . " He said " Despite a huge surge in sales , this year 's Sundance slate looks like it might be the least Oscar-friendly in some time . " He noted that the U.S. Dramatic Grand Jury Prize winners have been nominated for Best Picture for two years ( referring to '' Precious '' and '' Winter 's Bone '' ) . Knegt speculated on films that might be nominated for the Oscars . Films he deemed " most likely to succeed " at being nominated included : '' Like Crazy '' for Best Picture , Michael Shannon of '' Take Shelter '' for Best Actor , Elizabeth Olsen of '' Martha Marcy May Marlene '' for Best Actress , Felicity Jones of '' Like Crazy '' for Best Actress , Jessica Chastain of '' Take Shelter '' for Best Supporting Actress , '' Project Nim '' for Best Documentary Feature , '' Page One '' for Best Documentary Feature , and '' The Interrupters '' for Best Documentary Feature . He wrote " It 's reasonable to feel assured that at least one of Sundance 's docs will end up an Oscar nominee , if not two , three or four . " Jada Yuan of '' New York '' magazine wrote " perhaps the biggest highlight of the festival is just how ripe it 's been for acquisitions , with nearly 30 films getting picked up , the most at any Sundance ever . " On " why everyone is suddenly so bullish on independent film " , Owen Gleiberman wrote that the " energy and optimism at Sundance this year was n't just hype . " He said the factors he thought were driving a new evolving vision of the indie film world included : " The deals have n’t gotten cheaper — they 've gotten smarter " , a belief that last year 's new festival director John Cooper and director of programming Trevor Groth " have re-energized the festival , heightening its quality and organizing the movies with a tempting new shape and vision " , video on demand gives distributors a safety net and more confidence , and the audiences for Sundance movies are not going away , saying " The Oscars ... have become a testament to the central place that Sundance movies now occupy . " Redford was happy about the success of the festival , with about 45 films being sold vs 14 in 2010 , an increase of about 220 % . Redford said studios are realizing " there are audiences " for indie films

                CONTEXT=The Los Angeles Lakers are an American professional basketball team based in Los Angeles , California . They play in the Pacific Division of the Western Conference in the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) . The Lakers ' franchise was founded in 1947 in Detroit , Michigan before moving to Minneapolis , Minnesota , where the team got its official title from the state 's nickname , " Land of 10,000 Lakes " . The Minneapolis Lakers won five NBA Finals before relocating to Los Angeles in the 1960 – 61 NBA season , becoming the first West Coast team in league history . In the 1960s , the Lakers reached the NBA Finals six times , but lost every series to the Boston Celtics , beginning their long and storied rivalry . In 1972 , with future Hall of Famers Wilt Chamberlain , Gail Goodrich , and Jerry West , the Lakers compiled a 33 - game winning streak , the longest streak in U.S. professional team sports , and won their sixth title under coach Bill Sharman . The Lakers ' popularity soared in the 1980s when they won five additional championships during a nine - year span with the help of Hall of Famers Magic Johnson , Kareem Abdul - Jabbar , James Worthy and coach Pat Riley , the franchise 's all - time leader in both regular season and playoff games coached and wins .

                CONTEXT=The '' All Eyes on Sharon Tate '' documentary was used to publicize the film . Its 14 minutes consisted of a number of scenes depicting Tate filming '' Eye of the Devil '' , dancing in nightclubs , and sightseeing around London , and also contained a brief interview with her . Asked about her acting ambitions , she replied , " I do n't fool myself . I ca n't see myself doing Shakespeare . " She spoke of her hopes of finding a niche in comedy , and in other interviews she expressed her desire to become " a light comedienne in the Carole Lombard style " . She discussed the type of contemporary actress she wanted to emulate and explained that there were two in particular that she was influenced by : Faye Dunaway and Catherine Deneuve . Of the latter , she said , " I 'd like to be an American Catherine Deneuve . She plays beautiful , sensitive , deep parts with a little bit of intelligence behind them . " Later in the year , '' Valley of the Dolls '' opened to almost uniformly negative reviews . Bosley Crowther wrote in '' The New York Times '' , " all a fairly respectful admirer of movies can do is laugh at it and turn away " . '' Newsweek '' said that the film " has no more sense of its own ludicrousness than a village idiot stumbling in manure " , but a later article read : " Astoundingly photogenic , infinitely curvaceous , Sharon Tate is one of the most smashing young things to hit Hollywood in a long time . " The three lead actresses were castigated in numerous publications , including '' The Saturday Review '' , which wrote , " Ten years ago ... Parkins , Duke , and Tate would more likely have been playing the hat check girls than movie-queens ; they are totally lacking in style , authority , or charm . " '' The Hollywood Reporter '' provided some positive comments , such as , " Sharon Tate emerges as the film 's most sympathetic character ... William H. Daniels ' photographic caress of her faultless face and enormous absorbent eyes is stunning . " Roger Ebert of the '' Chicago Sun-Times '' praised Tate as " a wonder to behold " , but after describing the dialogue in one scene as " the most offensive and appalling vulgarity ever thrown up by any civilization " , concluded that , " I will be unable to take her any more seriously as a sex symbol than Raquel Welch . " In late 1967 , Tate and Polanski returned to London and were frequent subjects of newspaper and magazine articles . Tate was depicted as being untraditional and modern , and was quoted as saying couples should live together before marrying . They were married in Chelsea , London , on January 20 , 1968 , with considerable publicity . Polanski was dressed in what the press described as " Edwardian finery " , while Tate was attired in a white minidress . The couple moved into Polanski 's mews house off Eaton Square in Belgravia , London . Photographer Peter Evans later described them as " the imperfect couple . They were the Douglas Fairbanks/Mary Pickford of our time ... Cool , nomadic , talented , and nicely shocking . " While Tate reportedly wanted a traditional marriage , Polanski remained somewhat promiscuous and described Tate 's attitude to his infidelity as " Sharon 's big hang-up " . He reminded Tate that she had promised that she would not try to change him . Tate accepted Polanski 's conditions , though she confided to friends that she hoped he would change . Peter Evans quoted Tate as saying , " We have a good arrangement . Roman lies to me and I pretend to believe him . " Polanski urged Tate to end her association with Martin Ransohoff , and Tate began to place less importance on her career until Polanski told her he wanted to be married to " a hippie , not a housewife . " The couple returned to Los Angeles and quickly became part of a social group that included some of the most successful young people in the film industry , including Warren Beatty , Jacqueline Bisset , Leslie Caron , Joan Collins , Mia Farrow , Jane Fonda , Peter Fonda , Laurence Harvey , Steve McQueen , Joanna Pettet and Peter Sellers ; older film stars like Yul Brynner , Kirk Douglas , Henry Fonda and Danny Kaye ; musicians such as Jim Morrison and The Mamas & the Papas ; and record producer Terry Melcher and his girlfriend , actress Candice Bergen . Jay Sebring remained one of the couple 's more frequent companions . Polanski 's circle of friends included people he had known since his youth in Poland such as Wojciech Frykowski and Frykowski 's girlfriend , coffee heiress Abigail Folger . Tate and Polanski moved into the Chateau Marmont Hotel in Los Angeles for a few months until they arranged to lease Patty Duke 's home on Summit Ridge Drive in Beverly Hills during the latter part of 1968 . The Polanski house was often full of strangers , and Tate regarded the casual atmosphere as part of the " free spirit " of the times , saying that she did not mind who came into her home as her motto was " live and let live . " Her close friend Leslie Caron later commented that the Polanskis were too trusting — " to the point of recklessness " — and that she had been alarmed by it

                CONTEXT=The show received a negative reception from most media publications . Associated Press television critic Frazier Moore lamented that Crystal " seemed incredibly listless " . He also questioned the purpose of the " Year of the Woman " theme writing , " The Oscar show itself seemed at odds with its own feminist theme . " Robert Bianco from the '' Pittsburgh Post-Gazette '' derided Allen 's musical production numbers , comparing them to the disastrous opening number at the 61st ceremony held in 1989 . Columnist Matt Roush of '' USA Today '' complained , " Crystal , in a by-now-familiar performance , has , in four years , taken a plum assignment and , by repetition , reduced it to shtick . " He also wrote that , " The song medley is getting old hat , " and the " smug references to his flop '' Mr. Saturday Night '' were out of an improv amateur night . " The telecast also received unfavorable reaction from various public feminist figures . In an interview with '' Los Angeles Daily News '' author and activist Betty Friedan condemned the " Year of the Woman " theme commenting , " It had no basis in reality . On behalf of women directors , cinematographer , and producers , I resent the travesty of calling that a tribute . " Likewise , President of the National Organization for Women 's Los Angeles chapter Tammy Bruce chastised ceremony 's feminist tribute as " one of the most hypocritical , patronizing things I saw in my whole life . " In response , Gil Cates responded towards the criticism of the theme stating , " The theme developed and raised consciousness in a way that I think is positive , not only for the individual in general but for individual women specifically . " He also quoted an ancient Chinese proverb later made famous by former U.S. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt saying , " It is better to light one candle than to curse the darkness " Despite the adverse reception , the ABC broadcast drew in an average of 45.7 million people over its length , which was a 3 % increase from the previous year 's ceremony . The show also drew higher Nielsen ratings compared to the previous ceremony with 31.2 % of households watching over a 51 share . It also drew a higher 18 – 49 demo rating with a 20.1 rating among viewers in that demographic

                CONTEXT=The '' All Eyes on Sharon Tate '' documentary was used to publicize the film . Its 14 minutes consisted of a number of scenes depicting Tate filming '' Eye of the Devil '' , dancing in nightclubs , and sightseeing around London , and also contained a brief interview with her . Asked about her acting ambitions , she replied , " I do n't fool myself . I ca n't see myself doing Shakespeare . " She spoke of her hopes of finding a niche in comedy , and in other interviews she expressed her desire to become " a light comedienne in the Carole Lombard style " . She discussed the type of contemporary actress she wanted to emulate and explained that there were two in particular that she was influenced by : Faye Dunaway and Catherine Deneuve . Of the latter , she said , " I 'd like to be an American Catherine Deneuve . She plays beautiful , sensitive , deep parts with a little bit of intelligence behind them . " Later in the year , '' Valley of the Dolls '' opened to almost uniformly negative reviews . Bosley Crowther wrote in '' The New York Times '' , " all a fairly respectful admirer of movies can do is laugh at it and turn away " . '' Newsweek '' said that the film " has no more sense of its own ludicrousness than a village idiot stumbling in manure " , but a later article read : " Astoundingly photogenic , infinitely curvaceous , Sharon Tate is one of the most smashing young things to hit Hollywood in a long time . " The three lead actresses were castigated in numerous publications , including '' The Saturday Review '' , which wrote , " Ten years ago ... Parkins , Duke , and Tate would more likely have been playing the hat check girls than movie-queens ; they are totally lacking in style , authority , or charm . " '' The Hollywood Reporter '' provided some positive comments , such as , " Sharon Tate emerges as the film 's most sympathetic character ... William H. Daniels ' photographic caress of her faultless face and enormous absorbent eyes is stunning . " Roger Ebert of the '' Chicago Sun-Times '' praised Tate as " a wonder to behold " , but after describing the dialogue in one scene as " the most offensive and appalling vulgarity ever thrown up by any civilization " , concluded that , " I will be unable to take her any more seriously as a sex symbol than Raquel Welch . " In late 1967 , Tate and Polanski returned to London and were frequent subjects of newspaper and magazine articles . Tate was depicted as being untraditional and modern , and was quoted as saying couples should live together before marrying . They were married in Chelsea , London , on January 20 , 1968 , with considerable publicity . Polanski was dressed in what the press described as " Edwardian finery " , while Tate was attired in a white minidress . The couple moved into Polanski 's mews house off Eaton Square in Belgravia , London . Photographer Peter Evans later described them as " the imperfect couple . They were the Douglas Fairbanks/Mary Pickford of our time ... Cool , nomadic , talented , and nicely shocking . " While Tate reportedly wanted a traditional marriage , Polanski remained somewhat promiscuous and described Tate 's attitude to his infidelity as " Sharon 's big hang-up " . He reminded Tate that she had promised that she would not try to change him . Tate accepted Polanski 's conditions , though she confided to friends that she hoped he would change . Peter Evans quoted Tate as saying , " We have a good arrangement . Roman lies to me and I pretend to believe him . " Polanski urged Tate to end her association with Martin Ransohoff , and Tate began to place less importance on her career until Polanski told her he wanted to be married to " a hippie , not a housewife . " The couple returned to Los Angeles and quickly became part of a social group that included some of the most successful young people in the film industry , including Warren Beatty , Jacqueline Bisset , Leslie Caron , Joan Collins , Mia Farrow , Jane Fonda , Peter Fonda , Laurence Harvey , Steve McQueen , Joanna Pettet and Peter Sellers ; older film stars like Yul Brynner , Kirk Douglas , Henry Fonda and Danny Kaye ; musicians such as Jim Morrison and The Mamas & the Papas ; and record producer Terry Melcher and his girlfriend , actress Candice Bergen . Jay Sebring remained one of the couple 's more frequent companions . Polanski 's circle of friends included people he had known since his youth in Poland such as Wojciech Frykowski and Frykowski 's girlfriend , coffee heiress Abigail Folger . Tate and Polanski moved into the Chateau Marmont Hotel in Los Angeles for a few months until they arranged to lease Patty Duke 's home on Summit Ridge Drive in Beverly Hills during the latter part of 1968 . The Polanski house was often full of strangers , and Tate regarded the casual atmosphere as part of the " free spirit " of the times , saying that she did not mind who came into her home as her motto was " live and let live . " Her close friend Leslie Caron later commented that the Polanskis were too trusting — " to the point of recklessness " — and that she had been alarmed by it

" By comparison , Metacritic calculated an average score of 62 out of 100 based on 22 reviews , indicating " generally favorable reviews " . J. G. Ballard gave positive feedback , and was especially impressed with Christian Bale 's performance . Critical reaction was not universally affirmative , but Richard Corliss of '' Time '' stated that Spielberg " has energized each frame with allusive legerdemain and an intelligent density of images and emotions . " Janet Maslin from '' The New York Times '' called the film " a visual splendor , a heroic adventurousness and an immense scope that make it unforgettable . " Julie Salamon of '' The Wall Street Journal '' wrote that the film as " an edgy , intelligent script by playwright Tom Stoppard , Spielberg has made an extraordinary film out of Mr. Ballard 's extraordinary war experience . " J. Hoberman from '' The Village Voice '' decried that the serious subject was undermined by Spielberg 's " shamelessly kiddiecentric " approach . Roger Ebert gave a mixed reaction , " Despite the emotional potential in the story , it did n't much move me . Maybe , like the kid , I decided that no world where you can play with airplanes can be all that bad . " On his TV show with Gene Siskel , Ebert said that the film " is basically a good idea for a film that never gets off the ground . " Siskel added , " I do n't know what the film is about . It 's so totally confused and taking things from different parts . On one hand , if it wants to say something about a child 's - eye view of war , you got a movie made by John Boorman called '' Hope and Glory '' that was just released that is much better , and much more daring in showing the whimsy that children 's view of war is . On the other hand , this film wants to hedge its bet and make it like an adventure film , so you 've got like '' Indiana Jones '' with the John Malkovich character helping the little kid through all the fun of war . I do n't know what Spielberg wanted to do . " The film won awards from the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures for Best Film and Best Director , and Bale received a special citation for Best Performance by a Juvenile Actor , the first National Board award bestowed on a child actor . At the 60th Academy Awards , '' Empire of the Sun '' was nominated for Art Direction , Cinematography , Editing , Original Music Score , Costume Design ( Bob Ringwood ) , and Sound ( Robert Knudson , Don Digirolamo , John Boyd and Tony Dawe ) . It did not convert any of the nominations into awards . Allen Daviau , who was nominated as cinematographer , publicly complained , " I ca n't second-guess the Academy , but I feel very sorry that I get nominations and Steven does n't . It 's his vision that makes it all come together , and if Steven was n't making these films , none of us would be here . " The film won awards for cinematography , sound design , and music score at the 42nd British Academy Film Awards .

Spielberg was honored for this work by the Directors Guild of America , while the American Society of Cinematographers honored Allen Daviau .

After attending a Queen concert in Los Angeles , Michael Jackson suggested to Mercury backstage that " Another One Bites the Dust " be released as a single , and in October 1980 it spent three weeks at number one .

According to review aggregator Metacritic , the album has a score of 48/100 based on 8 reviews , indicating " mixed or average reviews " . On another aggregator website , Album of the Year , it holds the 4th position on a list of worst reviewed albums of 2014 . Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic gave the album 2.5 stars out of 5 saying that " Michele is not a natural pop star . This was true in 2009 when she debuted on '' Glee '' as Rachel Berry and it 's even clearer in 2014 . " Mike Ayers from '' Billboard '' gave a mostly positive review , saying , " Lyrically , '' Louder '' is rather one-sided , as she often sings about the perils of relationships , over and over , in ways that we 've all heard many times at this point . Still , it 's a solid effort that shows she has promise as a bonafide pop artist . " Sarah Rodman of '' The Boston Globe '' gave the album a mostly positive review , writing , " The Broadway veteran puts her mighty soprano through its paces on bouncy dance tracks , soaring ballads , and midtempo pop tunes where she straddles the line , mostly comfortably , between Katy Perry and Celine Dion . " Kyle Anderson of '' Entertainment Weekly '' gave the album a B - , writing , " It 's hard to be that mad at '' Louder '' , because it 's so admirably and lovingly crafted . There 's nothing wrong with Lea Michele 's debut , and that 's its biggest problem . While well curated and exquisitely executed , '' Louder '' is missing the visceral oomph that defines the gulf between superstars and the rest of the top 40 chum . " At '' USA Today '' , Jerry Shriver rated the album 2.5 stars out of four , and stated that " softer would have been a better approach . " He added that the song " Battlefield " points to a more promising direction . Kevin McFarland of '' The A.V. Club '' gave a C - rating , writing , " '' Louder '' , Michele 's debut solo album under her own name , does feature her distinctive talent as a vocalist . But the record is caught in an unfortunate stylistic limbo between fun-loving , youthful pop and the maturity of adult contemporary artists . " Jim Farber of the '' New York Daily News '' awarded the album two stars . He criticized , " Michele does n't so much sing as trumpet like an elephant eager for the charge . Her voice has more need than vulnerability , more anger than understanding . " Christopher R. Weingarten of '' Rolling Stone '' also gave a negative review , stating , " This album of insta-dated EDM-pop anthems and half-cocked bass drops probably wo n't help Michele 's cause . The songs about love 's ups and downs have a few memorable lyrics ( ' My heart 's too drunk to drive ' ) but not nearly enough . " '' Louder '' was nominated for World 's Best Album at the 2014 World Music Awards , held in Monaco on May 27 , 2014

According to review aggregator Metacritic , the album has a score of 48/100 based on 8 reviews , indicating " mixed or average reviews " . On another aggregator website , Album of the Year , it holds the 4th position on a list of worst reviewed albums of 2014 . Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic gave the album 2.5 stars out of 5 saying that " Michele is not a natural pop star . This was true in 2009 when she debuted on '' Glee '' as Rachel Berry and it 's even clearer in 2014 . " Mike Ayers from '' Billboard '' gave a mostly positive review , saying , " Lyrically , '' Louder '' is rather one-sided , as she often sings about the perils of relationships , over and over , in ways that we 've all heard many times at this point . Still , it 's a solid effort that shows she has promise as a bonafide pop artist . " Sarah Rodman of '' The Boston Globe '' gave the album a mostly positive review , writing , " The Broadway veteran puts her mighty soprano through its paces on bouncy dance tracks , soaring ballads , and midtempo pop tunes where she straddles the line , mostly comfortably , between Katy Perry and Celine Dion . " Kyle Anderson of '' Entertainment Weekly '' gave the album a B - , writing , " It 's hard to be that mad at '' Louder '' , because it 's so admirably and lovingly crafted . There 's nothing wrong with Lea Michele 's debut , and that 's its biggest problem . While well curated and exquisitely executed , '' Louder '' is missing the visceral oomph that defines the gulf between superstars and the rest of the top 40 chum . " At '' USA Today '' , Jerry Shriver rated the album 2.5 stars out of four , and stated that " softer would have been a better approach . " He added that the song " Battlefield " points to a more promising direction . Kevin McFarland of '' The A.V. Club '' gave a C - rating , writing , " '' Louder '' , Michele 's debut solo album under her own name , does feature her distinctive talent as a vocalist . But the record is caught in an unfortunate stylistic limbo between fun-loving , youthful pop and the maturity of adult contemporary artists . " Jim Farber of the '' New York Daily News '' awarded the album two stars . He criticized , " Michele does n't so much sing as trumpet like an elephant eager for the charge . Her voice has more need than vulnerability , more anger than understanding . " Christopher R. Weingarten of '' Rolling Stone '' also gave a negative review , stating , " This album of insta-dated EDM-pop anthems and half-cocked bass drops probably wo n't help Michele 's cause . The songs about love 's ups and downs have a few memorable lyrics ( ' My heart 's too drunk to drive ' ) but not nearly enough . " '' Louder '' was nominated for World 's Best Album at the 2014 World Music Awards , held in Monaco on May 27 , 2014

Richard Harrington of '' The Washington Post '' deemed the song " a powerful exploration of exhaustion and depression . " Alex Pappademas , writing for '' Spin '' , compared the song to the music of Weezer . Katy Kroll of '' Billboard '' recognized it among her top 10 singles of 2000 , calling it " a good old-fashioned depressing song with mainstream flair . " Geoff Boucher , writing for the '' Los Angeles Times '' , called it " a poignant essay on a teen mulling over suicide " ; conversely , Steve Appleford of the '' Los Angeles Times '' dubbed it a " moving if unremarkable examination . " Scott Mervis of the '' Pittsburgh Post-Gazette '' called it a " rare departure from the usual Blink fare . " Writers for '' The A.V. Club '' listed it among other suicide-related songs in 2009 , describing it as " surprisingly affecting , especially when the band reaches the bombastic chorus , and when the song describes suicide 's crushing aftermath . " In a retrospective review , Chris Payne of '' Billboard '' wrote , " Stylistically , it 's also a Blink breakthrough : rather than putting their heads down and plowing through at breakneck speed , the band dials back the verses and interludes to let them breathe a bit . The resulting chorus achieves an arena-worthy feel not achieved anywhere else on '' Enema of the State '' . " The song caused a controversy in 2000 when it was set to replay indefinitely on a nearby stereo as 17-year-old Greg Barnes , a teenager who attended Columbine High School and had lost one of his best friends in the massacre the previous year , hanged himself in the garage of his family 's home . Both Hoppus and DeLonge were sympathetic but stressed the song 's meaning during an MTV News interview in 2001 : Hoppus also told interviewers that he received fan mail following the song 's release from fans that had contemplated suicide , but decided not to go through with it after hearing the song . '' Rolling Stone '' compared the controversy to that of Ozzy Osbourne 's " Suicide Solution " , which similarly was playing as a teen committed suicide

This movie was a box office failure . Deol received mixed reactions from critics upon her performance . Savera R Someshwar of Rediff wrote " Esha , as a person , exudes a confidence that almost borders on arrogance . She 's athletic and seems perfectly capable of looking after herself in any situation . Esha , on screen , is required to convey three emotions : Love , sorrow and fear . Especially fear . No wonder she flounders . She is just unable to look terrorised . Even her alleged romance with costar Aftab has not helped her shed her stern demeanour in her romantic scenes . " Rakesh Budhu of Planet Bollywood wrote " She is n’t horrible , but given the hype , the demands and of course , comparisons , she surely is n’t up to the mark . Koi Mere Dil Se Poochhe is just plain old mediocre in such a way that you end up noticing the flaws in Esha ’s performance more . Her facial expressions need work , her attitude is beautiful but she seems too stern when it is not required . Of course , she is nowhere close to being a washout and if you are her fan you can appreciate the other aspects of her performances without completely losing faith in her future projects .

                CONTEXT=The album received mostly positive reviews from critics . David Fricke of '' Rolling Stone '' magazine gave a mostly positive review , describing '' Tragic Kingdom '' as " ear candy with good beats , not just bludgeon-by-numbers guitars " and its music as " a spry , white-suburban take on ska and Blondieesque pop " . Fricke however described " Do n't Speak " as " irritating swill " with " high-pitched rippling " from Gwen Stefani . In 2003 , the album was ranked number 441 on '' Rolling Stone '' magazine 's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time . '' Entertainment Weekly '' s David Browne attributed the album 's sales to Gwen Stefani 's " leggy , bleached-blond calling card " and concluded that " sex still sells " . Browne , however , described the music as " a hefty chunk of new-wave party bounce and Chili Peppers-style white-boy funk , with dashes of reggae , squealing hair-metal guitar , disco , ska-band horns " and the band as sounding like " savvy , lounge-bred pros " . Individual songs were singled out and commented on : " Just a Girl " was described as " a chirpy , ska-tinged bopper " , " Do n't Speak " as " an old-fangled power ballad " , " Sixteen " as a " song of solidarity with misunderstood teenage girls " , and " Spiderwebs " and " End It on This " as " Stefani acknowledg ing obsessions with losers and tr ying to break free . " Calling the album a marked improvement over " the diffuse , rambling songwriting of No Doubt 's two previous CDs " , Mike Boehm of the '' Los Angeles Times '' felt that on the album , " The band is bright , hard-hitting and kinetic , as sharp production captures the core , four-man instrumental team and adjunct horn section at their best " . In a favorable review for '' The Village Voice '' , critic Chuck Eddy felt that although " the album turns pretentious ... No Doubt resurrects the exuberance new-wave guys lost when '80s indie labels and college radio conned them into settling for slam-pit fits and wallflower wallpaper " . AllMusic called it " pure fun " and described the music as something " between '90s punk , third-wave ska , and pop sensibility " and a mix of " new wave melodicism , post-grunge rock , and West Coast sunshine " , indicating the songs " Spiderwebs " , " Just a Girl " , and " Do n't Speak " as " positively ruling the airwaves " . Yahoo! Music reviewer Bill Holdship called the album a " phenomenon " containing " hit after hit " , and describing " Spiderwebs " as " a terrific opener " . Reviewer Robert Christgau called Stefani " hebephrenic " and the album " hyped up " and not " as songful as its fun-besotted partisans claim " . At the 1997 Grammy Awards , No Doubt were nominated for Best New Artist and Best Rock Album

Named Best New Track by '' Pitchfork Media '' , editor Jayson Greene praised Lamar 's performance , writing " his hyper-vaulting flow and embedded rhyme patterns within rhyme patterns " . For its year-end list of " The 100 Best Tracks of 2014 " , '' Pitchfork '' ranked the song at number 23 . Also commenting on Lamar , '' Billboard '' 's Chris Payne wrote , " There are n't many A-list rappers who could handle a beat like this , but Kendrick is clearly one of them . " '' Rolling Stone '' editor Jon Dolan gave the song three-and-a-half out of five stars , commenting " Over offhandedly lovely , warp-speed psychedelic soul-jazz , Lamar unleashes a word-mad waterfall with a worried emotional core ( " analyze my demise I say I 'm super-anxious " , he raps ) . " '' Consequence of Sound '' editor Nina Corcoran wrote : " when combined with one of Lamar ’s hottest verses to date ( before '' To Pimp a Butterfly '' ) , the song explodes . But it does n’t stop there . FlyLo shows off his talent by shifting gears post-Kendrick verse the only way you can : insane keys , double-time bass drum , and unrelenting hand claps . Eventually , it ’s all swallowed up in massive swelling synth and choral hums , fading to a beautiful , passionate outro . " Directed by Hiro Murai , the video begins at a funeral ( including attendees Flying Lotus and Thundercat in cameo roles ) . Seemingly a sad video , it turns instantly joyful when the two late children - a boy and a girl - bound out of their caskets at the front of the church and dance gleefully down the aisle . The mourners ca n't see the children as they dance right out of the church and out onto a blacktop , but a group of other kids chases after them as they hop in a hearse and drive away . The clip was featured by several publications on their year-end list of best videos , including '' Pitchfork '' , '' Spin '' , and Stereogumwith the latter listing it at number one . The video received two nominations at the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards : Best Choreography and Best Cinematography , ultimately winning the latter

                CONTEXT=Living Stage Theatre Company was a theatre for social change founded in 1966 by Robert A. Alexander ( 1929 – 2008 ) . He served as the artistic director until 1995 . Located in Washington , D.C. , this professional improvisational theater offered participatory workshops to children , youth , teachers , parents , and community members . Living Stage ’s main philosophy was based in the belief that every one is born an artist and the act of creation is the ultimate act of self - affirmation . The company 's mission was to transform individuals and communities through creative empowerment . The projects that the Living Stage put on typically dealt with controversial and sensitive topics like race , economic inequality , the dangers of an overzealous American foreign policy , the atom bomb , violence , and freedom . The " Baltimore Incident " of 1971 is an excellent example of how controversial these productions could be . No matter how mixed opinions were , the Living Stage always elicited a reaction with their improvisational performances . During the 1980s the Living Stage began to reach out extensively to local initiatives like The District 's Alcohol and Drug Abuse Services Administration and created their own Community Services Project in order to continue to bring theater and creativity to underserved sections of society . The Living Stage championed New Left ideals like equality and social justice throughout the Reagan years , despite some criticisms about their message being " anachronistic " . The Living Stage dissolved after 36 years and was a venture of Arena Stage .

                CONTEXT=The show received a negative reception from most media publications . Associated Press television critic Frazier Moore lamented that Crystal " seemed incredibly listless " . He also questioned the purpose of the " Year of the Woman " theme writing , " The Oscar show itself seemed at odds with its own feminist theme . " Robert Bianco from the '' Pittsburgh Post-Gazette '' derided Allen 's musical production numbers , comparing them to the disastrous opening number at the 61st ceremony held in 1989 . Columnist Matt Roush of '' USA Today '' complained , " Crystal , in a by-now-familiar performance , has , in four years , taken a plum assignment and , by repetition , reduced it to shtick . " He also wrote that , " The song medley is getting old hat , " and the " smug references to his flop '' Mr. Saturday Night '' were out of an improv amateur night . " The telecast also received unfavorable reaction from various public feminist figures . In an interview with '' Los Angeles Daily News '' author and activist Betty Friedan condemned the " Year of the Woman " theme commenting , " It had no basis in reality . On behalf of women directors , cinematographer , and producers , I resent the travesty of calling that a tribute . " Likewise , President of the National Organization for Women 's Los Angeles chapter Tammy Bruce chastised ceremony 's feminist tribute as " one of the most hypocritical , patronizing things I saw in my whole life .

                CONTEXT=When Homer hears the 1978 song " Two Tickets to Paradise " by Eddie Money on the radio , he sings along and plays air guitar . As Homer is eating nachos at the football game , he makes up a song called " Nacho Man " , a reference to Village People 's 1978 song " Macho Man " . Homer 's " Rappin ' Ronnie Reagan " cassette is a reference to the 1984 Broadway show and novelty music video Rap Master Ronnie and Ronald Reagan . When Flanders is mistakenly arrested for taking drugs , Chief Wiggum asks him " Where 's your Messiah now ? " , a line commonly mistakenly believed to be spoken by Edward G. Robinson 's character Dathan in the 1956 film '' The Ten Commandments '' but in fact originates from Billy Crystal 's stand-up impersonation of Robinson . Ned 's dream involves him shooting at people inside the university clock tower based on the 1975 film '' The Deadly Tower '' , itself based on Charles Whitman 's 1966 killing spree . The scene where Homer chases Flanders 's car is a parallel of the sequence in '' Terminator 2 : Judgment Day '' , in which Robert Patrick 's character T-1000 chases the heroes in the police car after escaping from the hospital . Homer morphing through the Flanders hedge also parodies how the T-1000 's shape shifting abilities were shown in the film . It has since become a popular internet meme . When Rod and Todd are watching television in the Flanders 's living room , a picture of Leonardo da Vinci 's painting The Last Supper can be seen behind them . The homeless shelter that Homer and Flanders visit is called Helter Shelter , a reference to the 1968 song " Helter Skelter " by The Beatles . The song Helter Skelter has since been parodied , in the name of the Season 14 episode Helter Shelter . In its original American broadcast , " Homer Loves Flanders " finished 43rd in the ratings for the week of March 14 – 20 , 1994 , with a Nielsen rating of 10.9 . The episode was the third highest-rated show on the Fox network that week , following '' Beverly Hills , 90210 '' and '' Melrose Place ''

Its 14 minutes consisted of a number of scenes depicting Tate filming '' Eye of the Devil '' , dancing in nightclubs , and sightseeing around London , and also contained a brief interview with her . Asked about her acting ambitions , she replied , " I do n't fool myself . I ca n't see myself doing Shakespeare . " She spoke of her hopes of finding a niche in comedy , and in other interviews she expressed her desire to become " a light comedienne in the Carole Lombard style " . She discussed the type of contemporary actress she wanted to emulate and explained that there were two in particular that she was influenced by : Faye Dunaway and Catherine Deneuve . Of the latter , she said , " I 'd like to be an American Catherine Deneuve . She plays beautiful , sensitive , deep parts with a little bit of intelligence behind them . " Later in the year , '' Valley of the Dolls '' opened to almost uniformly negative reviews . Bosley Crowther wrote in '' The New York Times '' , " all a fairly respectful admirer of movies can do is laugh at it and turn away " . '' Newsweek '' said that the film " has no more sense of its own ludicrousness than a village idiot stumbling in manure " , but a later article read : " Astoundingly photogenic , infinitely curvaceous , Sharon Tate is one of the most smashing young things to hit Hollywood in a long time . " The three lead actresses were castigated in numerous publications , including '' The Saturday Review '' , which wrote , " Ten years ago ... Parkins , Duke , and Tate would more likely have been playing the hat check girls than movie-queens ; they are totally lacking in style , authority , or charm . " '' The Hollywood Reporter '' provided some positive comments , such as , " Sharon Tate emerges as the film 's most sympathetic character ... William H. Daniels ' photographic caress of her faultless face and enormous absorbent eyes is stunning . " Roger Ebert of the '' Chicago Sun-Times '' praised Tate as " a wonder to behold " , but after describing the dialogue in one scene as " the most offensive and appalling vulgarity ever thrown up by any civilization " , concluded that , " I will be unable to take her any more seriously as a sex symbol than Raquel Welch . " In late 1967 , Tate and Polanski returned to London and were frequent subjects of newspaper and magazine articles . Tate was depicted as being untraditional and modern , and was quoted as saying couples should live together before marrying . They were married in Chelsea , London , on January 20 , 1968 , with considerable publicity . Polanski was dressed in what the press described as " Edwardian finery " , while Tate was attired in a white minidress . The couple moved into Polanski 's mews house off Eaton Square in Belgravia , London . Photographer Peter Evans later described them as " the imperfect couple . They were the Douglas Fairbanks/Mary Pickford of our time ... Cool , nomadic , talented , and nicely shocking . " While Tate reportedly wanted a traditional marriage , Polanski remained somewhat promiscuous and described Tate 's attitude to his infidelity as " Sharon 's big hang-up " . He reminded Tate that she had promised that she would not try to change him . Tate accepted Polanski 's conditions , though she confided to friends that she hoped he would change . Peter Evans quoted Tate as saying , " We have a good arrangement . Roman lies to me and I pretend to believe him . " Polanski urged Tate to end her association with Martin Ransohoff , and Tate began to place less importance on her career until Polanski told her he wanted to be married to " a hippie , not a housewife . " The couple returned to Los Angeles and quickly became part of a social group that included some of the most successful young people in the film industry , including Warren Beatty , Jacqueline Bisset , Leslie Caron , Joan Collins , Mia Farrow , Jane Fonda , Peter Fonda , Laurence Harvey , Steve McQueen , Joanna Pettet and Peter Sellers ; older film stars like Yul Brynner , Kirk Douglas , Henry Fonda and Danny Kaye ; musicians such as Jim Morrison and The Mamas & the Papas ; and record producer Terry Melcher and his girlfriend , actress Candice Bergen . Jay Sebring remained one of the couple 's more frequent companions . Polanski 's circle of friends included people he had known since his youth in Poland such as Wojciech Frykowski and Frykowski 's girlfriend , coffee heiress Abigail Folger . Tate and Polanski moved into the Chateau Marmont Hotel in Los Angeles for a few months until they arranged to lease Patty Duke 's home on Summit Ridge Drive in Beverly Hills during the latter part of 1968 . The Polanski house was often full of strangers , and Tate regarded the casual atmosphere as part of the " free spirit " of the times , saying that she did not mind who came into her home as her motto was " live and let live . " Her close friend Leslie Caron later commented that the Polanskis were too trusting — " to the point of recklessness " — and that she had been alarmed by it

                CONTEXT=The '' All Eyes on Sharon Tate '' documentary was used to publicize the film . Its 14 minutes consisted of a number of scenes depicting Tate filming '' Eye of the Devil '' , dancing in nightclubs , and sightseeing around London , and also contained a brief interview with her . Asked about her acting ambitions , she replied , " I do n't fool myself . I ca n't see myself doing Shakespeare . " She spoke of her hopes of finding a niche in comedy , and in other interviews she expressed her desire to become " a light comedienne in the Carole Lombard style " . She discussed the type of contemporary actress she wanted to emulate and explained that there were two in particular that she was influenced by : Faye Dunaway and Catherine Deneuve . Of the latter , she said , " I 'd like to be an American Catherine Deneuve . She plays beautiful , sensitive , deep parts with a little bit of intelligence behind them . " Later in the year , '' Valley of the Dolls '' opened to almost uniformly negative reviews . Bosley Crowther wrote in '' The New York Times '' , " all a fairly respectful admirer of movies can do is laugh at it and turn away " . '' Newsweek '' said that the film " has no more sense of its own ludicrousness than a village idiot stumbling in manure " , but a later article read : " Astoundingly photogenic , infinitely curvaceous , Sharon Tate is one of the most smashing young things to hit Hollywood in a long time . " The three lead actresses were castigated in numerous publications , including '' The Saturday Review '' , which wrote , " Ten years ago ... Parkins , Duke , and Tate would more likely have been playing the hat check girls than movie-queens ; they are totally lacking in style , authority , or charm . " '' The Hollywood Reporter '' provided some positive comments , such as , " Sharon Tate emerges as the film 's most sympathetic character ... William H. Daniels ' photographic caress of her faultless face and enormous absorbent eyes is stunning . " Roger Ebert of the '' Chicago Sun-Times '' praised Tate as " a wonder to behold " , but after describing the dialogue in one scene as " the most offensive and appalling vulgarity ever thrown up by any civilization " , concluded that , " I will be unable to take her any more seriously as a sex symbol than Raquel Welch . " In late 1967 , Tate and Polanski returned to London and were frequent subjects of newspaper and magazine articles . Tate was depicted as being untraditional and modern , and was quoted as saying couples should live together before marrying . They were married in Chelsea , London , on January 20 , 1968 , with considerable publicity . Polanski was dressed in what the press described as " Edwardian finery " , while Tate was attired in a white minidress . The couple moved into Polanski 's mews house off Eaton Square in Belgravia , London . Photographer Peter Evans later described them as " the imperfect couple . They were the Douglas Fairbanks/Mary Pickford of our time ... Cool , nomadic , talented , and nicely shocking . " While Tate reportedly wanted a traditional marriage , Polanski remained somewhat promiscuous and described Tate 's attitude to his infidelity as " Sharon 's big hang-up " . He reminded Tate that she had promised that she would not try to change him . Tate accepted Polanski 's conditions , though she confided to friends that she hoped he would change . Peter Evans quoted Tate as saying , " We have a good arrangement . Roman lies to me and I pretend to believe him . " Polanski urged Tate to end her association with Martin Ransohoff , and Tate began to place less importance on her career until Polanski told her he wanted to be married to " a hippie , not a housewife . " The couple returned to Los Angeles and quickly became part of a social group that included some of the most successful young people in the film industry , including Warren Beatty , Jacqueline Bisset , Leslie Caron , Joan Collins , Mia Farrow , Jane Fonda , Peter Fonda , Laurence Harvey , Steve McQueen , Joanna Pettet and Peter Sellers ; older film stars like Yul Brynner , Kirk Douglas , Henry Fonda and Danny Kaye ; musicians such as Jim Morrison and The Mamas & the Papas ; and record producer Terry Melcher and his girlfriend , actress Candice Bergen . Jay Sebring remained one of the couple 's more frequent companions . Polanski 's circle of friends included people he had known since his youth in Poland such as Wojciech Frykowski and Frykowski 's girlfriend , coffee heiress Abigail Folger . Tate and Polanski moved into the Chateau Marmont Hotel in Los Angeles for a few months until they arranged to lease Patty Duke 's home on Summit Ridge Drive in Beverly Hills during the latter part of 1968 . The Polanski house was often full of strangers , and Tate regarded the casual atmosphere as part of the " free spirit " of the times , saying that she did not mind who came into her home as her motto was " live and let live . " Her close friend Leslie Caron later commented that the Polanskis were too trusting — " to the point of recklessness " — and that she had been alarmed by it

That there was a space opening up , maybe a billion little loudspeakers walking around the planet , but nobody was really thinking of this as a space for creative music . So I set out to make these tiny little fragments and then , of course , in the poetic sense , the idea of these little sound carrying objects traversing the planet , I started to think of these as a connection , as a sort of postcard into somebody 's life , into their space . " Richter 's 2010 album '' Infra '' takes as its central theme the 2005 terrorist bombings in London , and is an extension of his 25-minute score for a ballet of the same name choreographed by Wayne McGregor and staged at the Royal Opera House . '' Infra '' comprises music written for piano , electronics and string quintet , plus the full performance score and material that subsequently developed from the construction of the album . '' Pitchfork '' described the album as " achingly gorgeous " and '' The Independent '' newspaper characterised it as " a journey in 13 episodes , emerging from a blur of static and finding its way in a repeated phrase that grows in loveliness . " Richter 's recomposed version of Vivaldi 's '' The Four Seasons '' , '' Recomposed by Max Richter : Vivaldi – The Four Seasons '' , was premiered in the UK at the Barbican Centre on 31 October 2012 , performed by the Britten Sinfonia , conducted by André de Ridder and with violinist Daniel Hope . Although Richter said that he had discarded 75 % of Vivaldi 's original material , the parts he does use are phased and looped , emphasising his grounding in postmodern and minimalist music . The album topped the iTunes classical chart in the UK , Germany and the US . The US launch concert in New York at Le Poisson Rouge was recorded by NPR and streamed

The Royal Albert Hall was reportedly unavailable , so in August 2004 the EBU announced that DR would stage the event instead . Eurovision Song Contest supervisor Svante Stockselius said that Denmark 's previous experience of hosting Eurovision events ( the 2001 Contest and the first Junior Eurovision Song Contest in 2003 ) were influential in the Union 's choice . The event was codenamed '' Extravaganza '' . 1998 Eurovision winner Dana International , who appeared at the event , later went to suggest that the reason behind the change of host country was also due to the fact that the BBC wanted to present the show " with humour " as though to poke fun at the Contest , an idea that proved to be less popular with the EBU .

We learn that Random is rarely home , Peggy is having an affair , and Skip 's ( " Skipper " to his mother ) sexual orientation is a scandal . In the second , Kim Coolzip presents a seductive commercial for liquid meat , which segues into her appearance on a charity fund-raising telethon . The third is the game show , in which Skip Coolzip " gives back " to Native Americans his family 's car , then his father 's squad car ( " the black screamer " ) , and finally , " everything . " He is also assigned , with his sister , to take over the Academy Awards celebration " with these stirring words : ' Eat flaming death , fascist media pigs . ' " The second side of the album , " We 've Lost Our Big Kabloona " , culminates in the hostage situation , on stage during the live broadcast of the Academy Awards . While accepting an award for a police/family drama called " Squat ! , " which stars their parents and seems identical to the show on the first side of the album , Skip and Kim Coolzip reveal a gun . They demand that the President of the United States appear in Hollywood " with a plane full of cash and all those broken treaties , " or they will shoot the nominees one by one in alphabetical order . This sketch was inspired by Sacheen Littlefeather 's appearance at the 1973 Academy Awards

                CONTEXT=On January 15 , the Vikings filed for trademarks on the phrases " Minneapolis Miracle " and " Minnesota Miracle " for use on over 100 items , from football helmets to bathing suits . At the 7th Annual NFL Honors , the Minneapolis Miracle won the NFL Play of the Year Award . In March 2018 , the NFL instituted a new rule that eliminated the requirement to kneel down or kick the point after following a game-ending touchdown that gives a team the victory ( it is still allowed if needed ) . In the Minnesota Miracle game , no result of an extra-point play would have changed the game result ( except for the score ) . The requirement had been in place because an extra-point play can affect point differential , and point differential is used as a tie-breaker for determining playoff seeding . However , there are many higher-ranked tie-breakers , so point differential is very unlikely to be used , and eliminating the anticlimax and confusion seen at the Minnesota Miracle game was deemed more important . In April 2018 , it was announced that Diggs ' cleats would be displayed in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton , Ohio . The play also won the Best Moment ESPY Award at the 2018 ESPY Awards

The winning song was '' Rock Bottom '' , written , composed and performed by Lynsey de Paul and Mike Moran . The song says that when people are in a bad situation they should work to solve problems and not be pessimistic about tragedies . Apparently it represents the situation at the time . This was reflected in the unrest surrounding the 1977 Song for Europe and the subsequent Eurovision Song Contest , which was due to take place in Wembley on April 2nd . Due to the cameramen 's industrial action that spread throughout the BBC , many live broadcasts were affected in the coming weeks and the 1977 Eurovision final was cancelled . On 30 March the strike was resolved and the contest was rescheduled for 7 May . At the Eurovision final , the UK entry was performed ninth in the running order and finished in 2nd place , a record 10th British entry to finish 2nd . The winning song reached No. 19 in the UK singles chart , the last chart hit for de Paul , her first in two years . A German version of the song was released as '' Für Immer '' . De Paul and Moran did release one further single together , but it failed to chart . Pete Murray provided the television commentary on BBC 1 and Terry Wogan provided the radio commentary on BBC Radio 2 , this would be Wogan 's final time he provided the contests commentary for radio , the following year he began regularly presenting the television coverage .

The Royal Albert Hall was reportedly unavailable , so in August 2004 the EBU announced that DR would stage the event instead . Eurovision Song Contest supervisor Svante Stockselius said that Denmark 's previous experience of hosting Eurovision events ( the 2001 Contest and the first Junior Eurovision Song Contest in 2003 ) were influential in the Union 's choice . The event was codenamed '' Extravaganza '' . 1998 Eurovision winner Dana International , who appeared at the event , later went to suggest that the reason behind the change of host country was also due to the fact that the BBC wanted to present the show " with humour " as though to poke fun at the Contest , an idea that proved to be less popular with the EBU . The BBC went on to broadcast their own 50th anniversary program , '' Boom Bang-a-Bang : 50 Years of Eurovision '' , in May 2006

Also commenting on Lamar , '' Billboard '' 's Chris Payne wrote , " There are n't many A-list rappers who could handle a beat like this , but Kendrick is clearly one of them . " '' Rolling Stone '' editor Jon Dolan gave the song three-and-a-half out of five stars , commenting " Over offhandedly lovely , warp-speed psychedelic soul-jazz , Lamar unleashes a word-mad waterfall with a worried emotional core ( " analyze my demise I say I 'm super-anxious " , he raps ) . " '' Consequence of Sound '' editor Nina Corcoran wrote : " when combined with one of Lamar ’s hottest verses to date ( before '' To Pimp a Butterfly '' ) , the song explodes . But it does n’t stop there . FlyLo shows off his talent by shifting gears post-Kendrick verse the only way you can : insane keys , double-time bass drum , and unrelenting hand claps . Eventually , it ’s all swallowed up in massive swelling synth and choral hums , fading to a beautiful , passionate outro . " Directed by Hiro Murai , the video begins at a funeral ( including attendees Flying Lotus and Thundercat in cameo roles ) . Seemingly a sad video , it turns instantly joyful when the two late children - a boy and a girl - bound out of their caskets at the front of the church and dance gleefully down the aisle . The mourners ca n't see the children as they dance right out of the church and out onto a blacktop , but a group of other kids chases after them as they hop in a hearse and drive away . The clip was featured by several publications on their year-end list of best videos , including '' Pitchfork '' , '' Spin '' , and Stereogumwith the latter listing it at number one . The video received two nominations at the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards : Best Choreography and Best Cinematography , ultimately winning the latter

                CONTEXT=The '' All Eyes on Sharon Tate '' documentary was used to publicize the film . Its 14 minutes consisted of a number of scenes depicting Tate filming '' Eye of the Devil '' , dancing in nightclubs , and sightseeing around London , and also contained a brief interview with her . Asked about her acting ambitions , she replied , " I do n't fool myself . I ca n't see myself doing Shakespeare . " She spoke of her hopes of finding a niche in comedy , and in other interviews she expressed her desire to become " a light comedienne in the Carole Lombard style " . She discussed the type of contemporary actress she wanted to emulate and explained that there were two in particular that she was influenced by : Faye Dunaway and Catherine Deneuve . Of the latter , she said , " I 'd like to be an American Catherine Deneuve . She plays beautiful , sensitive , deep parts with a little bit of intelligence behind them . " Later in the year , '' Valley of the Dolls '' opened to almost uniformly negative reviews . Bosley Crowther wrote in '' The New York Times '' , " all a fairly respectful admirer of movies can do is laugh at it and turn away " . '' Newsweek '' said that the film " has no more sense of its own ludicrousness than a village idiot stumbling in manure " , but a later article read : " Astoundingly photogenic , infinitely curvaceous , Sharon Tate is one of the most smashing young things to hit Hollywood in a long time . " The three lead actresses were castigated in numerous publications , including '' The Saturday Review '' , which wrote , " Ten years ago ... Parkins , Duke , and Tate would more likely have been playing the hat check girls than movie-queens ; they are totally lacking in style , authority , or charm . " '' The Hollywood Reporter '' provided some positive comments , such as , " Sharon Tate emerges as the film 's most sympathetic character ... William H. Daniels ' photographic caress of her faultless face and enormous absorbent eyes is stunning . " Roger Ebert of the '' Chicago Sun-Times '' praised Tate as " a wonder to behold " , but after describing the dialogue in one scene as " the most offensive and appalling vulgarity ever thrown up by any civilization " , concluded that , " I will be unable to take her any more seriously as a sex symbol than Raquel Welch . " In late 1967 , Tate and Polanski returned to London and were frequent subjects of newspaper and magazine articles . Tate was depicted as being untraditional and modern , and was quoted as saying couples should live together before marrying . They were married in Chelsea , London , on January 20 , 1968 , with considerable publicity . Polanski was dressed in what the press described as " Edwardian finery " , while Tate was attired in a white minidress . The couple moved into Polanski 's mews house off Eaton Square in Belgravia , London . Photographer Peter Evans later described them as " the imperfect couple . They were the Douglas Fairbanks/Mary Pickford of our time ... Cool , nomadic , talented , and nicely shocking . " While Tate reportedly wanted a traditional marriage , Polanski remained somewhat promiscuous and described Tate 's attitude to his infidelity as " Sharon 's big hang-up " . He reminded Tate that she had promised that she would not try to change him . Tate accepted Polanski 's conditions , though she confided to friends that she hoped he would change . Peter Evans quoted Tate as saying , " We have a good arrangement . Roman lies to me and I pretend to believe him . " Polanski urged Tate to end her association with Martin Ransohoff , and Tate began to place less importance on her career until Polanski told her he wanted to be married to " a hippie , not a housewife . " The couple returned to Los Angeles and quickly became part of a social group that included some of the most successful young people in the film industry , including Warren Beatty , Jacqueline Bisset , Leslie Caron , Joan Collins , Mia Farrow , Jane Fonda , Peter Fonda , Laurence Harvey , Steve McQueen , Joanna Pettet and Peter Sellers ; older film stars like Yul Brynner , Kirk Douglas , Henry Fonda and Danny Kaye ; musicians such as Jim Morrison and The Mamas & the Papas ; and record producer Terry Melcher and his girlfriend , actress Candice Bergen . Jay Sebring remained one of the couple 's more frequent companions . Polanski 's circle of friends included people he had known since his youth in Poland such as Wojciech Frykowski and Frykowski 's girlfriend , coffee heiress Abigail Folger . Tate and Polanski moved into the Chateau Marmont Hotel in Los Angeles for a few months until they arranged to lease Patty Duke 's home on Summit Ridge Drive in Beverly Hills during the latter part of 1968 . The Polanski house was often full of strangers , and Tate regarded the casual atmosphere as part of the " free spirit " of the times , saying that she did not mind who came into her home as her motto was " live and let live . " Her close friend Leslie Caron later commented that the Polanskis were too trusting — " to the point of recklessness " — and that she had been alarmed by it

The original crop - over tradition began in 1687 as a way to mark the end of the yearly harvest , but was wide - spread throughout the region at the time , including in St. Vincent , Trinidad and Jamaica . As such , it still shares similarities with Carnival in Brazil and Trinidad . Many crop - over celebrations were organized and sponsored by planters , who used gifts of food and liquor as a means of reenforcing and excusing the continued enslavement of their labour force . However , slaves would also have often unsanctioned fetes that featured singing , dancing and accompaniment by bottles filled with water , shak - shak , banjo , triangle , fiddle , guitar , and bones that were more in keeping with their ancestral culture . Other traditions that were later added included climbing a greased pole , feasting and drinking competitions . However , with the harsh effects of World War II on Barbados , these annual celebrations came to an end . The Crop Over Festival was first launched on June 1 , 1970 , but was not officially called a festival until 4 years later .

                CONTEXT=Gaga performed " Dance in the Dark " at the Brit Awards on February 16 , 2010 , at Earls Court Exhibition Centre . The performance was inspired by the recent death of her friend , fashion designer Alexander McQueen . Initially she had planned a different version of the performance , but changed the concept at the last minute , since she wanted to pay tribute to McQueen . Hence she chose acoustic versions of her songs " Telephone " and " Dance in the Dark " . She started the performance by sitting in front of a piano and announcing " This is for Alexander McQueen . " The whole performance was low-key compared to her previous ones . The stage was decked out in white , and perched on a pedestal was a statue of Gaga wearing a piano skirt and the lobster-claw heels she wore in her " Bad Romance " music video . After finishing an acoustic performance of " Telephone " , she got up from her piano as the disco groove of " Dance in the Dark " was heard throughout the room . She wore a lace bodysuit and a large bouffant wig , took to a giant keytar and performed a techno rendition of the track . After the show , she posted a message on her Twitter account : " Tonight 's performance is inspired by our friend . Mask by Phillip Treacy , Sculpture by Nick Knight , Music by Lady Gaga . We miss you . " " Dance in the Dark " is performed on the singer 's 2018 – 2019 Las Vegas residency show , Lady Gaga Enigma . The song is preceded by an interlude , which introduces the singer 's alien counterpart , named Enigma . Gaga then appears on stage and performs the song in a fluorescent green jacket

                CONTEXT=The show received a negative reception from most media publications . Associated Press television critic Frazier Moore lamented that Crystal " seemed incredibly listless " . He also questioned the purpose of the " Year of the Woman " theme writing , " The Oscar show itself seemed at odds with its own feminist theme . " Robert Bianco from the '' Pittsburgh Post-Gazette '' derided Allen 's musical production numbers , comparing them to the disastrous opening number at the 61st ceremony held in 1989 . Columnist Matt Roush of '' USA Today '' complained , " Crystal , in a by-now-familiar performance , has , in four years , taken a plum assignment and , by repetition , reduced it to shtick . " He also wrote that , " The song medley is getting old hat , " and the " smug references to his flop '' Mr. Saturday Night '' were out of an improv amateur night . " The telecast also received unfavorable reaction from various public feminist figures . In an interview with '' Los Angeles Daily News '' author and activist Betty Friedan condemned the " Year of the Woman " theme commenting , " It had no basis in reality . On behalf of women directors , cinematographer , and producers , I resent the travesty of calling that a tribute . " Likewise , President of the National Organization for Women 's Los Angeles chapter Tammy Bruce chastised ceremony 's feminist tribute as " one of the most hypocritical , patronizing things I saw in my whole life . " In response , Gil Cates responded towards the criticism of the theme stating , " The theme developed and raised consciousness in a way that I think is positive , not only for the individual in general but for individual women specifically . " He also quoted an ancient Chinese proverb later made famous by former U.S. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt saying , " It is better to light one candle than to curse the darkness " Despite the adverse reception , the ABC broadcast drew in an average of 45.7 million people over its length , which was a 3 % increase from the previous year 's ceremony . The show also drew higher Nielsen ratings compared to the previous ceremony with 31.2 % of households watching over a 51 share . It also drew a higher 18 – 49 demo rating with a 20.1 rating among viewers in that demographic

                CONTEXT=The '' All Eyes on Sharon Tate '' documentary was used to publicize the film . Its 14 minutes consisted of a number of scenes depicting Tate filming '' Eye of the Devil '' , dancing in nightclubs , and sightseeing around London , and also contained a brief interview with her . Asked about her acting ambitions , she replied , " I do n't fool myself . I ca n't see myself doing Shakespeare . " She spoke of her hopes of finding a niche in comedy , and in other interviews she expressed her desire to become " a light comedienne in the Carole Lombard style " . She discussed the type of contemporary actress she wanted to emulate and explained that there were two in particular that she was influenced by : Faye Dunaway and Catherine Deneuve . Of the latter , she said , " I 'd like to be an American Catherine Deneuve . She plays beautiful , sensitive , deep parts with a little bit of intelligence behind them . " Later in the year , '' Valley of the Dolls '' opened to almost uniformly negative reviews . Bosley Crowther wrote in '' The New York Times '' , " all a fairly respectful admirer of movies can do is laugh at it and turn away " . '' Newsweek '' said that the film " has no more sense of its own ludicrousness than a village idiot stumbling in manure " , but a later article read : " Astoundingly photogenic , infinitely curvaceous , Sharon Tate is one of the most smashing young things to hit Hollywood in a long time . " The three lead actresses were castigated in numerous publications , including '' The Saturday Review '' , which wrote , " Ten years ago ... Parkins , Duke , and Tate would more likely have been playing the hat check girls than movie-queens ; they are totally lacking in style , authority , or charm . " '' The Hollywood Reporter '' provided some positive comments , such as , " Sharon Tate emerges as the film 's most sympathetic character ... William H. Daniels ' photographic caress of her faultless face and enormous absorbent eyes is stunning . " Roger Ebert of the '' Chicago Sun-Times '' praised Tate as " a wonder to behold " , but after describing the dialogue in one scene as " the most offensive and appalling vulgarity ever thrown up by any civilization " , concluded that , " I will be unable to take her any more seriously as a sex symbol than Raquel Welch . " In late 1967 , Tate and Polanski returned to London and were frequent subjects of newspaper and magazine articles . Tate was depicted as being untraditional and modern , and was quoted as saying couples should live together before marrying . They were married in Chelsea , London , on January 20 , 1968 , with considerable publicity . Polanski was dressed in what the press described as " Edwardian finery " , while Tate was attired in a white minidress . The couple moved into Polanski 's mews house off Eaton Square in Belgravia , London . Photographer Peter Evans later described them as " the imperfect couple . They were the Douglas Fairbanks/Mary Pickford of our time ... Cool , nomadic , talented , and nicely shocking . " While Tate reportedly wanted a traditional marriage , Polanski remained somewhat promiscuous and described Tate 's attitude to his infidelity as " Sharon 's big hang-up " . He reminded Tate that she had promised that she would not try to change him . Tate accepted Polanski 's conditions , though she confided to friends that she hoped he would change . Peter Evans quoted Tate as saying , " We have a good arrangement . Roman lies to me and I pretend to believe him . " Polanski urged Tate to end her association with Martin Ransohoff , and Tate began to place less importance on her career until Polanski told her he wanted to be married to " a hippie , not a housewife . " The couple returned to Los Angeles and quickly became part of a social group that included some of the most successful young people in the film industry , including Warren Beatty , Jacqueline Bisset , Leslie Caron , Joan Collins , Mia Farrow , Jane Fonda , Peter Fonda , Laurence Harvey , Steve McQueen , Joanna Pettet and Peter Sellers ; older film stars like Yul Brynner , Kirk Douglas , Henry Fonda and Danny Kaye ; musicians such as Jim Morrison and The Mamas & the Papas ; and record producer Terry Melcher and his girlfriend , actress Candice Bergen . Jay Sebring remained one of the couple 's more frequent companions . Polanski 's circle of friends included people he had known since his youth in Poland such as Wojciech Frykowski and Frykowski 's girlfriend , coffee heiress Abigail Folger . Tate and Polanski moved into the Chateau Marmont Hotel in Los Angeles for a few months until they arranged to lease Patty Duke 's home on Summit Ridge Drive in Beverly Hills during the latter part of 1968 . The Polanski house was often full of strangers , and Tate regarded the casual atmosphere as part of the " free spirit " of the times , saying that she did not mind who came into her home as her motto was " live and let live . " Her close friend Leslie Caron later commented that the Polanskis were too trusting — " to the point of recklessness " — and that she had been alarmed by it

                CONTEXT=Robert Carr ( 12 April 1881 – 20 November 1948 ) was an English baritone singer and prolific recording artist . Born in London , he studied at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama under Bantock Pierrepoint . He recorded under his own name and as variously Richard Condor , William Duncan , Harry Durrant , Robert Durrant , Ernest Gray , Bobby Gray , Robert Oswald , and perhaps some others . His recording repertoire was varied ranging from popular songs of the day , sentimental songs , hymns and sacred songs , British patriotic songs ( particularly during the First World War ) as well as Classical music , most notably a complete recording of Gounod 's Faust in 1929 under Sir Thomas Beecham under the Columbia label . He also took part in recordings of several Gilbert and Sullivan operettas as well as Edward German 's Merrie England under the direction of Joe Batten . Shortly after the Titanic disaster in 1912 he recorded two songs ( on both sides of the same record ) , " Stand by your Post " and " Be British " in memory of the victims . The proceeds from the record 's sales went towards helping the victims ' families . This was one of the earliest examples of producing recordings to raise funds for charitable causes and it is one that has been continued in subsequent years , most notably with Live Aid in the 1980s and Bob Geldof 's record Feed the World to raise money for victims of the Ethiopia Famine in 1984 . This was the continuation of a tradition that had its origins with Robert Carr 's Titanic record . During the First World War ( where he served in the British Army ) he recorded a number of songs as part of the recruiting effort and to bolster morale , most notably " We Must All Fall In " and " Laddie in Khaki " , composed by Ivor Novello .

                CONTEXT=The album received mostly positive reviews from critics . David Fricke of '' Rolling Stone '' magazine gave a mostly positive review , describing '' Tragic Kingdom '' as " ear candy with good beats , not just bludgeon-by-numbers guitars " and its music as " a spry , white-suburban take on ska and Blondieesque pop " . Fricke however described " Do n't Speak " as " irritating swill " with " high-pitched rippling " from Gwen Stefani . In 2003 , the album was ranked number 441 on '' Rolling Stone '' magazine 's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time . '' Entertainment Weekly '' s David Browne attributed the album 's sales to Gwen Stefani 's " leggy , bleached-blond calling card " and concluded that " sex still sells " . Browne , however , described the music as " a hefty chunk of new-wave party bounce and Chili Peppers-style white-boy funk , with dashes of reggae , squealing hair-metal guitar , disco , ska-band horns " and the band as sounding like " savvy , lounge-bred pros " . Individual songs were singled out and commented on : " Just a Girl " was described as " a chirpy , ska-tinged bopper " , " Do n't Speak " as " an old-fangled power ballad " , " Sixteen " as a " song of solidarity with misunderstood teenage girls " , and " Spiderwebs " and " End It on This " as " Stefani acknowledg ing obsessions with losers and tr ying to break free . " Calling the album a marked improvement over " the diffuse , rambling songwriting of No Doubt 's two previous CDs " , Mike Boehm of the '' Los Angeles Times '' felt that on the album , " The band is bright , hard-hitting and kinetic , as sharp production captures the core , four-man instrumental team and adjunct horn section at their best " . In a favorable review for '' The Village Voice '' , critic Chuck Eddy felt that although " the album turns pretentious ... No Doubt resurrects the exuberance new-wave guys lost when '80s indie labels and college radio conned them into settling for slam-pit fits and wallflower wallpaper " . AllMusic called it " pure fun " and described the music as something " between '90s punk , third-wave ska , and pop sensibility " and a mix of " new wave melodicism , post-grunge rock , and West Coast sunshine " , indicating the songs " Spiderwebs " , " Just a Girl " , and " Do n't Speak " as " positively ruling the airwaves " . Yahoo! Music reviewer Bill Holdship called the album a " phenomenon " containing " hit after hit " , and describing " Spiderwebs " as " a terrific opener " . Reviewer Robert Christgau called Stefani " hebephrenic " and the album " hyped up " and not " as songful as its fun-besotted partisans claim " . At the 1997 Grammy Awards , No Doubt were nominated for Best New Artist and Best Rock Album

They later posted a 50-second snippet of an instrumental which media claimed was from Madonna , but the sample was traced back to Dutch DJ Sander Kleinenberg and his song " We Are Superstars " . Oseary confirmed that Madonna looked forward to a 2015 release date for the album . However , on November 28 , 2014 , two songs titled " Rebel Heart " and " Wash All Over Me " were leaked onto the Internet ; the songs were taken down immediately , and Oseary tweeted asking for help finding the source of the leaks . On December 17 , 2014 , thirteen songs were leaked , as well as artwork suggesting the album was to be named '' Iconic '' . An aggravated Madonna clarified that the songs were demo versions from earlier recordings ; she described the leak as " artistic rape " . The singer was criticized for referring to the hack as " terrorism " , due to the then-recent Peshawar school massacre and the Sydney hostage crisis . Madonna said in a '' Billboard '' interview that after the leak she and her team tried to trace it to the source , but ultimately decided to release the finished songs . Referring to the Sony Pictures Entertainment hack , she was critical of the Internet and explained that the incident led to her securing her laptop and hard drives , and disabling the Wi-Fi . " I wanted to plan everything in advance . Release the single , shoot a video , start talking about my record . And you know , prepare for the release of the entire album and have everything set up just so ... But we sort of were left with no choice " , she added

                CONTEXT=The show received a negative reception from most media publications . Associated Press television critic Frazier Moore lamented that Crystal " seemed incredibly listless " . He also questioned the purpose of the " Year of the Woman " theme writing , " The Oscar show itself seemed at odds with its own feminist theme . " Robert Bianco from the '' Pittsburgh Post-Gazette '' derided Allen 's musical production numbers , comparing them to the disastrous opening number at the 61st ceremony held in 1989 . Columnist Matt Roush of '' USA Today '' complained , " Crystal , in a by-now-familiar performance , has , in four years , taken a plum assignment and , by repetition , reduced it to shtick . " He also wrote that , " The song medley is getting old hat , " and the " smug references to his flop '' Mr. Saturday Night '' were out of an improv amateur night . " The telecast also received unfavorable reaction from various public feminist figures . In an interview with '' Los Angeles Daily News '' author and activist Betty Friedan condemned the " Year of the Woman " theme commenting , " It had no basis in reality . On behalf of women directors , cinematographer , and producers , I resent the travesty of calling that a tribute . " Likewise , President of the National Organization for Women 's Los Angeles chapter Tammy Bruce chastised ceremony 's feminist tribute as " one of the most hypocritical , patronizing things I saw in my whole life . " In response , Gil Cates responded towards the criticism of the theme stating , " The theme developed and raised consciousness in a way that I think is positive , not only for the individual in general but for individual women specifically . " He also quoted an ancient Chinese proverb later made famous by former U.S. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt saying , " It is better to light one candle than to curse the darkness " Despite the adverse reception , the ABC broadcast drew in an average of 45.7 million people over its length , which was a 3 % increase from the previous year 's ceremony . The show also drew higher Nielsen ratings compared to the previous ceremony with 31.2 % of households watching over a 51 share . It also drew a higher 18 – 49 demo rating with a 20.1 rating among viewers in that demographic

                CONTEXT=The '' All Eyes on Sharon Tate '' documentary was used to publicize the film . Its 14 minutes consisted of a number of scenes depicting Tate filming '' Eye of the Devil '' , dancing in nightclubs , and sightseeing around London , and also contained a brief interview with her . Asked about her acting ambitions , she replied , " I do n't fool myself . I ca n't see myself doing Shakespeare . " She spoke of her hopes of finding a niche in comedy , and in other interviews she expressed her desire to become " a light comedienne in the Carole Lombard style " . She discussed the type of contemporary actress she wanted to emulate and explained that there were two in particular that she was influenced by : Faye Dunaway and Catherine Deneuve . Of the latter , she said , " I 'd like to be an American Catherine Deneuve . She plays beautiful , sensitive , deep parts with a little bit of intelligence behind them . " Later in the year , '' Valley of the Dolls '' opened to almost uniformly negative reviews . Bosley Crowther wrote in '' The New York Times '' , " all a fairly respectful admirer of movies can do is laugh at it and turn away " . '' Newsweek '' said that the film " has no more sense of its own ludicrousness than a village idiot stumbling in manure " , but a later article read : " Astoundingly photogenic , infinitely curvaceous , Sharon Tate is one of the most smashing young things to hit Hollywood in a long time . " The three lead actresses were castigated in numerous publications , including '' The Saturday Review '' , which wrote , " Ten years ago ... Parkins , Duke , and Tate would more likely have been playing the hat check girls than movie-queens ; they are totally lacking in style , authority , or charm . " '' The Hollywood Reporter '' provided some positive comments , such as , " Sharon Tate emerges as the film 's most sympathetic character ... William H. Daniels ' photographic caress of her faultless face and enormous absorbent eyes is stunning . " Roger Ebert of the '' Chicago Sun-Times '' praised Tate as " a wonder to behold " , but after describing the dialogue in one scene as " the most offensive and appalling vulgarity ever thrown up by any civilization " , concluded that , " I will be unable to take her any more seriously as a sex symbol than Raquel Welch . " In late 1967 , Tate and Polanski returned to London and were frequent subjects of newspaper and magazine articles . Tate was depicted as being untraditional and modern , and was quoted as saying couples should live together before marrying . They were married in Chelsea , London , on January 20 , 1968 , with considerable publicity . Polanski was dressed in what the press described as " Edwardian finery " , while Tate was attired in a white minidress . The couple moved into Polanski 's mews house off Eaton Square in Belgravia , London . Photographer Peter Evans later described them as " the imperfect couple . They were the Douglas Fairbanks/Mary Pickford of our time ... Cool , nomadic , talented , and nicely shocking . " While Tate reportedly wanted a traditional marriage , Polanski remained somewhat promiscuous and described Tate 's attitude to his infidelity as " Sharon 's big hang-up " . He reminded Tate that she had promised that she would not try to change him . Tate accepted Polanski 's conditions , though she confided to friends that she hoped he would change . Peter Evans quoted Tate as saying , " We have a good arrangement . Roman lies to me and I pretend to believe him . " Polanski urged Tate to end her association with Martin Ransohoff , and Tate began to place less importance on her career until Polanski told her he wanted to be married to " a hippie , not a housewife . " The couple returned to Los Angeles and quickly became part of a social group that included some of the most successful young people in the film industry , including Warren Beatty , Jacqueline Bisset , Leslie Caron , Joan Collins , Mia Farrow , Jane Fonda , Peter Fonda , Laurence Harvey , Steve McQueen , Joanna Pettet and Peter Sellers ; older film stars like Yul Brynner , Kirk Douglas , Henry Fonda and Danny Kaye ; musicians such as Jim Morrison and The Mamas & the Papas ; and record producer Terry Melcher and his girlfriend , actress Candice Bergen . Jay Sebring remained one of the couple 's more frequent companions . Polanski 's circle of friends included people he had known since his youth in Poland such as Wojciech Frykowski and Frykowski 's girlfriend , coffee heiress Abigail Folger . Tate and Polanski moved into the Chateau Marmont Hotel in Los Angeles for a few months until they arranged to lease Patty Duke 's home on Summit Ridge Drive in Beverly Hills during the latter part of 1968 . The Polanski house was often full of strangers , and Tate regarded the casual atmosphere as part of the " free spirit " of the times , saying that she did not mind who came into her home as her motto was " live and let live . " Her close friend Leslie Caron later commented that the Polanskis were too trusting — " to the point of recklessness " — and that she had been alarmed by it

Their début album Usurper of the Sun Rays was self - released on an MC - cassette in 1993 . It presented a very particular brew that incorporated elements of heavy and at the same time psychedelic music based on sound experimentation . It was hypnotic , heavy and sophisticated . In 1994 , the group might have split , but two musicians of a respected mainstream heavy - metal outfit — Soma — made the band live on . Same year the MDP recorded at Asparez studio their first prog - suite — the River — which today is mentioned in all anthologies of Armenian rock . Next few years the band spent in Russia and released their another album , Take Your Nibbled Apple Back , which boasted eerie vocal experimentations with female vocals . In 2002 , the MDP recorded a very unexpected single , " Falling in Love / Should I " , which incorporated trip - hop elements , but this was short - lived , since the reviews in British and American press would stress that they are particularly great at playing heavier stuff than Portishead / Sylvian moods . Upon opening its own studio , in 2003 and 2004 , MDP produced a range of events themselves : festivals MindPower , concerts and gigs for other popular Armenian rock - bands . They again play very heavy music , close to sympho - rock , though it is always difficult to describe their music . Recent reviews from OverHook Music tell that they have stylistic resemblance with Dream Theatre , while others recommend to remember Mars Volta . They deservedly attracted attention of German independent promoters and concerted in Dresden in 2005 . Now the band also stands as producer of numerous rock - concerts and rock - festivals in Armenia . Vibrographus Studio , headed by band members , boasts the best hardware in Yerevan for production of rock events . One of the band 's 2008 offspring is the Dogma project , which features female vocals augmented with the band 's bass and guitar .

Richard Harrington of '' The Washington Post '' deemed the song " a powerful exploration of exhaustion and depression . " Alex Pappademas , writing for '' Spin '' , compared the song to the music of Weezer . Katy Kroll of '' Billboard '' recognized it among her top 10 singles of 2000 , calling it " a good old-fashioned depressing song with mainstream flair . " Geoff Boucher , writing for the '' Los Angeles Times '' , called it " a poignant essay on a teen mulling over suicide " ; conversely , Steve Appleford of the '' Los Angeles Times '' dubbed it a " moving if unremarkable examination . " Scott Mervis of the '' Pittsburgh Post-Gazette '' called it a " rare departure from the usual Blink fare . " Writers for '' The A.V. Club '' listed it among other suicide-related songs in 2009 , describing it as " surprisingly affecting , especially when the band reaches the bombastic chorus , and when the song describes suicide 's crushing aftermath . " In a retrospective review , Chris Payne of '' Billboard '' wrote , " Stylistically , it 's also a Blink breakthrough : rather than putting their heads down and plowing through at breakneck speed , the band dials back the verses and interludes to let them breathe a bit . The resulting chorus achieves an arena-worthy feel not achieved anywhere else on '' Enema of the State '' . " The song caused a controversy in 2000 when it was set to replay indefinitely on a nearby stereo as 17-year-old Greg Barnes , a teenager who attended Columbine High School and had lost one of his best friends in the massacre the previous year , hanged himself in the garage of his family 's home . Both Hoppus and DeLonge were sympathetic but stressed the song 's meaning during an MTV News interview in 2001 : Hoppus also told interviewers that he received fan mail following the song 's release from fans that had contemplated suicide , but decided not to go through with it after hearing the song . '' Rolling Stone '' compared the controversy to that of Ozzy Osbourne 's " Suicide Solution " , which similarly was playing as a teen committed suicide

                CONTEXT=Betrayal is the secondary theme of '' The Wild Bunch '' . The characters suffer from their knowledge of having betrayed a friend and left him to his fate , thus violating their own honor code when it suits them ( " $ 10,000 cuts an awful lot of family ties " ) . However , Bishop says , " When you side with a man , you stay with him , and if you ca n't do that you 're like some animal . " Such oppositional ideas lead to the film 's violent conclusion , as the remaining men find their abandonment of Angel intolerable . Bishop remembers his betrayals , most notably when he deserts Deke Thornton ( in flashback ) when the law catches up to them and when he abandons Crazy Lee at the railroad office after the robbery ( ostensibly to guard the hostages ) . Critic David Weddle writes that , " like that of Conrad 's '' Lord Jim '' , Pike Bishop 's heroism is propelled by overwhelming guilt and a despairing death wish . " Vincent Canby began his review by calling the film " very beautiful and the first truly interesting American-made Western in years . It 's also so full of violence — of an intensity that can hardly be supported by the story — that it 's going to prompt a lot of people who do not know the real effect of movie violence ( as I do not ) to write automatic condemnations of it . " He observed , " Although the movie 's conventional and poetic action sequences are extraordinarily good and its landscapes beautifully photographed ... it is most interesting in its almost jolly account of chaos , corruption , and defeat " . About the actors , he commented particularly on William Holden : " After years of giving bored performances in boring movies , Holden comes back gallantly in '' The Wild Bunch '' . He looks older and tired , but he has style , both as a man and as a movie character who persists in doing what he 's always done , not because he really wants the money but because there 's simply nothing else to do . " '' TIME '' also liked Holden 's performance , describing it as his best since '' Stalag 17 '' ( a 1953 film that earned Holden an Oscar ) , noting Robert Ryan gave " the screen performance of his career " , and concluding that " '' The Wild Bunch '' contains faults and mistakes " ( such as flashbacks " introduced with surprising clumsiness " ) , but " its accomplishments are more than sufficient to confirm that Peckinpah , along with Stanley Kubrick and Arthur Penn , belongs with the best of the newer generation of American filmmakers . " In a 2002 retrospective Roger Ebert , who " saw the original version at the world premiere in 1969 , during the golden age of the junket , when Warner Bros. screened five of its new films in the Bahamas for 450 critics and reporters " , said that back then he had publicly declared the film a masterpiece during the junket 's press conference , prompted by comments from " a reporter from the '' Reader 's Digest '' who got up to ask ' Why was this film ever made ? ' " He compared the film to '' Pulp Fiction '' : " praised and condemned with equal vehemence . " " What '' Citizen Kane '' was to movie lovers in 1941 , '' The Wild Bunch '' was to cineastes in 1969 , " wrote film critic Michael Sragow , who added that Peckinpah had " produced an American movie that equals or surpasses the best of Kurosawa : the Gotterdammerung of Westerns "

He also questioned the purpose of the " Year of the Woman " theme writing , " The Oscar show itself seemed at odds with its own feminist theme . " Robert Bianco from the '' Pittsburgh Post-Gazette '' derided Allen 's musical production numbers , comparing them to the disastrous opening number at the 61st ceremony held in 1989 . Columnist Matt Roush of '' USA Today '' complained , " Crystal , in a by-now-familiar performance , has , in four years , taken a plum assignment and , by repetition , reduced it to shtick . " He also wrote that , " The song medley is getting old hat , " and the " smug references to his flop '' Mr. Saturday Night '' were out of an improv amateur night . " The telecast also received unfavorable reaction from various public feminist figures . In an interview with '' Los Angeles Daily News '' author and activist Betty Friedan condemned the " Year of the Woman " theme commenting , " It had no basis in reality . On behalf of women directors , cinematographer , and producers , I resent the travesty of calling that a tribute . " Likewise , President of the National Organization for Women 's Los Angeles chapter Tammy Bruce chastised ceremony 's feminist tribute as " one of the most hypocritical , patronizing things I saw in my whole life . " In response , Gil Cates responded towards the criticism of the theme stating , " The theme developed and raised consciousness in a way that I think is positive , not only for the individual in general but for individual women specifically . " He also quoted an ancient Chinese proverb later made famous by former U.S. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt saying , " It is better to light one candle than to curse the darkness " Despite the adverse reception , the ABC broadcast drew in an average of 45.7 million people over its length , which was a 3 % increase from the previous year 's ceremony . The show also drew higher Nielsen ratings compared to the previous ceremony with 31.2 % of households watching over a 51 share . It also drew a higher 18 – 49 demo rating with a 20.1 rating among viewers in that demographic

After Selena 's death , Lannert wrote a retrospective article on the singer for '' Billboard '' released on 10 June 1995 , he called " Donde Quiera Que Estés " a " pop duet smash " .

Its 14 minutes consisted of a number of scenes depicting Tate filming '' Eye of the Devil '' , dancing in nightclubs , and sightseeing around London , and also contained a brief interview with her . Asked about her acting ambitions , she replied , " I do n't fool myself . I ca n't see myself doing Shakespeare . " She spoke of her hopes of finding a niche in comedy , and in other interviews she expressed her desire to become " a light comedienne in the Carole Lombard style " . She discussed the type of contemporary actress she wanted to emulate and explained that there were two in particular that she was influenced by : Faye Dunaway and Catherine Deneuve . Of the latter , she said , " I 'd like to be an American Catherine Deneuve . She plays beautiful , sensitive , deep parts with a little bit of intelligence behind them . " Later in the year , '' Valley of the Dolls '' opened to almost uniformly negative reviews . Bosley Crowther wrote in '' The New York Times '' , " all a fairly respectful admirer of movies can do is laugh at it and turn away " . '' Newsweek '' said that the film " has no more sense of its own ludicrousness than a village idiot stumbling in manure " , but a later article read : " Astoundingly photogenic , infinitely curvaceous , Sharon Tate is one of the most smashing young things to hit Hollywood in a long time . " The three lead actresses were castigated in numerous publications , including '' The Saturday Review '' , which wrote , " Ten years ago ... Parkins , Duke , and Tate would more likely have been playing the hat check girls than movie-queens ; they are totally lacking in style , authority , or charm . " '' The Hollywood Reporter '' provided some positive comments , such as , " Sharon Tate emerges as the film 's most sympathetic character ... William H. Daniels ' photographic caress of her faultless face and enormous absorbent eyes is stunning . " Roger Ebert of the '' Chicago Sun-Times '' praised Tate as " a wonder to behold " , but after describing the dialogue in one scene as " the most offensive and appalling vulgarity ever thrown up by any civilization " , concluded that , " I will be unable to take her any more seriously as a sex symbol than Raquel Welch . " In late 1967 , Tate and Polanski returned to London and were frequent subjects of newspaper and magazine articles . Tate was depicted as being untraditional and modern , and was quoted as saying couples should live together before marrying . They were married in Chelsea , London , on January 20 , 1968 , with considerable publicity . Polanski was dressed in what the press described as " Edwardian finery " , while Tate was attired in a white minidress . The couple moved into Polanski 's mews house off Eaton Square in Belgravia , London . Photographer Peter Evans later described them as " the imperfect couple . They were the Douglas Fairbanks/Mary Pickford of our time ... Cool , nomadic , talented , and nicely shocking . " While Tate reportedly wanted a traditional marriage , Polanski remained somewhat promiscuous and described Tate 's attitude to his infidelity as " Sharon 's big hang-up " . He reminded Tate that she had promised that she would not try to change him . Tate accepted Polanski 's conditions , though she confided to friends that she hoped he would change . Peter Evans quoted Tate as saying , " We have a good arrangement . Roman lies to me and I pretend to believe him . " Polanski urged Tate to end her association with Martin Ransohoff , and Tate began to place less importance on her career until Polanski told her he wanted to be married to " a hippie , not a housewife . " The couple returned to Los Angeles and quickly became part of a social group that included some of the most successful young people in the film industry , including Warren Beatty , Jacqueline Bisset , Leslie Caron , Joan Collins , Mia Farrow , Jane Fonda , Peter Fonda , Laurence Harvey , Steve McQueen , Joanna Pettet and Peter Sellers ; older film stars like Yul Brynner , Kirk Douglas , Henry Fonda and Danny Kaye ; musicians such as Jim Morrison and The Mamas & the Papas ; and record producer Terry Melcher and his girlfriend , actress Candice Bergen . Jay Sebring remained one of the couple 's more frequent companions . Polanski 's circle of friends included people he had known since his youth in Poland such as Wojciech Frykowski and Frykowski 's girlfriend , coffee heiress Abigail Folger . Tate and Polanski moved into the Chateau Marmont Hotel in Los Angeles for a few months until they arranged to lease Patty Duke 's home on Summit Ridge Drive in Beverly Hills during the latter part of 1968 . The Polanski house was often full of strangers , and Tate regarded the casual atmosphere as part of the " free spirit " of the times , saying that she did not mind who came into her home as her motto was " live and let live . " Her close friend Leslie Caron later commented that the Polanskis were too trusting — " to the point of recklessness " — and that she had been alarmed by it

                CONTEXT=Betrayal is the secondary theme of '' The Wild Bunch '' . The characters suffer from their knowledge of having betrayed a friend and left him to his fate , thus violating their own honor code when it suits them ( " $ 10,000 cuts an awful lot of family ties " ) . However , Bishop says , " When you side with a man , you stay with him , and if you ca n't do that you 're like some animal . " Such oppositional ideas lead to the film 's violent conclusion , as the remaining men find their abandonment of Angel intolerable . Bishop remembers his betrayals , most notably when he deserts Deke Thornton ( in flashback ) when the law catches up to them and when he abandons Crazy Lee at the railroad office after the robbery ( ostensibly to guard the hostages ) . Critic David Weddle writes that , " like that of Conrad 's '' Lord Jim '' , Pike Bishop 's heroism is propelled by overwhelming guilt and a despairing death wish . " Vincent Canby began his review by calling the film " very beautiful and the first truly interesting American-made Western in years . It 's also so full of violence — of an intensity that can hardly be supported by the story — that it 's going to prompt a lot of people who do not know the real effect of movie violence ( as I do not ) to write automatic condemnations of it . " He observed , " Although the movie 's conventional and poetic action sequences are extraordinarily good and its landscapes beautifully photographed ... it is most interesting in its almost jolly account of chaos , corruption , and defeat " . About the actors , he commented particularly on William Holden : " After years of giving bored performances in boring movies , Holden comes back gallantly in '' The Wild Bunch '' . He looks older and tired , but he has style , both as a man and as a movie character who persists in doing what he 's always done , not because he really wants the money but because there 's simply nothing else to do . " '' TIME '' also liked Holden 's performance , describing it as his best since '' Stalag 17 '' ( a 1953 film that earned Holden an Oscar ) , noting Robert Ryan gave " the screen performance of his career " , and concluding that " '' The Wild Bunch '' contains faults and mistakes " ( such as flashbacks " introduced with surprising clumsiness " ) , but " its accomplishments are more than sufficient to confirm that Peckinpah , along with Stanley Kubrick and Arthur Penn , belongs with the best of the newer generation of American filmmakers . " In a 2002 retrospective Roger Ebert , who " saw the original version at the world premiere in 1969 , during the golden age of the junket , when Warner Bros. screened five of its new films in the Bahamas for 450 critics and reporters " , said that back then he had publicly declared the film a masterpiece during the junket 's press conference , prompted by comments from " a reporter from the '' Reader 's Digest '' who got up to ask ' Why was this film ever made ?

                CONTEXT=The show received a negative reception from most media publications . Associated Press television critic Frazier Moore lamented that Crystal " seemed incredibly listless " . He also questioned the purpose of the " Year of the Woman " theme writing , " The Oscar show itself seemed at odds with its own feminist theme . " Robert Bianco from the '' Pittsburgh Post-Gazette '' derided Allen 's musical production numbers , comparing them to the disastrous opening number at the 61st ceremony held in 1989 . Columnist Matt Roush of '' USA Today '' complained , " Crystal , in a by-now-familiar performance , has , in four years , taken a plum assignment and , by repetition , reduced it to shtick . " He also wrote that , " The song medley is getting old hat , " and the " smug references to his flop '' Mr. Saturday Night '' were out of an improv amateur night . " The telecast also received unfavorable reaction from various public feminist figures . In an interview with '' Los Angeles Daily News '' author and activist Betty Friedan condemned the " Year of the Woman " theme commenting , " It had no basis in reality . On behalf of women directors , cinematographer , and producers , I resent the travesty of calling that a tribute . " Likewise , President of the National Organization for Women 's Los Angeles chapter Tammy Bruce chastised ceremony 's feminist tribute as " one of the most hypocritical , patronizing things I saw in my whole life . " In response , Gil Cates responded towards the criticism of the theme stating , " The theme developed and raised consciousness in a way that I think is positive , not only for the individual in general but for individual women specifically . " He also quoted an ancient Chinese proverb later made famous by former U.S. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt saying , " It is better to light one candle than to curse the darkness " Despite the adverse reception , the ABC broadcast drew in an average of 45.7 million people over its length , which was a 3 % increase from the previous year 's ceremony . The show also drew higher Nielsen ratings compared to the previous ceremony with 31.2 % of households watching over a 51 share . It also drew a higher 18 – 49 demo rating with a 20.1 rating among viewers in that demographic

Heretofore , their albums featured a distinctive " No Synthesisers ! " sleeve note . The note is widely assumed to reflect an anti-synth , pro- " hard " - rock stance by the band , but was later revealed by producer Roy Thomas Baker to be an attempt to clarify that those albums ' multi-layered solos were created with guitars , not synths , as record company executives kept assuming at the time . In September 1980 , Queen performed three sold-out shows at Madison Square Garden . In 1980 , Queen also released the soundtrack they had recorded for '' Flash Gordon '' .

                CONTEXT=" Adam 's Song " is generally considered one of the band 's more serious songs , one " that hints at the emotional maturity they 'd show on later releases , " particularly their eponymous 2003 release . Richard Harrington of '' The Washington Post '' deemed the song " a powerful exploration of exhaustion and depression . " Alex Pappademas , writing for '' Spin '' , compared the song to the music of Weezer . Katy Kroll of '' Billboard '' recognized it among her top 10 singles of 2000 , calling it " a good old-fashioned depressing song with mainstream flair . " Geoff Boucher , writing for the '' Los Angeles Times '' , called it " a poignant essay on a teen mulling over suicide " ; conversely , Steve Appleford of the '' Los Angeles Times '' dubbed it a " moving if unremarkable examination . " Scott Mervis of the '' Pittsburgh Post-Gazette '' called it a " rare departure from the usual Blink fare . " Writers for '' The A.V. Club '' listed it among other suicide-related songs in 2009 , describing it as " surprisingly affecting , especially when the band reaches the bombastic chorus , and when the song describes suicide 's crushing aftermath . " In a retrospective review , Chris Payne of '' Billboard '' wrote , " Stylistically , it 's also a Blink breakthrough : rather than putting their heads down and plowing through at breakneck speed , the band dials back the verses and interludes to let them breathe a bit . The resulting chorus achieves an arena-worthy feel not achieved anywhere else on '' Enema of the State '' . " The song caused a controversy in 2000 when it was set to replay indefinitely on a nearby stereo as 17-year-old Greg Barnes , a teenager who attended Columbine High School and had lost one of his best friends in the massacre the previous year , hanged himself in the garage of his family 's home . Both Hoppus and DeLonge were sympathetic but stressed the song 's meaning during an MTV News interview in 2001 : Hoppus also told interviewers that he received fan mail following the song 's release from fans that had contemplated suicide , but decided not to go through with it after hearing the song . '' Rolling Stone '' compared the controversy to that of Ozzy Osbourne 's " Suicide Solution " , which similarly was playing as a teen committed suicide

                CONTEXT=Nambassa significantly expanded the concept of multiple open air staging , all running simultaneously at the one event . Out of the first 1978 three-day festival , the requirement of a second stage grew from the need to expand the entertainment program because of the resounding feedback from local performers and artists wanting to play at Nambassa . This became the " Aerial Railway " , a second fully operational stage with sound , lighting and management . Aerial Railway absorbed the overflow of performers from the Main Stage , and also acted as a venue for spontaneous performances or raves . This second option was integral to the Nambassa philosophy of promoting local music and arts . Although the Miami Pop Festival in December 1968 featured two simultaneous ' main ' stages , most of the early U.S. and European rock festivals , including Woodstock festival , Monterey Pop Festival and Isle of Wight Festival were predominantly single stage productions . The Nambassa 1978 festival had three stages ; 1979 saw this expanded to four ( including workshop stages ) , and the 1981 5-day celebration heralded five separate sound and lighting venues , all running at the same time . In 1981 , " Aerial Railway " was replaced with the " Open Air Theatre " and " Woozlebub " for children . The multiple staging concepts seem to be finally making a comeback in the 21st century as seen at the recent Big Day Out and Glastonbury festivals

" '' Consequence of Sound '' editor Nina Corcoran wrote : " when combined with one of Lamar ’s hottest verses to date ( before '' To Pimp a Butterfly '' ) , the song explodes . But it does n’t stop there . FlyLo shows off his talent by shifting gears post-Kendrick verse the only way you can : insane keys , double-time bass drum , and unrelenting hand claps .

This was true in 2009 when she debuted on '' Glee '' as Rachel Berry and it 's even clearer in 2014 .

Still , it 's a solid effort that shows she has promise as a bonafide pop artist . " Sarah Rodman of '' The Boston Globe '' gave the album a mostly positive review , writing , " The Broadway veteran puts her mighty soprano through its paces on bouncy dance tracks , soaring ballads , and midtempo pop tunes where she straddles the line , mostly comfortably , between Katy Perry and Celine Dion . " Kyle Anderson of '' Entertainment Weekly '' gave the album a B - , writing , " It 's hard to be that mad at '' Louder '' , because it 's so admirably and lovingly crafted . There 's nothing wrong with Lea Michele 's debut , and that 's its biggest problem . While well curated and exquisitely executed , '' Louder '' is missing the visceral oomph that defines the gulf between superstars and the rest of the top 40 chum . " At '' USA Today '' , Jerry Shriver rated the album 2.5 stars out of four , and stated that " softer would have been a better approach . " He added that the song " Battlefield " points to a more promising direction . Kevin McFarland of '' The A.V. Club '' gave a C - rating , writing , " '' Louder '' , Michele 's debut solo album under her own name , does feature her distinctive talent as a vocalist . But the record is caught in an unfortunate stylistic limbo between fun-loving , youthful pop and the maturity of adult contemporary artists . " Jim Farber of the '' New York Daily News '' awarded the album two stars . He criticized , " Michele does n't so much sing as trumpet like an elephant eager for the charge . Her voice has more need than vulnerability , more anger than understanding . " Christopher R. Weingarten of '' Rolling Stone '' also gave a negative review , stating , " This album of insta-dated EDM-pop anthems and half-cocked bass drops probably wo n't help Michele 's cause . The songs about love 's ups and downs have a few memorable lyrics ( ' My heart 's too drunk to drive ' ) but not nearly enough .

                CONTEXT=Justin Timberlake and Chris Stapleton first collaborated at the 2015 Country Music Association Awards , performing " Tennessee Whiskey " and " Drink You Away " . Stapleton was initially only writing songs with Timberlake for the album , before being asked to sing on " Say Something " . He told '' Billboard '' , " I really just went out to Los Angeles to write songs with him , it 's a very fluid process with him , there 's a lot going on . That was one of those things where there was n't necessarily a plan . He was like ' All right , you hop in there and take a verse , ' and I 'm like , ' You want me to do what ? ' ... It came out great . I had a blast with him , he 's a great creative force and one of those guys that if you get a chance to work with him , you should . " " Say Something " is an upbeat country rock ballad that blends the electronic structures of '' Man of the Woods '' previously released songs " Filthy " and " Supplies " with Stapleton 's country blues styles . The song comprises elements of gospel , pop , acoustic soul and jazz . Timberlake and Timbaland previously incorporated country sounds such as twangy guitars on tracks like " What Goes Around ... Comes Around " . The song features lyrics about reflection and regret , meditating on social pressure to have something to say and being unsure if you really do . '' Nashville Scene '' writer Stephen Trageser interpreted the lyrics as : Directed by Arturo Perez Jr. and produced by La Blogothèque , the video was filmed using a technique known as " continuous motion " and shot in one take at the Bradbury Building in Los Angeles – famous for its appearance in the 1982 cult science fiction film '' Blade Runner '' – with elevators , balconies , and stairs that " personified the labyrinth " the concept required . The crew included 17 musicians and a 60-person choir , in order to record the video and audio live in only one take . The video starts with Timberlake alone in a room creating beats and effects on an MPC sampler . The camera follows him as he straps on an acoustic guitar and ascends up an elevator . Stepping out , he encounters Stapleton on a nearby staircase . The music video on YouTube has received over 315 million views as of July 2019 .

                CONTEXT=Nambassa significantly expanded the concept of multiple open air staging , all running simultaneously at the one event . Out of the first 1978 three-day festival , the requirement of a second stage grew from the need to expand the entertainment program because of the resounding feedback from local performers and artists wanting to play at Nambassa . This became the " Aerial Railway " , a second fully operational stage with sound , lighting and management . Aerial Railway absorbed the overflow of performers from the Main Stage , and also acted as a venue for spontaneous performances or raves . This second option was integral to the Nambassa philosophy of promoting local music and arts . Although the Miami Pop Festival in December 1968 featured two simultaneous ' main ' stages , most of the early U.S. and European rock festivals , including Woodstock festival , Monterey Pop Festival and Isle of Wight Festival were predominantly single stage productions . The Nambassa 1978 festival had three stages ; 1979 saw this expanded to four ( including workshop stages ) , and the 1981 5-day celebration heralded five separate sound and lighting venues , all running at the same time . In 1981 , " Aerial Railway " was replaced with the " Open Air Theatre " and " Woozlebub " for children . The multiple staging concepts seem to be finally making a comeback in the 21st century as seen at the recent Big Day Out and Glastonbury festivals

                CONTEXT=Living Stage Theatre Company was a theatre for social change founded in 1966 by Robert A. Alexander ( 1929 – 2008 ) . He served as the artistic director until 1995 . Located in Washington , D.C. , this professional improvisational theater offered participatory workshops to children , youth , teachers , parents , and community members . Living Stage ’s main philosophy was based in the belief that every one is born an artist and the act of creation is the ultimate act of self - affirmation . The company 's mission was to transform individuals and communities through creative empowerment . The projects that the Living Stage put on typically dealt with controversial and sensitive topics like race , economic inequality , the dangers of an overzealous American foreign policy , the atom bomb , violence , and freedom . The " Baltimore Incident " of 1971 is an excellent example of how controversial these productions could be . No matter how mixed opinions were , the Living Stage always elicited a reaction with their improvisational performances . During the 1980s the Living Stage began to reach out extensively to local initiatives like The District 's Alcohol and Drug Abuse Services Administration and created their own Community Services Project in order to continue to bring theater and creativity to underserved sections of society . The Living Stage championed New Left ideals like equality and social justice throughout the Reagan years , despite some criticisms about their message being " anachronistic " . The Living Stage dissolved after 36 years and was a venture of Arena Stage .

The Martians would dispel it after each use with jets of steam , leaving only a residual , " cindery " black powder , which reminds the narrator of what he " read of the destruction of Pompeii " . The smoke is very dense , and can be avoided by climbing to higher places . Although Wells never explains the smoke 's mechanism in the novel , he mentions that it may bind with argon to become toxic . In reality , argon can not combine with other elements , with the marginal exception of fluorine , but chemical weapons were widely used in human warfare after Wells ' novel was written , especially in World War I

" Also noting the eclectic mix of musical genres , '' The Ringer '' writes that " the bombastic tunes mix EDM gleams with stadium-rock grunts , chest-pounding ballads with peppy empowerment anthems , a thoroughly modern and disconcertingly eager post-genre assault designed to barnstorm as many Spotify playlists as possible . It 's a gilded cheese ball , pushing exhilaration to the point of exhaustion . " '' The Guardian '' wrote that the album brought " a whole lot of self-empowerment , enlivened with some deracinated R&B beats , and given the necessary gravitas by some power ballads of the sort that make one imagine the singer filmed from below with a wind machine blowing in their face . " Keala Settle performed " This Is Me " live on '' The Graham Norton Show '' on February 9 , 2018 . Later she performed on '' The Ellen DeGeneres Show '' on February 21 , 2018 .

Heretofore , their albums featured a distinctive " No Synthesisers ! " sleeve note . The note is widely assumed to reflect an anti-synth , pro- " hard " - rock stance by the band , but was later revealed by producer Roy Thomas Baker to be an attempt to clarify that those albums ' multi-layered solos were created with guitars , not synths , as record company executives kept assuming at the time . In September 1980 , Queen performed three sold-out shows at Madison Square Garden . In 1980 , Queen also released the soundtrack they had recorded for '' Flash Gordon '' .

                CONTEXT=Living Stage Theatre Company was a theatre for social change founded in 1966 by Robert A. Alexander ( 1929 – 2008 ) . He served as the artistic director until 1995 . Located in Washington , D.C. , this professional improvisational theater offered participatory workshops to children , youth , teachers , parents , and community members . Living Stage ’s main philosophy was based in the belief that every one is born an artist and the act of creation is the ultimate act of self - affirmation . The company 's mission was to transform individuals and communities through creative empowerment . The projects that the Living Stage put on typically dealt with controversial and sensitive topics like race , economic inequality , the dangers of an overzealous American foreign policy , the atom bomb , violence , and freedom . The " Baltimore Incident " of 1971 is an excellent example of how controversial these productions could be . No matter how mixed opinions were , the Living Stage always elicited a reaction with their improvisational performances . During the 1980s the Living Stage began to reach out extensively to local initiatives like The District 's Alcohol and Drug Abuse Services Administration and created their own Community Services Project in order to continue to bring theater and creativity to underserved sections of society . The Living Stage championed New Left ideals like equality and social justice throughout the Reagan years , despite some criticisms about their message being " anachronistic " . The Living Stage dissolved after 36 years and was a venture of Arena Stage .

                CONTEXT=Crop Over is a traditional harvest festival which began in Barbados , having had its early beginnings on the sugar cane plantations during slavery . The original crop - over tradition began in 1687 as a way to mark the end of the yearly harvest , but was wide - spread throughout the region at the time , including in St. Vincent , Trinidad and Jamaica . As such , it still shares similarities with Carnival in Brazil and Trinidad . Many crop - over celebrations were organized and sponsored by planters , who used gifts of food and liquor as a means of reenforcing and excusing the continued enslavement of their labour force . However , slaves would also have often unsanctioned fetes that featured singing , dancing and accompaniment by bottles filled with water , shak - shak , banjo , triangle , fiddle , guitar , and bones that were more in keeping with their ancestral culture . Other traditions that were later added included climbing a greased pole , feasting and drinking competitions . However , with the harsh effects of World War II on Barbados , these annual celebrations came to an end . The Crop Over Festival was first launched on June 1 , 1970 , but was not officially called a festival until 4 years later .

                CONTEXT=Living Stage Theatre Company was a theatre for social change founded in 1966 by Robert A. Alexander ( 1929 – 2008 ) . He served as the artistic director until 1995 . Located in Washington , D.C. , this professional improvisational theater offered participatory workshops to children , youth , teachers , parents , and community members . Living Stage ’s main philosophy was based in the belief that every one is born an artist and the act of creation is the ultimate act of self - affirmation . The company 's mission was to transform individuals and communities through creative empowerment . The projects that the Living Stage put on typically dealt with controversial and sensitive topics like race , economic inequality , the dangers of an overzealous American foreign policy , the atom bomb , violence , and freedom . The " Baltimore Incident " of 1971 is an excellent example of how controversial these productions could be . No matter how mixed opinions were , the Living Stage always elicited a reaction with their improvisational performances . During the 1980s the Living Stage began to reach out extensively to local initiatives like The District 's Alcohol and Drug Abuse Services Administration and created their own Community Services Project in order to continue to bring theater and creativity to underserved sections of society . The Living Stage championed New Left ideals like equality and social justice throughout the Reagan years , despite some criticisms about their message being " anachronistic " . The Living Stage dissolved after 36 years and was a venture of Arena Stage .

                CONTEXT=Nambassa significantly expanded the concept of multiple open air staging , all running simultaneously at the one event . Out of the first 1978 three-day festival , the requirement of a second stage grew from the need to expand the entertainment program because of the resounding feedback from local performers and artists wanting to play at Nambassa . This became the " Aerial Railway " , a second fully operational stage with sound , lighting and management . Aerial Railway absorbed the overflow of performers from the Main Stage , and also acted as a venue for spontaneous performances or raves . This second option was integral to the Nambassa philosophy of promoting local music and arts . Although the Miami Pop Festival in December 1968 featured two simultaneous ' main ' stages , most of the early U.S. and European rock festivals , including Woodstock festival , Monterey Pop Festival and Isle of Wight Festival were predominantly single stage productions . The Nambassa 1978 festival had three stages ; 1979 saw this expanded to four ( including workshop stages ) , and the 1981 5-day celebration heralded five separate sound and lighting venues , all running at the same time . In 1981 , " Aerial Railway " was replaced with the " Open Air Theatre " and " Woozlebub " for children . The multiple staging concepts seem to be finally making a comeback in the 21st century as seen at the recent Big Day Out and Glastonbury festivals

It featured the singles " Crazy Little Thing Called Love " and " Another One Bites the Dust " , both of which reached number one in the US . After attending a Queen concert in Los Angeles , Michael Jackson suggested to Mercury backstage that " Another One Bites the Dust " be released as a single , and in October 1980 it spent three weeks at number one . The album topped the '' Billboard '' 200 for five weeks , and sold over four million copies in the US . It was also the first appearance of a synthesiser on a Queen album . Heretofore , their albums featured a distinctive " No Synthesisers ! " sleeve note . The note is widely assumed to reflect an anti-synth , pro- " hard " - rock stance by the band , but was later revealed by producer Roy Thomas Baker to be an attempt to clarify that those albums ' multi-layered solos were created with guitars , not synths , as record company executives kept assuming at the time . In September 1980 , Queen performed three sold-out shows at Madison Square Garden . In 1980 , Queen also released the soundtrack they had recorded for '' Flash Gordon '' . At the 1981 American Music Awards in January , " Another One Bites the Dust " won the award for Favorite Pop/Rock Single , and Queen were nominated for Favorite Pop/Rock Band , Duo , or Group

'' Billboard '' clarified that she was still in the process of recording it in Los Angeles . They later posted a 50-second snippet of an instrumental which media claimed was from Madonna , but the sample was traced back to Dutch DJ Sander Kleinenberg and his song " We Are Superstars " .

                CONTEXT=Living Stage Theatre Company was a theatre for social change founded in 1966 by Robert A. Alexander ( 1929 – 2008 ) . He served as the artistic director until 1995 . Located in Washington , D.C. , this professional improvisational theater offered participatory workshops to children , youth , teachers , parents , and community members . Living Stage ’s main philosophy was based in the belief that every one is born an artist and the act of creation is the ultimate act of self - affirmation . The company 's mission was to transform individuals and communities through creative empowerment . The projects that the Living Stage put on typically dealt with controversial and sensitive topics like race , economic inequality , the dangers of an overzealous American foreign policy , the atom bomb , violence , and freedom . The " Baltimore Incident " of 1971 is an excellent example of how controversial these productions could be . No matter how mixed opinions were , the Living Stage always elicited a reaction with their improvisational performances . During the 1980s the Living Stage began to reach out extensively to local initiatives like The District 's Alcohol and Drug Abuse Services Administration and created their own Community Services Project in order to continue to bring theater and creativity to underserved sections of society . The Living Stage championed New Left ideals like equality and social justice throughout the Reagan years , despite some criticisms about their message being " anachronistic " . The Living Stage dissolved after 36 years and was a venture of Arena Stage .

                CONTEXT=The '' All Eyes on Sharon Tate '' documentary was used to publicize the film . Its 14 minutes consisted of a number of scenes depicting Tate filming '' Eye of the Devil '' , dancing in nightclubs , and sightseeing around London , and also contained a brief interview with her . Asked about her acting ambitions , she replied , " I do n't fool myself . I ca n't see myself doing Shakespeare . " She spoke of her hopes of finding a niche in comedy , and in other interviews she expressed her desire to become " a light comedienne in the Carole Lombard style " . She discussed the type of contemporary actress she wanted to emulate and explained that there were two in particular that she was influenced by : Faye Dunaway and Catherine Deneuve . Of the latter , she said , " I 'd like to be an American Catherine Deneuve . She plays beautiful , sensitive , deep parts with a little bit of intelligence behind them . " Later in the year , '' Valley of the Dolls '' opened to almost uniformly negative reviews . Bosley Crowther wrote in '' The New York Times '' , " all a fairly respectful admirer of movies can do is laugh at it and turn away " . '' Newsweek '' said that the film " has no more sense of its own ludicrousness than a village idiot stumbling in manure " , but a later article read : " Astoundingly photogenic , infinitely curvaceous , Sharon Tate is one of the most smashing young things to hit Hollywood in a long time . " The three lead actresses were castigated in numerous publications , including '' The Saturday Review '' , which wrote , " Ten years ago ... Parkins , Duke , and Tate would more likely have been playing the hat check girls than movie-queens ; they are totally lacking in style , authority , or charm . " '' The Hollywood Reporter '' provided some positive comments , such as , " Sharon Tate emerges as the film 's most sympathetic character ... William H. Daniels ' photographic caress of her faultless face and enormous absorbent eyes is stunning . " Roger Ebert of the '' Chicago Sun-Times '' praised Tate as " a wonder to behold " , but after describing the dialogue in one scene as " the most offensive and appalling vulgarity ever thrown up by any civilization " , concluded that , " I will be unable to take her any more seriously as a sex symbol than Raquel Welch . " In late 1967 , Tate and Polanski returned to London and were frequent subjects of newspaper and magazine articles . Tate was depicted as being untraditional and modern , and was quoted as saying couples should live together before marrying . They were married in Chelsea , London , on January 20 , 1968 , with considerable publicity . Polanski was dressed in what the press described as " Edwardian finery " , while Tate was attired in a white minidress . The couple moved into Polanski 's mews house off Eaton Square in Belgravia , London . Photographer Peter Evans later described them as " the imperfect couple . They were the Douglas Fairbanks/Mary Pickford of our time ... Cool , nomadic , talented , and nicely shocking . " While Tate reportedly wanted a traditional marriage , Polanski remained somewhat promiscuous and described Tate 's attitude to his infidelity as " Sharon 's big hang-up " . He reminded Tate that she had promised that she would not try to change him . Tate accepted Polanski 's conditions , though she confided to friends that she hoped he would change . Peter Evans quoted Tate as saying , " We have a good arrangement . Roman lies to me and I pretend to believe him . " Polanski urged Tate to end her association with Martin Ransohoff , and Tate began to place less importance on her career until Polanski told her he wanted to be married to " a hippie , not a housewife . " The couple returned to Los Angeles and quickly became part of a social group that included some of the most successful young people in the film industry , including Warren Beatty , Jacqueline Bisset , Leslie Caron , Joan Collins , Mia Farrow , Jane Fonda , Peter Fonda , Laurence Harvey , Steve McQueen , Joanna Pettet and Peter Sellers ; older film stars like Yul Brynner , Kirk Douglas , Henry Fonda and Danny Kaye ; musicians such as Jim Morrison and The Mamas & the Papas ; and record producer Terry Melcher and his girlfriend , actress Candice Bergen . Jay Sebring remained one of the couple 's more frequent companions . Polanski 's circle of friends included people he had known since his youth in Poland such as Wojciech Frykowski and Frykowski 's girlfriend , coffee heiress Abigail Folger . Tate and Polanski moved into the Chateau Marmont Hotel in Los Angeles for a few months until they arranged to lease Patty Duke 's home on Summit Ridge Drive in Beverly Hills during the latter part of 1968 . The Polanski house was often full of strangers , and Tate regarded the casual atmosphere as part of the " free spirit " of the times , saying that she did not mind who came into her home as her motto was " live and let live . " Her close friend Leslie Caron later commented that the Polanskis were too trusting — " to the point of recklessness " — and that she had been alarmed by it

                CONTEXT=Betrayal is the secondary theme of '' The Wild Bunch '' . The characters suffer from their knowledge of having betrayed a friend and left him to his fate , thus violating their own honor code when it suits them ( " $ 10,000 cuts an awful lot of family ties " ) . However , Bishop says , " When you side with a man , you stay with him , and if you ca n't do that you 're like some animal . " Such oppositional ideas lead to the film 's violent conclusion , as the remaining men find their abandonment of Angel intolerable . Bishop remembers his betrayals , most notably when he deserts Deke Thornton ( in flashback ) when the law catches up to them and when he abandons Crazy Lee at the railroad office after the robbery ( ostensibly to guard the hostages ) . Critic David Weddle writes that , " like that of Conrad 's '' Lord Jim '' , Pike Bishop 's heroism is propelled by overwhelming guilt and a despairing death wish . " Vincent Canby began his review by calling the film " very beautiful and the first truly interesting American-made Western in years . It 's also so full of violence — of an intensity that can hardly be supported by the story — that it 's going to prompt a lot of people who do not know the real effect of movie violence ( as I do not ) to write automatic condemnations of it . " He observed , " Although the movie 's conventional and poetic action sequences are extraordinarily good and its landscapes beautifully photographed ... it is most interesting in its almost jolly account of chaos , corruption , and defeat " . About the actors , he commented particularly on William Holden : " After years of giving bored performances in boring movies , Holden comes back gallantly in '' The Wild Bunch '' . He looks older and tired , but he has style , both as a man and as a movie character who persists in doing what he 's always done , not because he really wants the money but because there 's simply nothing else to do . " '' TIME '' also liked Holden 's performance , describing it as his best since '' Stalag 17 '' ( a 1953 film that earned Holden an Oscar ) , noting Robert Ryan gave " the screen performance of his career " , and concluding that " '' The Wild Bunch '' contains faults and mistakes " ( such as flashbacks " introduced with surprising clumsiness " ) , but " its accomplishments are more than sufficient to confirm that Peckinpah , along with Stanley Kubrick and Arthur Penn , belongs with the best of the newer generation of American filmmakers . " In a 2002 retrospective Roger Ebert , who " saw the original version at the world premiere in 1969 , during the golden age of the junket , when Warner Bros. screened five of its new films in the Bahamas for 450 critics and reporters " , said that back then he had publicly declared the film a masterpiece during the junket 's press conference , prompted by comments from " a reporter from the '' Reader 's Digest '' who got up to ask ' Why was this film ever made ? ' " He compared the film to '' Pulp Fiction '' : " praised and condemned with equal vehemence . " " What '' Citizen Kane '' was to movie lovers in 1941 , '' The Wild Bunch '' was to cineastes in 1969 , " wrote film critic Michael Sragow , who added that Peckinpah had " produced an American movie that equals or surpasses the best of Kurosawa : the Gotterdammerung of Westerns "

By February 23 , 2018 , the track " This Is Me " was nominated for Best Original Song at the 2018 Academy Awards . According to Sky News on March 25 , 2018 , " music critics have put the album 's success down to the feel-good , uplifting pop tunes which are also old school at the same time . " Sheila O'Malley of RogerEbert.com called the 11 songs " memorable , " praising the vocal performances of the leads . The women 's magazine '' Bustle '' gave it a positive review , particularly certain vocal performances . '' Stereogum '' described the soundtrack music as eclectic in its influences , giving it a negative reception for " serving up earnest buoyancy in many high-fructose flavors . " Also noting the eclectic mix of musical genres , '' The Ringer '' writes that " the bombastic tunes mix EDM gleams with stadium-rock grunts , chest-pounding ballads with peppy empowerment anthems , a thoroughly modern and disconcertingly eager post-genre assault designed to barnstorm as many Spotify playlists as possible . It 's a gilded cheese ball , pushing exhilaration to the point of exhaustion . " '' The Guardian '' wrote that the album brought " a whole lot of self-empowerment , enlivened with some deracinated R&B beats , and given the necessary gravitas by some power ballads of the sort that make one imagine the singer filmed from below with a wind machine blowing in their face . " Keala Settle performed " This Is Me " live on '' The Graham Norton Show '' on February 9 , 2018 . Later she performed on '' The Ellen DeGeneres Show '' on February 21 , 2018 .

No matter how mixed opinions were , the Living Stage always elicited a reaction with their improvisational performances . During the 1980s the Living Stage began to reach out extensively to local initiatives like The District 's Alcohol and Drug Abuse Services Administration and created their own Community Services Project in order to continue to bring theater and creativity to underserved sections of society . The Living Stage championed New Left ideals like equality and social justice throughout the Reagan years , despite some criticisms about their message being " anachronistic " .

                CONTEXT=The '' All Eyes on Sharon Tate '' documentary was used to publicize the film . Its 14 minutes consisted of a number of scenes depicting Tate filming '' Eye of the Devil '' , dancing in nightclubs , and sightseeing around London , and also contained a brief interview with her . Asked about her acting ambitions , she replied , " I do n't fool myself . I ca n't see myself doing Shakespeare . " She spoke of her hopes of finding a niche in comedy , and in other interviews she expressed her desire to become " a light comedienne in the Carole Lombard style " . She discussed the type of contemporary actress she wanted to emulate and explained that there were two in particular that she was influenced by : Faye Dunaway and Catherine Deneuve . Of the latter , she said , " I 'd like to be an American Catherine Deneuve . She plays beautiful , sensitive , deep parts with a little bit of intelligence behind them . " Later in the year , '' Valley of the Dolls '' opened to almost uniformly negative reviews . Bosley Crowther wrote in '' The New York Times '' , " all a fairly respectful admirer of movies can do is laugh at it and turn away " . '' Newsweek '' said that the film " has no more sense of its own ludicrousness than a village idiot stumbling in manure " , but a later article read : " Astoundingly photogenic , infinitely curvaceous , Sharon Tate is one of the most smashing young things to hit Hollywood in a long time . " The three lead actresses were castigated in numerous publications , including '' The Saturday Review '' , which wrote , " Ten years ago ... Parkins , Duke , and Tate would more likely have been playing the hat check girls than movie-queens ; they are totally lacking in style , authority , or charm . " '' The Hollywood Reporter '' provided some positive comments , such as , " Sharon Tate emerges as the film 's most sympathetic character ... William H. Daniels ' photographic caress of her faultless face and enormous absorbent eyes is stunning . " Roger Ebert of the '' Chicago Sun-Times '' praised Tate as " a wonder to behold " , but after describing the dialogue in one scene as " the most offensive and appalling vulgarity ever thrown up by any civilization " , concluded that , " I will be unable to take her any more seriously as a sex symbol than Raquel Welch . " In late 1967 , Tate and Polanski returned to London and were frequent subjects of newspaper and magazine articles . Tate was depicted as being untraditional and modern , and was quoted as saying couples should live together before marrying . They were married in Chelsea , London , on January 20 , 1968 , with considerable publicity . Polanski was dressed in what the press described as " Edwardian finery " , while Tate was attired in a white minidress . The couple moved into Polanski 's mews house off Eaton Square in Belgravia , London . Photographer Peter Evans later described them as " the imperfect couple . They were the Douglas Fairbanks/Mary Pickford of our time ... Cool , nomadic , talented , and nicely shocking . " While Tate reportedly wanted a traditional marriage , Polanski remained somewhat promiscuous and described Tate 's attitude to his infidelity as " Sharon 's big hang-up " . He reminded Tate that she had promised that she would not try to change him . Tate accepted Polanski 's conditions , though she confided to friends that she hoped he would change . Peter Evans quoted Tate as saying , " We have a good arrangement . Roman lies to me and I pretend to believe him . " Polanski urged Tate to end her association with Martin Ransohoff , and Tate began to place less importance on her career until Polanski told her he wanted to be married to " a hippie , not a housewife . " The couple returned to Los Angeles and quickly became part of a social group that included some of the most successful young people in the film industry , including Warren Beatty , Jacqueline Bisset , Leslie Caron , Joan Collins , Mia Farrow , Jane Fonda , Peter Fonda , Laurence Harvey , Steve McQueen , Joanna Pettet and Peter Sellers ; older film stars like Yul Brynner , Kirk Douglas , Henry Fonda and Danny Kaye ; musicians such as Jim Morrison and The Mamas & the Papas ; and record producer Terry Melcher and his girlfriend , actress Candice Bergen . Jay Sebring remained one of the couple 's more frequent companions . Polanski 's circle of friends included people he had known since his youth in Poland such as Wojciech Frykowski and Frykowski 's girlfriend , coffee heiress Abigail Folger . Tate and Polanski moved into the Chateau Marmont Hotel in Los Angeles for a few months until they arranged to lease Patty Duke 's home on Summit Ridge Drive in Beverly Hills during the latter part of 1968 . The Polanski house was often full of strangers , and Tate regarded the casual atmosphere as part of the " free spirit " of the times , saying that she did not mind who came into her home as her motto was " live and let live . " Her close friend Leslie Caron later commented that the Polanskis were too trusting — " to the point of recklessness " — and that she had been alarmed by it

He also questioned the purpose of the " Year of the Woman " theme writing , " The Oscar show itself seemed at odds with its own feminist theme . " Robert Bianco from the '' Pittsburgh Post-Gazette '' derided Allen 's musical production numbers , comparing them to the disastrous opening number at the 61st ceremony held in 1989 . Columnist Matt Roush of '' USA Today '' complained , " Crystal , in a by-now-familiar performance , has , in four years , taken a plum assignment and , by repetition , reduced it to shtick . " He also wrote that , " The song medley is getting old hat , " and the " smug references to his flop '' Mr. Saturday Night '' were out of an improv amateur night . " The telecast also received unfavorable reaction from various public feminist figures . In an interview with '' Los Angeles Daily News '' author and activist Betty Friedan condemned the " Year of the Woman " theme commenting , " It had no basis in reality . On behalf of women directors , cinematographer , and producers , I resent the travesty of calling that a tribute . " Likewise , President of the National Organization for Women 's Los Angeles chapter Tammy Bruce chastised ceremony 's feminist tribute as " one of the most hypocritical , patronizing things I saw in my whole life . " In response , Gil Cates responded towards the criticism of the theme stating , " The theme developed and raised consciousness in a way that I think is positive , not only for the individual in general but for individual women specifically . " He also quoted an ancient Chinese proverb later made famous by former U.S. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt saying , " It is better to light one candle than to curse the darkness " Despite the adverse reception , the ABC broadcast drew in an average of 45.7 million people over its length , which was a 3 % increase from the previous year 's ceremony . The show also drew higher Nielsen ratings compared to the previous ceremony with 31.2 % of households watching over a 51 share . It also drew a higher 18 – 49 demo rating with a 20.1 rating among viewers in that demographic

                CONTEXT=The '' All Eyes on Sharon Tate '' documentary was used to publicize the film . Its 14 minutes consisted of a number of scenes depicting Tate filming '' Eye of the Devil '' , dancing in nightclubs , and sightseeing around London , and also contained a brief interview with her . Asked about her acting ambitions , she replied , " I do n't fool myself . I ca n't see myself doing Shakespeare . " She spoke of her hopes of finding a niche in comedy , and in other interviews she expressed her desire to become " a light comedienne in the Carole Lombard style " . She discussed the type of contemporary actress she wanted to emulate and explained that there were two in particular that she was influenced by : Faye Dunaway and Catherine Deneuve . Of the latter , she said , " I 'd like to be an American Catherine Deneuve . She plays beautiful , sensitive , deep parts with a little bit of intelligence behind them . " Later in the year , '' Valley of the Dolls '' opened to almost uniformly negative reviews . Bosley Crowther wrote in '' The New York Times '' , " all a fairly respectful admirer of movies can do is laugh at it and turn away " . '' Newsweek '' said that the film " has no more sense of its own ludicrousness than a village idiot stumbling in manure " , but a later article read : " Astoundingly photogenic , infinitely curvaceous , Sharon Tate is one of the most smashing young things to hit Hollywood in a long time . " The three lead actresses were castigated in numerous publications , including '' The Saturday Review '' , which wrote , " Ten years ago ... Parkins , Duke , and Tate would more likely have been playing the hat check girls than movie-queens ; they are totally lacking in style , authority , or charm . " '' The Hollywood Reporter '' provided some positive comments , such as , " Sharon Tate emerges as the film 's most sympathetic character ... William H. Daniels ' photographic caress of her faultless face and enormous absorbent eyes is stunning . " Roger Ebert of the '' Chicago Sun-Times '' praised Tate as " a wonder to behold " , but after describing the dialogue in one scene as " the most offensive and appalling vulgarity ever thrown up by any civilization " , concluded that , " I will be unable to take her any more seriously as a sex symbol than Raquel Welch . " In late 1967 , Tate and Polanski returned to London and were frequent subjects of newspaper and magazine articles . Tate was depicted as being untraditional and modern , and was quoted as saying couples should live together before marrying . They were married in Chelsea , London , on January 20 , 1968 , with considerable publicity . Polanski was dressed in what the press described as " Edwardian finery " , while Tate was attired in a white minidress . The couple moved into Polanski 's mews house off Eaton Square in Belgravia , London . Photographer Peter Evans later described them as " the imperfect couple . They were the Douglas Fairbanks/Mary Pickford of our time ... Cool , nomadic , talented , and nicely shocking . " While Tate reportedly wanted a traditional marriage , Polanski remained somewhat promiscuous and described Tate 's attitude to his infidelity as " Sharon 's big hang-up " . He reminded Tate that she had promised that she would not try to change him . Tate accepted Polanski 's conditions , though she confided to friends that she hoped he would change . Peter Evans quoted Tate as saying , " We have a good arrangement . Roman lies to me and I pretend to believe him . " Polanski urged Tate to end her association with Martin Ransohoff , and Tate began to place less importance on her career until Polanski told her he wanted to be married to " a hippie , not a housewife . " The couple returned to Los Angeles and quickly became part of a social group that included some of the most successful young people in the film industry , including Warren Beatty , Jacqueline Bisset , Leslie Caron , Joan Collins , Mia Farrow , Jane Fonda , Peter Fonda , Laurence Harvey , Steve McQueen , Joanna Pettet and Peter Sellers ; older film stars like Yul Brynner , Kirk Douglas , Henry Fonda and Danny Kaye ; musicians such as Jim Morrison and The Mamas & the Papas ; and record producer Terry Melcher and his girlfriend , actress Candice Bergen . Jay Sebring remained one of the couple 's more frequent companions . Polanski 's circle of friends included people he had known since his youth in Poland such as Wojciech Frykowski and Frykowski 's girlfriend , coffee heiress Abigail Folger . Tate and Polanski moved into the Chateau Marmont Hotel in Los Angeles for a few months until they arranged to lease Patty Duke 's home on Summit Ridge Drive in Beverly Hills during the latter part of 1968 . The Polanski house was often full of strangers , and Tate regarded the casual atmosphere as part of the " free spirit " of the times , saying that she did not mind who came into her home as her motto was " live and let live . " Her close friend Leslie Caron later commented that the Polanskis were too trusting — " to the point of recklessness " — and that she had been alarmed by it

Named Best New Track by '' Pitchfork Media '' , editor Jayson Greene praised Lamar 's performance , writing " his hyper-vaulting flow and embedded rhyme patterns within rhyme patterns " . For its year-end list of " The 100 Best Tracks of 2014 " , '' Pitchfork '' ranked the song at number 23 . Also commenting on Lamar , '' Billboard '' 's Chris Payne wrote , " There are n't many A-list rappers who could handle a beat like this , but Kendrick is clearly one of them . " '' Rolling Stone '' editor Jon Dolan gave the song three-and-a-half out of five stars , commenting " Over offhandedly lovely , warp-speed psychedelic soul-jazz , Lamar unleashes a word-mad waterfall with a worried emotional core ( " analyze my demise I say I 'm super-anxious " , he raps ) . " '' Consequence of Sound '' editor Nina Corcoran wrote : " when combined with one of Lamar ’s hottest verses to date ( before '' To Pimp a Butterfly '' ) , the song explodes . But it does n’t stop there . FlyLo shows off his talent by shifting gears post-Kendrick verse the only way you can : insane keys , double-time bass drum , and unrelenting hand claps . Eventually , it ’s all swallowed up in massive swelling synth and choral hums , fading to a beautiful , passionate outro . " Directed by Hiro Murai , the video begins at a funeral ( including attendees Flying Lotus and Thundercat in cameo roles ) . Seemingly a sad video , it turns instantly joyful when the two late children - a boy and a girl - bound out of their caskets at the front of the church and dance gleefully down the aisle . The mourners ca n't see the children as they dance right out of the church and out onto a blacktop , but a group of other kids chases after them as they hop in a hearse and drive away .

The season was to be a promising one , filled with All - Star talent at several positions . It was believed over the offseason , the Suns would be able to better incorporate Shaquille O'Neal , who necessitated changes to both the offense and defense after being obtained in a trade one season ago . It was also the first season head coach Terry Porter had been able to use the summer to implement his defensive approach for a team which had in seasons past scored a large number of their points off fast breaks and early in the shot clock .

                CONTEXT=The '' All Eyes on Sharon Tate '' documentary was used to publicize the film . Its 14 minutes consisted of a number of scenes depicting Tate filming '' Eye of the Devil '' , dancing in nightclubs , and sightseeing around London , and also contained a brief interview with her . Asked about her acting ambitions , she replied , " I do n't fool myself . I ca n't see myself doing Shakespeare . " She spoke of her hopes of finding a niche in comedy , and in other interviews she expressed her desire to become " a light comedienne in the Carole Lombard style " . She discussed the type of contemporary actress she wanted to emulate and explained that there were two in particular that she was influenced by : Faye Dunaway and Catherine Deneuve . Of the latter , she said , " I 'd like to be an American Catherine Deneuve . She plays beautiful , sensitive , deep parts with a little bit of intelligence behind them . " Later in the year , '' Valley of the Dolls '' opened to almost uniformly negative reviews . Bosley Crowther wrote in '' The New York Times '' , " all a fairly respectful admirer of movies can do is laugh at it and turn away " . '' Newsweek '' said that the film " has no more sense of its own ludicrousness than a village idiot stumbling in manure " , but a later article read : " Astoundingly photogenic , infinitely curvaceous , Sharon Tate is one of the most smashing young things to hit Hollywood in a long time . " The three lead actresses were castigated in numerous publications , including '' The Saturday Review '' , which wrote , " Ten years ago ... Parkins , Duke , and Tate would more likely have been playing the hat check girls than movie-queens ; they are totally lacking in style , authority , or charm . " '' The Hollywood Reporter '' provided some positive comments , such as , " Sharon Tate emerges as the film 's most sympathetic character ... William H. Daniels ' photographic caress of her faultless face and enormous absorbent eyes is stunning . " Roger Ebert of the '' Chicago Sun-Times '' praised Tate as " a wonder to behold " , but after describing the dialogue in one scene as " the most offensive and appalling vulgarity ever thrown up by any civilization " , concluded that , " I will be unable to take her any more seriously as a sex symbol than Raquel Welch . " In late 1967 , Tate and Polanski returned to London and were frequent subjects of newspaper and magazine articles . Tate was depicted as being untraditional and modern , and was quoted as saying couples should live together before marrying . They were married in Chelsea , London , on January 20 , 1968 , with considerable publicity . Polanski was dressed in what the press described as " Edwardian finery " , while Tate was attired in a white minidress . The couple moved into Polanski 's mews house off Eaton Square in Belgravia , London . Photographer Peter Evans later described them as " the imperfect couple . They were the Douglas Fairbanks/Mary Pickford of our time ... Cool , nomadic , talented , and nicely shocking . " While Tate reportedly wanted a traditional marriage , Polanski remained somewhat promiscuous and described Tate 's attitude to his infidelity as " Sharon 's big hang-up " . He reminded Tate that she had promised that she would not try to change him . Tate accepted Polanski 's conditions , though she confided to friends that she hoped he would change . Peter Evans quoted Tate as saying , " We have a good arrangement . Roman lies to me and I pretend to believe him . " Polanski urged Tate to end her association with Martin Ransohoff , and Tate began to place less importance on her career until Polanski told her he wanted to be married to " a hippie , not a housewife . " The couple returned to Los Angeles and quickly became part of a social group that included some of the most successful young people in the film industry , including Warren Beatty , Jacqueline Bisset , Leslie Caron , Joan Collins , Mia Farrow , Jane Fonda , Peter Fonda , Laurence Harvey , Steve McQueen , Joanna Pettet and Peter Sellers ; older film stars like Yul Brynner , Kirk Douglas , Henry Fonda and Danny Kaye ; musicians such as Jim Morrison and The Mamas & the Papas ; and record producer Terry Melcher and his girlfriend , actress Candice Bergen . Jay Sebring remained one of the couple 's more frequent companions . Polanski 's circle of friends included people he had known since his youth in Poland such as Wojciech Frykowski and Frykowski 's girlfriend , coffee heiress Abigail Folger . Tate and Polanski moved into the Chateau Marmont Hotel in Los Angeles for a few months until they arranged to lease Patty Duke 's home on Summit Ridge Drive in Beverly Hills during the latter part of 1968 . The Polanski house was often full of strangers , and Tate regarded the casual atmosphere as part of the " free spirit " of the times , saying that she did not mind who came into her home as her motto was " live and let live . " Her close friend Leslie Caron later commented that the Polanskis were too trusting — " to the point of recklessness " — and that she had been alarmed by it

Heretofore , their albums featured a distinctive " No Synthesisers ! " sleeve note . The note is widely assumed to reflect an anti-synth , pro- " hard " - rock stance by the band , but was later revealed by producer Roy Thomas Baker to be an attempt to clarify that those albums ' multi-layered solos were created with guitars , not synths , as record company executives kept assuming at the time . In September 1980 , Queen performed three sold-out shows at Madison Square Garden . In 1980 , Queen also released the soundtrack they had recorded for '' Flash Gordon '' . At the 1981 American Music Awards in January , " Another One Bites the Dust " won the award for Favorite Pop/Rock Single , and Queen were nominated for Favorite Pop/Rock Band , Duo , or Group

Published in 1970 by Parents ' Magazine Press , the book tells the story of a penniless Army veteran , Benito Badoglio , who becomes rich after he unwittingly gains possession of a magic flying top hat . The book is richly illustrated and the text contains numerous vivid and mellifluous descriptions and dialog . For example , upon meeting the top hat , the protagonist cries , " Thunder of Sebastopole ! " ; in another scene , he shouts , " A thousand Potemkins ! " Other characters in the book are " cutthroats " , " brigands " , a " fainting contessa " , and a " dashing cadet " . The author 's interest in such colorful prose was explained by Selma G. Lanes in the Atlantic Monthly : " Ungerer feels strongly that children enjoy unfamiliar words and euphonious , mystifying phrases . " The setting for The Hat is nineteenth century Italy , and was described by Sydney D. Long in the Horn Book Magazine as " a never - never land ... , the comic - opera pictures of The Hat are full of mandolin - playing musicians , splashing fountains , and apple - cheeked peasant lasses .

Led by singer Ray Brown , they ranked alongside the Easybeats , Billy Thorpe & the Aztecs and Normie Rowe as one of the most popular acts of the period . In 1964 , the band played at the Bowl , a Sydney nightclub , doing covers of popular songs such as " Shakin All Over " . The group performed regularly in front of thousands of excitable teenagers who danced wildly to the sounds and energy provided by these new pop heroes . It was inevitable that the clean - cut and personable Brown would stand as the equal of Normie and Stevie Wright as a pin - up sensation . Over a frantic period of two years , Brown and the Whispers issued four excellent albums , seven hits singles and eight EPs . Indeed , their remarkable run of four Top 5 hits in a row – including three # 1s in " 20 Miles " , " Pride " and " Fool , Fool , Fool " - in hometown Sydney during 1965 alone proved to be a milestone in local pop music history . Other highlights include the gritty garage rockers " ( Ai n't It ) Strange " and " That 's Evil " , the moody " Too Late to Come Home " ( with the Bee Gees on backing vocals ) , the chiming " Go to Him " , laden with electric 12 - sting guitar , and tremendous covers of soul staples " In the Midnight Hour " and " Respect " .

He also questioned the purpose of the " Year of the Woman " theme writing , " The Oscar show itself seemed at odds with its own feminist theme . " Robert Bianco from the '' Pittsburgh Post-Gazette '' derided Allen 's musical production numbers , comparing them to the disastrous opening number at the 61st ceremony held in 1989 . Columnist Matt Roush of '' USA Today '' complained , " Crystal , in a by-now-familiar performance , has , in four years , taken a plum assignment and , by repetition , reduced it to shtick . " He also wrote that , " The song medley is getting old hat , " and the " smug references to his flop '' Mr. Saturday Night '' were out of an improv amateur night . " The telecast also received unfavorable reaction from various public feminist figures . In an interview with '' Los Angeles Daily News '' author and activist Betty Friedan condemned the " Year of the Woman " theme commenting , " It had no basis in reality . On behalf of women directors , cinematographer , and producers , I resent the travesty of calling that a tribute . " Likewise , President of the National Organization for Women 's Los Angeles chapter Tammy Bruce chastised ceremony 's feminist tribute as " one of the most hypocritical , patronizing things I saw in my whole life . " In response , Gil Cates responded towards the criticism of the theme stating , " The theme developed and raised consciousness in a way that I think is positive , not only for the individual in general but for individual women specifically . " He also quoted an ancient Chinese proverb later made famous by former U.S. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt saying , " It is better to light one candle than to curse the darkness " Despite the adverse reception , the ABC broadcast drew in an average of 45.7 million people over its length , which was a 3 % increase from the previous year 's ceremony . The show also drew higher Nielsen ratings compared to the previous ceremony with 31.2 % of households watching over a 51 share .

Thirteen other prominent Christian and Jewish women , including the social worker Belle Moskowitz , made up the Society 's first Board of Directors . The Travelers Aid Society 's purpose was to provide social work to women traveling alone in order to protect them from moral danger . The TAS - NY believed that the greatest threat to female travelers in the early twentieth century was white slave trafficking , defined as the coercion of " white " women into prostitution and their subsequent sale to procurers or male clients . Agents of the Travelers Aid Society patrolled Grand Central Terminal and Pennsylvania Station , as well as the city 's piers where transatlantic ocean liners docked , looking for women who they identified as vulnerable . Services usually entailed safely escorting women , immigrant and native - born alike , to city addresses , other transportation lines , or to a temporary lodging home , such as the YWCA . The TAS - NY 's first headquarters was a four - story row house located a short walk from Grand Central Terminal at 238 East 48th St in the Turtle Bay neighborhood .

                CONTEXT=Although traditionally Titus Andronicus has been seen as one of Shakespeare 's least respected plays , its fortunes have changed somewhat in the latter half of the twentieth century , with numerous scholars arguing that the play is more accomplished than has hitherto been allowed for . In particular , scholars have argued that the play is far more thematically complex than has traditionally been thought , and features profound insights into ancient Rome , Elizabethan society , and the human condition . Such scholars tend to argue that these previously unacknowledged insights have only become apparent during the twentieth and twenty - first centuries as only now has the ultraviolent content of the play achieved a sense of relevance . For example , in his 1987 edition of the play for the Contemporary Shakespeare series , A.L. Rowse writes ; " in the civilised Victorian age the play could not be performed because it could not be believed . Such is the horror of our own age , with the appalling barbarities of prison camps and resistance movements paralleling the torture and mutilation and feeding on human flesh of the play , that it has ceased to be improbable . " Similarly , director Julie Taymor , who staged a production Off - Broadway in 1994 and directed a film version in 1999 , says she was drawn to the play because she found it to be the most " relevant of Shakespeare 's plays for the modern era ; " She feels that the play has more relevance for us than it had for the Victorians ; " it seems like a play written for today , it reeks of now . " Because of this new found relevance , previously unrecognised thematic strands have thus come to the forefront .

Don was credited with being able to vocalise eight German words , including haben ( “ have ” ) , Kuchen ( “ cake ” ) , Hunger ( “ hunger ” ) , and his own name . Don also learned to say ja ( “ yes ” ) , nein ( “ no ” ) , and Ruhe ( “ quiet ” or “ rest ” ) along with the name of his owner and his owner 's fiancé . In April 1911 The Salt Lake Tribune reported that Don had been examined by “ a number of the most eminent zoologists ” and that they had declared him “ a genuine prodigy ” . The journal Science reported in May 1912 that Don 's ability to speak was more down to “ the production of sounds which produce illusions in the hearer ” .

He also questioned the purpose of the " Year of the Woman " theme writing , " The Oscar show itself seemed at odds with its own feminist theme . " Robert Bianco from the '' Pittsburgh Post-Gazette '' derided Allen 's musical production numbers , comparing them to the disastrous opening number at the 61st ceremony held in 1989 . Columnist Matt Roush of '' USA Today '' complained , " Crystal , in a by-now-familiar performance , has , in four years , taken a plum assignment and , by repetition , reduced it to shtick . " He also wrote that , " The song medley is getting old hat , " and the " smug references to his flop '' Mr. Saturday Night '' were out of an improv amateur night . " The telecast also received unfavorable reaction from various public feminist figures . In an interview with '' Los Angeles Daily News '' author and activist Betty Friedan condemned the " Year of the Woman " theme commenting , " It had no basis in reality . On behalf of women directors , cinematographer , and producers , I resent the travesty of calling that a tribute . " Likewise , President of the National Organization for Women 's Los Angeles chapter Tammy Bruce chastised ceremony 's feminist tribute as " one of the most hypocritical , patronizing things I saw in my whole life . " In response , Gil Cates responded towards the criticism of the theme stating , " The theme developed and raised consciousness in a way that I think is positive , not only for the individual in general but for individual women specifically . " He also quoted an ancient Chinese proverb later made famous by former U.S. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt saying , " It is better to light one candle than to curse the darkness " Despite the adverse reception , the ABC broadcast drew in an average of 45.7 million people over its length , which was a 3 % increase from the previous year 's ceremony . The show also drew higher Nielsen ratings compared to the previous ceremony with 31.2 % of households watching over a 51 share . It also drew a higher 18 – 49 demo rating with a 20.1 rating among viewers in that demographic

Of the title characters , critic Roger Ebert said : " Their influence will forever change the lives of their students , and we can see that coming from the opening frame " , and that '' The Chorus '' " should have added something new and unexpected " . Ebert also commented that " This feels more like a Hollywood wannabe than a French film .

                CONTEXT=Betrayal is the secondary theme of '' The Wild Bunch '' . The characters suffer from their knowledge of having betrayed a friend and left him to his fate , thus violating their own honor code when it suits them ( " $ 10,000 cuts an awful lot of family ties " ) . However , Bishop says , " When you side with a man , you stay with him , and if you ca n't do that you 're like some animal . " Such oppositional ideas lead to the film 's violent conclusion , as the remaining men find their abandonment of Angel intolerable . Bishop remembers his betrayals , most notably when he deserts Deke Thornton ( in flashback ) when the law catches up to them and when he abandons Crazy Lee at the railroad office after the robbery ( ostensibly to guard the hostages ) . Critic David Weddle writes that , " like that of Conrad 's '' Lord Jim '' , Pike Bishop 's heroism is propelled by overwhelming guilt and a despairing death wish . " Vincent Canby began his review by calling the film " very beautiful and the first truly interesting American-made Western in years . It 's also so full of violence — of an intensity that can hardly be supported by the story — that it 's going to prompt a lot of people who do not know the real effect of movie violence ( as I do not ) to write automatic condemnations of it . " He observed , " Although the movie 's conventional and poetic action sequences are extraordinarily good and its landscapes beautifully photographed ... it is most interesting in its almost jolly account of chaos , corruption , and defeat " . About the actors , he commented particularly on William Holden : " After years of giving bored performances in boring movies , Holden comes back gallantly in '' The Wild Bunch '' . He looks older and tired , but he has style , both as a man and as a movie character who persists in doing what he 's always done , not because he really wants the money but because there 's simply nothing else to do . " '' TIME '' also liked Holden 's performance , describing it as his best since '' Stalag 17 '' ( a 1953 film that earned Holden an Oscar ) , noting Robert Ryan gave " the screen performance of his career " , and concluding that " '' The Wild Bunch '' contains faults and mistakes " ( such as flashbacks " introduced with surprising clumsiness " ) , but " its accomplishments are more than sufficient to confirm that Peckinpah , along with Stanley Kubrick and Arthur Penn , belongs with the best of the newer generation of American filmmakers . " In a 2002 retrospective Roger Ebert , who " saw the original version at the world premiere in 1969 , during the golden age of the junket , when Warner Bros. screened five of its new films in the Bahamas for 450 critics and reporters " , said that back then he had publicly declared the film a masterpiece during the junket 's press conference , prompted by comments from " a reporter from the '' Reader 's Digest '' who got up to ask ' Why was this film ever made ? ' " He compared the film to '' Pulp Fiction '' : " praised and condemned with equal vehemence . " " What '' Citizen Kane '' was to movie lovers in 1941 , '' The Wild Bunch '' was to cineastes in 1969 , " wrote film critic Michael Sragow , who added that Peckinpah had " produced an American movie that equals or surpasses the best of Kurosawa : the Gotterdammerung of Westerns "

But it does n’t stop there . FlyLo shows off his talent by shifting gears post-Kendrick verse the only way you can : insane keys , double-time bass drum , and unrelenting hand claps .

Located in Washington , D.C. , this professional improvisational theater offered participatory workshops to children , youth , teachers , parents , and community members . Living Stage ’s main philosophy was based in the belief that every one is born an artist and the act of creation is the ultimate act of self - affirmation . The company 's mission was to transform individuals and communities through creative empowerment . The projects that the Living Stage put on typically dealt with controversial and sensitive topics like race , economic inequality , the dangers of an overzealous American foreign policy , the atom bomb , violence , and freedom . The " Baltimore Incident " of 1971 is an excellent example of how controversial these productions could be . No matter how mixed opinions were , the Living Stage always elicited a reaction with their improvisational performances . During the 1980s the Living Stage began to reach out extensively to local initiatives like The District 's Alcohol and Drug Abuse Services Administration and created their own Community Services Project in order to continue to bring theater and creativity to underserved sections of society . The Living Stage championed New Left ideals like equality and social justice throughout the Reagan years , despite some criticisms about their message being " anachronistic " . The Living Stage dissolved after 36 years and was a venture of Arena Stage .

                CONTEXT=Living Stage Theatre Company was a theatre for social change founded in 1966 by Robert A. Alexander ( 1929 – 2008 ) . He served as the artistic director until 1995 . Located in Washington , D.C. , this professional improvisational theater offered participatory workshops to children , youth , teachers , parents , and community members . Living Stage ’s main philosophy was based in the belief that every one is born an artist and the act of creation is the ultimate act of self - affirmation . The company 's mission was to transform individuals and communities through creative empowerment . The projects that the Living Stage put on typically dealt with controversial and sensitive topics like race , economic inequality , the dangers of an overzealous American foreign policy , the atom bomb , violence , and freedom . The " Baltimore Incident " of 1971 is an excellent example of how controversial these productions could be . No matter how mixed opinions were , the Living Stage always elicited a reaction with their improvisational performances . During the 1980s the Living Stage began to reach out extensively to local initiatives like The District 's Alcohol and Drug Abuse Services Administration and created their own Community Services Project in order to continue to bring theater and creativity to underserved sections of society . The Living Stage championed New Left ideals like equality and social justice throughout the Reagan years , despite some criticisms about their message being " anachronistic " . The Living Stage dissolved after 36 years and was a venture of Arena Stage .

Music UK commented that songs like " Right to Be Wrong " , " Jet Lag " and " Killing Time " " confirm that not only can she deliver pain and passion like a lover three times her age , she can write it like one too . " He continued : " There 's not a bad song here , but there are some that never make it out of the rootsy background . " '' Billboard '' critic Michael Paoletta stated that Stone " continues to reinvent soul music , injecting a very classic sound with contemporary sass and verve " , while noting that " t hroughout , '' that '' voice reigns supreme . " '' The Guardian '' s Caroline Sullivan believed that " this record is best seen as a stepping stone by which she should n't be judged too exactingly . " She also praised Stone 's " ripening " voice , saying it is " foxier " than on '' The Soul Sessions '' . At '' Blender '' magazine , Robert Christgau opined that " this album 's compromise with the teen-pop divahood she was groomed for will feel like a bid for authenticity . Stone 's infatuation with band grooves provides relief from the radio-ready synthesizers and compressors . " Dimitri Ehrlich of '' Vibe '' called the album " deeply refreshing " , adding that " t here 's nothing new here ... but if your ears are inured to the dense , overly polished production of contemporary R&B , Stone 's simplicity and rawness will come as a revelation . " Laura Sinagra of '' Rolling Stone '' wrote , " As on her last album , tasteful retro organs and wah-wah dominate this batch of originals " and named " Spoiled " one of the album 's " strongest moments " , but felt that songs like " Do n't Cha Wan na Ride " and " You Had Me " are " more Destiny 's Child than yesterday 's blues " . In a mixed review , David Browne of '' Entertainment Weekly '' stated , " Save for a mild foray into reggae and a stab at power balladry , the tracks are monotonously midtempo , supper-club soul . " At the 2005 Brit Awards , Stone won the awards for British Female Solo Artist and British Urban Act , and was nominated for British Breakthrough Act , becoming the youngest recipient of a Brit Award at age 17 . That same year , Stone received three nominations at the 47th Annual Grammy Awards , including Best New Artist , Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for " You Had Me " and Best Pop Vocal Album for '' Mind Body & Soul '' . The album earned Stone a nomination for International Newcomer of the Year at Germany 's Echo Awards in 2005

Located in Washington , D.C. , this professional improvisational theater offered participatory workshops to children , youth , teachers , parents , and community members . Living Stage ’s main philosophy was based in the belief that every one is born an artist and the act of creation is the ultimate act of self - affirmation . The company 's mission was to transform individuals and communities through creative empowerment . The projects that the Living Stage put on typically dealt with controversial and sensitive topics like race , economic inequality , the dangers of an overzealous American foreign policy , the atom bomb , violence , and freedom . The " Baltimore Incident " of 1971 is an excellent example of how controversial these productions could be . No matter how mixed opinions were , the Living Stage always elicited a reaction with their improvisational performances . During the 1980s the Living Stage began to reach out extensively to local initiatives like The District 's Alcohol and Drug Abuse Services Administration and created their own Community Services Project in order to continue to bring theater and creativity to underserved sections of society . The Living Stage championed New Left ideals like equality and social justice throughout the Reagan years , despite some criticisms about their message being " anachronistic " . The Living Stage dissolved after 36 years and was a venture of Arena Stage .

In a mixed review , McCaffrey felt that the game does not offer many options of survival , requiring players to spend most of their time hiding in lockers " staring at the motion tracker " . '' Polygon '' criticised the overexposure to the alien creature , turning '' Alien : Isolation '' into an irritating experience . As Gies explained , " Every time I thought I heard the monster , every blip on my motion tracker , was a cause for a tightness in my chest at first . By the 300th time I dived under a table or into a locker , I was n't scared anymore — I was annoyed . " Despite the criticism , '' Alien : Isolation '' was considered a " brave " title due to its difficult and unforgiving gameplay , a feature that is uncommon in games with large development costs . '' Alien : Isolation '' received several year-end awards , including '' PC Gamer '' s Game of the Year 2014 , Audio Achievement at the 11th British Academy Games Awards , Best Audio at the 15th Game Developers Choice Awards , and four awards at the 14th National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers .

                CONTEXT=Betrayal is the secondary theme of '' The Wild Bunch '' . The characters suffer from their knowledge of having betrayed a friend and left him to his fate , thus violating their own honor code when it suits them ( " $ 10,000 cuts an awful lot of family ties " ) . However , Bishop says , " When you side with a man , you stay with him , and if you ca n't do that you 're like some animal . " Such oppositional ideas lead to the film 's violent conclusion , as the remaining men find their abandonment of Angel intolerable . Bishop remembers his betrayals , most notably when he deserts Deke Thornton ( in flashback ) when the law catches up to them and when he abandons Crazy Lee at the railroad office after the robbery ( ostensibly to guard the hostages ) . Critic David Weddle writes that , " like that of Conrad 's '' Lord Jim '' , Pike Bishop 's heroism is propelled by overwhelming guilt and a despairing death wish . " Vincent Canby began his review by calling the film " very beautiful and the first truly interesting American-made Western in years . It 's also so full of violence — of an intensity that can hardly be supported by the story — that it 's going to prompt a lot of people who do not know the real effect of movie violence ( as I do not ) to write automatic condemnations of it . " He observed , " Although the movie 's conventional and poetic action sequences are extraordinarily good and its landscapes beautifully photographed ... it is most interesting in its almost jolly account of chaos , corruption , and defeat " . About the actors , he commented particularly on William Holden : " After years of giving bored performances in boring movies , Holden comes back gallantly in '' The Wild Bunch '' . He looks older and tired , but he has style , both as a man and as a movie character who persists in doing what he 's always done , not because he really wants the money but because there 's simply nothing else to do . " '' TIME '' also liked Holden 's performance , describing it as his best since '' Stalag 17 '' ( a 1953 film that earned Holden an Oscar ) , noting Robert Ryan gave " the screen performance of his career " , and concluding that " '' The Wild Bunch '' contains faults and mistakes " ( such as flashbacks " introduced with surprising clumsiness " ) , but " its accomplishments are more than sufficient to confirm that Peckinpah , along with Stanley Kubrick and Arthur Penn , belongs with the best of the newer generation of American filmmakers . " In a 2002 retrospective Roger Ebert , who " saw the original version at the world premiere in 1969 , during the golden age of the junket , when Warner Bros. screened five of its new films in the Bahamas for 450 critics and reporters " , said that back then he had publicly declared the film a masterpiece during the junket 's press conference , prompted by comments from " a reporter from the '' Reader 's Digest '' who got up to ask ' Why was this film ever made ? ' " He compared the film to '' Pulp Fiction '' : " praised and condemned with equal vehemence . " " What '' Citizen Kane '' was to movie lovers in 1941 , '' The Wild Bunch '' was to cineastes in 1969 , " wrote film critic Michael Sragow , who added that Peckinpah had " produced an American movie that equals or surpasses the best of Kurosawa : the Gotterdammerung of Westerns "

                CONTEXT=Rock journalist Cameron Crowe noted years later : " It was a time of ' super-groups ' , of furiously hyped bands who could barely cut it , and Led Zeppelin initially found themselves fighting upstream to prove their authenticity . " However , press reaction to the album was not entirely negative . In Britain the album received a glowing review in '' Melody Maker '' . Chris Welch wrote , in a review titled " Jimmy Page triumphs – Led Zeppelin is a gas ! " : " their material does not rely on obvious blues riffs , although when they do play them , they avoid the emaciated feebleness of most so-called British blues bands " . In '' Oz '' , Felix Dennis regarded it as one of those rare albums that " defies immediate classification or description , simply because it 's so obviously a turning point in rock music that only time proves capable of shifting it into eventual perspective " . In comparing the record to their follow-up '' Led Zeppelin II '' , Robert Christgau wrote in '' The Village Voice '' that the debut was " subtler and more ambitious musically " , and not as good , " because subtlety defeated the effect . Musicianship , in other words , was really incidental to such music , but the music did have real strength and validity : a combination of showmanship and overwhelming physical force . " The album was a commercial success . It was initially released in the US on 12 January 1969 to capitalise on the band 's first North American concert tour . Before that , Atlantic Records had distributed a few hundred advance white label copies to key radio stations and reviewers . A positive reaction to its contents , coupled with a good reaction to the band 's opening concerts , resulted in the album generating 50,000 advance orders . The album reached number 10 on the '' Billboard '' chart . The album earned its US gold certification in July 1969

                CONTEXT=Music critics favorably reviewed " Never Catch Me " . Named Best New Track by '' Pitchfork Media '' , editor Jayson Greene praised Lamar 's performance , writing " his hyper-vaulting flow and embedded rhyme patterns within rhyme patterns " . For its year-end list of " The 100 Best Tracks of 2014 " , '' Pitchfork '' ranked the song at number 23 . Also commenting on Lamar , '' Billboard '' 's Chris Payne wrote , " There are n't many A-list rappers who could handle a beat like this , but Kendrick is clearly one of them . " '' Rolling Stone '' editor Jon Dolan gave the song three-and-a-half out of five stars , commenting " Over offhandedly lovely , warp-speed psychedelic soul-jazz , Lamar unleashes a word-mad waterfall with a worried emotional core ( " analyze my demise I say I 'm super-anxious " , he raps ) . " '' Consequence of Sound '' editor Nina Corcoran wrote : " when combined with one of Lamar ’s hottest verses to date ( before '' To Pimp a Butterfly '' ) , the song explodes . But it does n’t stop there . FlyLo shows off his talent by shifting gears post-Kendrick verse the only way you can : insane keys , double-time bass drum , and unrelenting hand claps . Eventually , it ’s all swallowed up in massive swelling synth and choral hums , fading to a beautiful , passionate outro . " Directed by Hiro Murai , the video begins at a funeral ( including attendees Flying Lotus and Thundercat in cameo roles ) . Seemingly a sad video , it turns instantly joyful when the two late children - a boy and a girl - bound out of their caskets at the front of the church and dance gleefully down the aisle . The mourners ca n't see the children as they dance right out of the church and out onto a blacktop , but a group of other kids chases after them as they hop in a hearse and drive away . The clip was featured by several publications on their year-end list of best videos , including '' Pitchfork '' , '' Spin '' , and Stereogumwith the latter listing it at number one . The video received two nominations at the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards : Best Choreography and Best Cinematography , ultimately winning the latter

" Robert Bianco from the '' Pittsburgh Post-Gazette '' derided Allen 's musical production numbers , comparing them to the disastrous opening number at the 61st ceremony held in 1989 . Columnist Matt Roush of '' USA Today '' complained , " Crystal , in a by-now-familiar performance , has , in four years , taken a plum assignment and , by repetition , reduced it to shtick . " He also wrote that , " The song medley is getting old hat , " and the " smug references to his flop '' Mr. Saturday Night '' were out of an improv amateur night . " The telecast also received unfavorable reaction from various public feminist figures . In an interview with '' Los Angeles Daily News '' author and activist Betty Friedan condemned the " Year of the Woman " theme commenting , " It had no basis in reality . On behalf of women directors , cinematographer , and producers , I resent the travesty of calling that a tribute . " Likewise , President of the National Organization for Women 's Los Angeles chapter Tammy Bruce chastised ceremony 's feminist tribute as " one of the most hypocritical , patronizing things I saw in my whole life . " In response , Gil Cates responded towards the criticism of the theme stating , " The theme developed and raised consciousness in a way that I think is positive , not only for the individual in general but for individual women specifically . " He also quoted an ancient Chinese proverb later made famous by former U.S. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt saying , " It is better to light one candle than to curse the darkness " Despite the adverse reception , the ABC broadcast drew in an average of 45.7 million people over its length , which was a 3 % increase from the previous year 's ceremony . The show also drew higher Nielsen ratings compared to the previous ceremony with 31.2 % of households watching over a 51 share . It also drew a higher 18 – 49 demo rating with a 20.1 rating among viewers in that demographic

After attending a Queen concert in Los Angeles , Michael Jackson suggested to Mercury backstage that " Another One Bites the Dust " be released as a single , and in October 1980 it spent three weeks at number one .

Heretofore , their albums featured a distinctive " No Synthesisers ! " sleeve note . The note is widely assumed to reflect an anti-synth , pro- " hard " - rock stance by the band , but was later revealed by producer Roy Thomas Baker to be an attempt to clarify that those albums ' multi-layered solos were created with guitars , not synths , as record company executives kept assuming at the time . In September 1980 , Queen performed three sold-out shows at Madison Square Garden . In 1980 , Queen also released the soundtrack they had recorded for '' Flash Gordon '' .

                CONTEXT=Betrayal is the secondary theme of '' The Wild Bunch '' . The characters suffer from their knowledge of having betrayed a friend and left him to his fate , thus violating their own honor code when it suits them ( " $ 10,000 cuts an awful lot of family ties " ) . However , Bishop says , " When you side with a man , you stay with him , and if you ca n't do that you 're like some animal . " Such oppositional ideas lead to the film 's violent conclusion , as the remaining men find their abandonment of Angel intolerable . Bishop remembers his betrayals , most notably when he deserts Deke Thornton ( in flashback ) when the law catches up to them and when he abandons Crazy Lee at the railroad office after the robbery ( ostensibly to guard the hostages ) . Critic David Weddle writes that , " like that of Conrad 's '' Lord Jim '' , Pike Bishop 's heroism is propelled by overwhelming guilt and a despairing death wish . " Vincent Canby began his review by calling the film " very beautiful and the first truly interesting American-made Western in years . It 's also so full of violence — of an intensity that can hardly be supported by the story — that it 's going to prompt a lot of people who do not know the real effect of movie violence ( as I do not ) to write automatic condemnations of it . " He observed , " Although the movie 's conventional and poetic action sequences are extraordinarily good and its landscapes beautifully photographed ... it is most interesting in its almost jolly account of chaos , corruption , and defeat " . About the actors , he commented particularly on William Holden : " After years of giving bored performances in boring movies , Holden comes back gallantly in '' The Wild Bunch '' . He looks older and tired , but he has style , both as a man and as a movie character who persists in doing what he 's always done , not because he really wants the money but because there 's simply nothing else to do . " '' TIME '' also liked Holden 's performance , describing it as his best since '' Stalag 17 '' ( a 1953 film that earned Holden an Oscar ) , noting Robert Ryan gave " the screen performance of his career " , and concluding that " '' The Wild Bunch '' contains faults and mistakes " ( such as flashbacks " introduced with surprising clumsiness " ) , but " its accomplishments are more than sufficient to confirm that Peckinpah , along with Stanley Kubrick and Arthur Penn , belongs with the best of the newer generation of American filmmakers . " In a 2002 retrospective Roger Ebert , who " saw the original version at the world premiere in 1969 , during the golden age of the junket , when Warner Bros. screened five of its new films in the Bahamas for 450 critics and reporters " , said that back then he had publicly declared the film a masterpiece during the junket 's press conference , prompted by comments from " a reporter from the '' Reader 's Digest '' who got up to ask ' Why was this film ever made ? ' " He compared the film to '' Pulp Fiction '' : " praised and condemned with equal vehemence . " " What '' Citizen Kane '' was to movie lovers in 1941 , '' The Wild Bunch '' was to cineastes in 1969 , " wrote film critic Michael Sragow , who added that Peckinpah had " produced an American movie that equals or surpasses the best of Kurosawa : the Gotterdammerung of Westerns "

                CONTEXT=The show received a negative reception from most media publications . Associated Press television critic Frazier Moore lamented that Crystal " seemed incredibly listless " . He also questioned the purpose of the " Year of the Woman " theme writing , " The Oscar show itself seemed at odds with its own feminist theme . " Robert Bianco from the '' Pittsburgh Post-Gazette '' derided Allen 's musical production numbers , comparing them to the disastrous opening number at the 61st ceremony held in 1989 . Columnist Matt Roush of '' USA Today '' complained , " Crystal , in a by-now-familiar performance , has , in four years , taken a plum assignment and , by repetition , reduced it to shtick . " He also wrote that , " The song medley is getting old hat , " and the " smug references to his flop '' Mr. Saturday Night '' were out of an improv amateur night . " The telecast also received unfavorable reaction from various public feminist figures . In an interview with '' Los Angeles Daily News '' author and activist Betty Friedan condemned the " Year of the Woman " theme commenting , " It had no basis in reality . On behalf of women directors , cinematographer , and producers , I resent the travesty of calling that a tribute . " Likewise , President of the National Organization for Women 's Los Angeles chapter Tammy Bruce chastised ceremony 's feminist tribute as " one of the most hypocritical , patronizing things I saw in my whole life . " In response , Gil Cates responded towards the criticism of the theme stating , " The theme developed and raised consciousness in a way that I think is positive , not only for the individual in general but for individual women specifically . " He also quoted an ancient Chinese proverb later made famous by former U.S. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt saying , " It is better to light one candle than to curse the darkness " Despite the adverse reception , the ABC broadcast drew in an average of 45.7 million people over its length , which was a 3 % increase from the previous year 's ceremony . The show also drew higher Nielsen ratings compared to the previous ceremony with 31.2 % of households watching over a 51 share . It also drew a higher 18 – 49 demo rating with a 20.1 rating among viewers in that demographic

                CONTEXT=The '' All Eyes on Sharon Tate '' documentary was used to publicize the film . Its 14 minutes consisted of a number of scenes depicting Tate filming '' Eye of the Devil '' , dancing in nightclubs , and sightseeing around London , and also contained a brief interview with her . Asked about her acting ambitions , she replied , " I do n't fool myself . I ca n't see myself doing Shakespeare . " She spoke of her hopes of finding a niche in comedy , and in other interviews she expressed her desire to become " a light comedienne in the Carole Lombard style " . She discussed the type of contemporary actress she wanted to emulate and explained that there were two in particular that she was influenced by : Faye Dunaway and Catherine Deneuve . Of the latter , she said , " I 'd like to be an American Catherine Deneuve . She plays beautiful , sensitive , deep parts with a little bit of intelligence behind them . " Later in the year , '' Valley of the Dolls '' opened to almost uniformly negative reviews . Bosley Crowther wrote in '' The New York Times '' , " all a fairly respectful admirer of movies can do is laugh at it and turn away " . '' Newsweek '' said that the film " has no more sense of its own ludicrousness than a village idiot stumbling in manure " , but a later article read : " Astoundingly photogenic , infinitely curvaceous , Sharon Tate is one of the most smashing young things to hit Hollywood in a long time . " The three lead actresses were castigated in numerous publications , including '' The Saturday Review '' , which wrote , " Ten years ago ... Parkins , Duke , and Tate would more likely have been playing the hat check girls than movie-queens ; they are totally lacking in style , authority , or charm . " '' The Hollywood Reporter '' provided some positive comments , such as , " Sharon Tate emerges as the film 's most sympathetic character ... William H. Daniels ' photographic caress of her faultless face and enormous absorbent eyes is stunning . " Roger Ebert of the '' Chicago Sun-Times '' praised Tate as " a wonder to behold " , but after describing the dialogue in one scene as " the most offensive and appalling vulgarity ever thrown up by any civilization " , concluded that , " I will be unable to take her any more seriously as a sex symbol than Raquel Welch . " In late 1967 , Tate and Polanski returned to London and were frequent subjects of newspaper and magazine articles . Tate was depicted as being untraditional and modern , and was quoted as saying couples should live together before marrying . They were married in Chelsea , London , on January 20 , 1968 , with considerable publicity . Polanski was dressed in what the press described as " Edwardian finery " , while Tate was attired in a white minidress . The couple moved into Polanski 's mews house off Eaton Square in Belgravia , London . Photographer Peter Evans later described them as " the imperfect couple . They were the Douglas Fairbanks/Mary Pickford of our time ... Cool , nomadic , talented , and nicely shocking . " While Tate reportedly wanted a traditional marriage , Polanski remained somewhat promiscuous and described Tate 's attitude to his infidelity as " Sharon 's big hang-up " . He reminded Tate that she had promised that she would not try to change him . Tate accepted Polanski 's conditions , though she confided to friends that she hoped he would change . Peter Evans quoted Tate as saying , " We have a good arrangement . Roman lies to me and I pretend to believe him . " Polanski urged Tate to end her association with Martin Ransohoff , and Tate began to place less importance on her career until Polanski told her he wanted to be married to " a hippie , not a housewife . " The couple returned to Los Angeles and quickly became part of a social group that included some of the most successful young people in the film industry , including Warren Beatty , Jacqueline Bisset , Leslie Caron , Joan Collins , Mia Farrow , Jane Fonda , Peter Fonda , Laurence Harvey , Steve McQueen , Joanna Pettet and Peter Sellers ; older film stars like Yul Brynner , Kirk Douglas , Henry Fonda and Danny Kaye ; musicians such as Jim Morrison and The Mamas & the Papas ; and record producer Terry Melcher and his girlfriend , actress Candice Bergen . Jay Sebring remained one of the couple 's more frequent companions . Polanski 's circle of friends included people he had known since his youth in Poland such as Wojciech Frykowski and Frykowski 's girlfriend , coffee heiress Abigail Folger . Tate and Polanski moved into the Chateau Marmont Hotel in Los Angeles for a few months until they arranged to lease Patty Duke 's home on Summit Ridge Drive in Beverly Hills during the latter part of 1968 . The Polanski house was often full of strangers , and Tate regarded the casual atmosphere as part of the " free spirit " of the times , saying that she did not mind who came into her home as her motto was " live and let live . " Her close friend Leslie Caron later commented that the Polanskis were too trusting — " to the point of recklessness " — and that she had been alarmed by it

It featured the singles " Crazy Little Thing Called Love " and " Another One Bites the Dust " , both of which reached number one in the US . After attending a Queen concert in Los Angeles , Michael Jackson suggested to Mercury backstage that " Another One Bites the Dust " be released as a single , and in October 1980 it spent three weeks at number one . The album topped the '' Billboard '' 200 for five weeks , and sold over four million copies in the US . It was also the first appearance of a synthesiser on a Queen album . Heretofore , their albums featured a distinctive " No Synthesisers ! " sleeve note . The note is widely assumed to reflect an anti-synth , pro- " hard " - rock stance by the band , but was later revealed by producer Roy Thomas Baker to be an attempt to clarify that those albums ' multi-layered solos were created with guitars , not synths , as record company executives kept assuming at the time . In September 1980 , Queen performed three sold-out shows at Madison Square Garden . In 1980 , Queen also released the soundtrack they had recorded for '' Flash Gordon '' . At the 1981 American Music Awards in January , " Another One Bites the Dust " won the award for Favorite Pop/Rock Single , and Queen were nominated for Favorite Pop/Rock Band , Duo , or Group

                CONTEXT='' The Zookeeper '' is an independent 2001 drama film directed by Ralph Ziman and starring Sam Neill , Gina McKee , and Ulrich Thomsen . It was screened at the 2001 Toronto International Film Festival and the 2001 Fort Lauderdale International Film Festival . In an unspecified Eastern European country , soldiers round up the inhabitants of a village . Ten year old Zioig ( Javor Loznica ) is separated from his mother Ankica ( Gina McKee ) . While being transported in a truck , Ziog 's father ( Mikulás Kren ) tells his son that he is a man now and that grown men do n't cry . The soldiers kill the men but Zioig manages to escape . Meanwhile in the capital city , a former Interior Ministry official and Communist party member named Ludovic ( Sam Neill ) works at a zoo . He receives a letter from his estranged daughter Anna in Paris who wants to reconcile with her father . With the city under siege , Ludovic volunteers to help the Indian veterinary ( Om Puri ) to look after the animals until they can safely evacuate them . Due to scarce supplies , they are forced to put the animals on rations . Elsewhere , the orphaned Zioig is picked up by a truck carrying United Nations peacekeepers . During the journey , he jumps out of the truck while the peacekeepers are asleep and steals two boxes of supplies . Back in the capital city , Ludovic encounters the militia leader Dragov ( Ulrich Thomsen ) at a checkpoint . Despite lacking identity papers , Dragov lets him through because they are of the same race . Ludovic moves into the zoo and helps the veterinary to look after the animals . Ludovic develops an attachment to a female gibbon named " Luisa . " While visiting the wolves ' pen , Ludovic encounters the orphaned Zioig and tells the boy to leave . Amidst the fighting , Ludovic befriends the Vet while drinking . The Vet tells Ludovic that good men do the right thing in bad times . The following morning , Dragov and his militia visit the zoo and arrests the Vet because he is of a different race . When Ludovic protests , Dragov replies that they will let him go if he is innocent . Ludovic is forced to look after the animals alone . The following morning , Ludovic buries a dead man he finds strung up outside . Later , Zioig returns and forces his way into Ludovic 's cabin with a gun . When the boy faints , Ludovic takes pity on him and tends to the boy 's leg wound with antibiotics . After feeding Zioig , Ludovic tells him that he has to leave the next day because his presence would endanger him . Zioig complies but later returns with a woman , who identifies herself as Zioig ’s mother Ankica . Taking pity on them , Ludovic decides to allow Zioig and his mother to stay . After a blood-stained Zioig returns with cigarettes taken from a man he purportedly found dead , Ankica confides in Ludovic that she is losing touch with her son . While at the zoo ’s butchery , Ankica recounts her experiences in a prison camp where she was raped by a guard who used to be her neighbor . Ankica also begs Ludovic to be kind to her son in order to help him . While Ludovic spends time with Zioig , Ankica reads through Ludovic 's diaries . When Dragov and his militia return to seize the farm animals for food , Ludovic hides Ankica inside a barn . While Dragov and one of his men Slavko ( Srdjan Simeonovich ) search the barn , Ludovic distracts them by giving them a lion cub as a mascot . After the militiamen leave , Ankica kisses Ludovic out of gratitude . Ludovic comforts the distraught Zioig , who is troubled by the suffering zoo animals . When Ludovic discovers that Ankica has been reading through his diaries , he angrily orders them to leave . Zioig storms out in a fit of rage . Ludovic and Ankica eventually discover that her son has gunned down the militiaman Slavko . Ankica searches for her son but he avoids her . Returning to the cabin , Ankica and Ludovic reconcile and develop feelings for each other . The following morning , Ludovic feeds the body of the militiaman to a lion . That night , the zoo 's monkey house is hit by artillery . Ludovic tries to rescue the monkeys but they succumb to the flames , smoke , and trauma . After some argument , Ankica convinces Ludovic to leave the zoo with her and her son . Later , Ludovic and Ankica comfort Zioig as he mourns over a wolf killed during the bombardment . Mother and son reconcile while Ludovic imparts fatherly advice to Zioig that grown men do cry . The following morning , Ludovic farewells the animals and prepares to leave the zoo with Zioig and Ankica . However , Ankica is killed by one of Dragov ’s snipers . Ludovic tends to her while Dragov and his militia drive away from the city . As UN peacekeepers enter the city and evacuate the animals , Ludovic and Zioig bury Ankica . They then depart the zoo with the orphaned wolf cub

Scott of '' The New York Times '' describes '' 300 '' as " about as violent as '' Apocalypto '' and twice as stupid , " while criticizing its color scheme and suggesting that its plot includes racist undertones ; Scott also poked fun at the buffed bodies of the actors portraying the Spartans , declaring that the Persian characters are " pioneers in the art of face-piercing " , but that the Spartans had access to " superior health clubs and electrolysis facilities " . Kenneth Turan writes in the '' Los Angeles Times '' that " unless you love violence as much as a Spartan , Quentin Tarantino or a video-game-playing teenage boy , you will not be endlessly fascinated . " Roger Ebert , in his review , gave the film a two-star rating , writing , " '' 300 '' has one-dimensional caricatures who talk like professional wrestlers plugging their next feud . " Some critics employed at Greek newspapers have been particularly critical , such as film critic Robby Eksiel , who said that moviegoers would be dazzled by the " digital action " but irritated by the " pompous interpretations and one-dimensional characters . " '' Variety '' Todd McCarthy describes the film as " visually arresting " although " bombastic " while Kirk Honeycutt , writing in '' The Hollywood Reporter '' , praises the " beauty of its topography , colors and forms . " Writing in the '' Chicago Sun Times '' , Richard Roeper acclaims '' 300 '' as " the '' Citizen Kane '' of cinematic graphic novels . " '' Empire '' gave the film 3 out of 5 having a verdict of " Visually stunning , thoroughly belligerent and as shallow as a pygmy 's paddling pool , this is a whole heap of style tinged with just a smidgen of substance .

                CONTEXT=Grand Theft Auto V is an open world , action - adventure video game developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games . Upon its release for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on 17 September 2013 , the game generated controversies related to its violence and depiction of women . A mission that requires players to use torture equipment in a hostage interrogation polarised reviewers , who noted its political commentary but felt that the torture sequence was in poor taste . The mission also received criticism from politicians and anti-torture charity groups . The game became subject to widespread online debate over its portrayal of women , particularly in the wake of backlash against GameSpot journalist Carolyn Petit after she claimed the game was misogynistic in her review . After Petit 's review webpage received more than 20,000 largely negative comments , many journalists defended her right to an opinion and lamented the gaming community 's hostility towards criticism . Television personality Karen Gravano and actress Lindsay Lohan both filed lawsuits against Rockstar in allegation that characters in the game were based on their likenesses . Target 's Australian division pulled the game from their 300 stores following a Change.org petition that claimed the game " encourages players to commit sexual violence and kill women " , despite the petition being criticised as misleading and portrayals of sexual violence in games already being illegal in Australia .

                CONTEXT=The '' All Eyes on Sharon Tate '' documentary was used to publicize the film . Its 14 minutes consisted of a number of scenes depicting Tate filming '' Eye of the Devil '' , dancing in nightclubs , and sightseeing around London , and also contained a brief interview with her . Asked about her acting ambitions , she replied , " I do n't fool myself . I ca n't see myself doing Shakespeare . " She spoke of her hopes of finding a niche in comedy , and in other interviews she expressed her desire to become " a light comedienne in the Carole Lombard style " . She discussed the type of contemporary actress she wanted to emulate and explained that there were two in particular that she was influenced by : Faye Dunaway and Catherine Deneuve . Of the latter , she said , " I 'd like to be an American Catherine Deneuve . She plays beautiful , sensitive , deep parts with a little bit of intelligence behind them . " Later in the year , '' Valley of the Dolls '' opened to almost uniformly negative reviews . Bosley Crowther wrote in '' The New York Times '' , " all a fairly respectful admirer of movies can do is laugh at it and turn away " . '' Newsweek '' said that the film " has no more sense of its own ludicrousness than a village idiot stumbling in manure " , but a later article read : " Astoundingly photogenic , infinitely curvaceous , Sharon Tate is one of the most smashing young things to hit Hollywood in a long time . " The three lead actresses were castigated in numerous publications , including '' The Saturday Review '' , which wrote , " Ten years ago ... Parkins , Duke , and Tate would more likely have been playing the hat check girls than movie-queens ; they are totally lacking in style , authority , or charm . " '' The Hollywood Reporter '' provided some positive comments , such as , " Sharon Tate emerges as the film 's most sympathetic character ... William H. Daniels ' photographic caress of her faultless face and enormous absorbent eyes is stunning . " Roger Ebert of the '' Chicago Sun-Times '' praised Tate as " a wonder to behold " , but after describing the dialogue in one scene as " the most offensive and appalling vulgarity ever thrown up by any civilization " , concluded that , " I will be unable to take her any more seriously as a sex symbol than Raquel Welch . " In late 1967 , Tate and Polanski returned to London and were frequent subjects of newspaper and magazine articles . Tate was depicted as being untraditional and modern , and was quoted as saying couples should live together before marrying . They were married in Chelsea , London , on January 20 , 1968 , with considerable publicity . Polanski was dressed in what the press described as " Edwardian finery " , while Tate was attired in a white minidress . The couple moved into Polanski 's mews house off Eaton Square in Belgravia , London . Photographer Peter Evans later described them as " the imperfect couple . They were the Douglas Fairbanks/Mary Pickford of our time ... Cool , nomadic , talented , and nicely shocking . " While Tate reportedly wanted a traditional marriage , Polanski remained somewhat promiscuous and described Tate 's attitude to his infidelity as " Sharon 's big hang-up " . He reminded Tate that she had promised that she would not try to change him . Tate accepted Polanski 's conditions , though she confided to friends that she hoped he would change . Peter Evans quoted Tate as saying , " We have a good arrangement . Roman lies to me and I pretend to believe him . " Polanski urged Tate to end her association with Martin Ransohoff , and Tate began to place less importance on her career until Polanski told her he wanted to be married to " a hippie , not a housewife . " The couple returned to Los Angeles and quickly became part of a social group that included some of the most successful young people in the film industry , including Warren Beatty , Jacqueline Bisset , Leslie Caron , Joan Collins , Mia Farrow , Jane Fonda , Peter Fonda , Laurence Harvey , Steve McQueen , Joanna Pettet and Peter Sellers ; older film stars like Yul Brynner , Kirk Douglas , Henry Fonda and Danny Kaye ; musicians such as Jim Morrison and The Mamas & the Papas ; and record producer Terry Melcher and his girlfriend , actress Candice Bergen . Jay Sebring remained one of the couple 's more frequent companions . Polanski 's circle of friends included people he had known since his youth in Poland such as Wojciech Frykowski and Frykowski 's girlfriend , coffee heiress Abigail Folger . Tate and Polanski moved into the Chateau Marmont Hotel in Los Angeles for a few months until they arranged to lease Patty Duke 's home on Summit Ridge Drive in Beverly Hills during the latter part of 1968 . The Polanski house was often full of strangers , and Tate regarded the casual atmosphere as part of the " free spirit " of the times , saying that she did not mind who came into her home as her motto was " live and let live . " Her close friend Leslie Caron later commented that the Polanskis were too trusting — " to the point of recklessness " — and that she had been alarmed by it

" Alex Pappademas , writing for '' Spin '' , compared the song to the music of Weezer . Katy Kroll of '' Billboard '' recognized it among her top 10 singles of 2000 , calling it " a good old-fashioned depressing song with mainstream flair . " Geoff Boucher , writing for the '' Los Angeles Times '' , called it " a poignant essay on a teen mulling over suicide " ; conversely , Steve Appleford of the '' Los Angeles Times '' dubbed it a " moving if unremarkable examination . " Scott Mervis of the '' Pittsburgh Post-Gazette '' called it a " rare departure from the usual Blink fare . " Writers for '' The A.V. Club '' listed it among other suicide-related songs in 2009 , describing it as " surprisingly affecting , especially when the band reaches the bombastic chorus , and when the song describes suicide 's crushing aftermath . " In a retrospective review , Chris Payne of '' Billboard '' wrote , " Stylistically , it 's also a Blink breakthrough : rather than putting their heads down and plowing through at breakneck speed , the band dials back the verses and interludes to let them breathe a bit . The resulting chorus achieves an arena-worthy feel not achieved anywhere else on '' Enema of the State '' . " The song caused a controversy in 2000 when it was set to replay indefinitely on a nearby stereo as 17-year-old Greg Barnes , a teenager who attended Columbine High School and had lost one of his best friends in the massacre the previous year , hanged himself in the garage of his family 's home . Both Hoppus and DeLonge were sympathetic but stressed the song 's meaning during an MTV News interview in 2001 : Hoppus also told interviewers that he received fan mail following the song 's release from fans that had contemplated suicide , but decided not to go through with it after hearing the song . '' Rolling Stone '' compared the controversy to that of Ozzy Osbourne 's " Suicide Solution " , which similarly was playing as a teen committed suicide

That there was a space opening up , maybe a billion little loudspeakers walking around the planet , but nobody was really thinking of this as a space for creative music . So I set out to make these tiny little fragments and then , of course , in the poetic sense , the idea of these little sound carrying objects traversing the planet , I started to think of these as a connection , as a sort of postcard into somebody 's life , into their space . " Richter 's 2010 album '' Infra '' takes as its central theme the 2005 terrorist bombings in London , and is an extension of his 25-minute score for a ballet of the same name choreographed by Wayne McGregor and staged at the Royal Opera House . '' Infra '' comprises music written for piano , electronics and string quintet , plus the full performance score and material that subsequently developed from the construction of the album . '' Pitchfork '' described the album as " achingly gorgeous " and '' The Independent '' newspaper characterised it as " a journey in 13 episodes , emerging from a blur of static and finding its way in a repeated phrase that grows in loveliness . " Richter 's recomposed version of Vivaldi 's '' The Four Seasons '' , '' Recomposed by Max Richter : Vivaldi – The Four Seasons '' , was premiered in the UK at the Barbican Centre on 31 October 2012 , performed by the Britten Sinfonia , conducted by André de Ridder and with violinist Daniel Hope . Although Richter said that he had discarded 75 % of Vivaldi 's original material , the parts he does use are phased and looped , emphasising his grounding in postmodern and minimalist music . The album topped the iTunes classical chart in the UK , Germany and the US . The US launch concert in New York at Le Poisson Rouge was recorded by NPR and streamed

It featured the singles " Crazy Little Thing Called Love " and " Another One Bites the Dust " , both of which reached number one in the US . After attending a Queen concert in Los Angeles , Michael Jackson suggested to Mercury backstage that " Another One Bites the Dust " be released as a single , and in October 1980 it spent three weeks at number one . The album topped the '' Billboard '' 200 for five weeks , and sold over four million copies in the US . It was also the first appearance of a synthesiser on a Queen album . Heretofore , their albums featured a distinctive " No Synthesisers ! " sleeve note . The note is widely assumed to reflect an anti-synth , pro- " hard " - rock stance by the band , but was later revealed by producer Roy Thomas Baker to be an attempt to clarify that those albums ' multi-layered solos were created with guitars , not synths , as record company executives kept assuming at the time . In September 1980 , Queen performed three sold-out shows at Madison Square Garden . In 1980 , Queen also released the soundtrack they had recorded for '' Flash Gordon '' . At the 1981 American Music Awards in January , " Another One Bites the Dust " won the award for Favorite Pop/Rock Single , and Queen were nominated for Favorite Pop/Rock Band , Duo , or Group

It was also shortlisted for the 2018 Kobo Emerging Writer Prize , longlisted for the 2019 International Dublin Literary Award , and won the QWF 's 2017 Concordia University First Book Prize . Uncertain Weights and Measures began as a Masters thesis in the Creative Writing Program at Concordia University . Set in post-revolutionary Moscow , the novel traces the life of a young research scientist working at a brain institute that housed Lenin 's brain , and that of the man she loves , Sasha , whose artistic ambitions run afoul of the state - sanctioned aesthetics . A writer for The Walrus suggests the book could " very well be read as a cautionary allegory of our ' brave and visionary time . ' " James Gifford , writing for Canadian Literature , writes that the " sustained tension between plot and thought is the novel 's greatest success . The reader is pressed to ask challenging questions of history , science , and private life without ever shifting out of the gripping narrative . Uncertain Weights and Measures is clearly a novel of ideas , but it never reads like a treatise or thought experiment , though in a sense it is . Parr was nominated for the Governor General 's Award , and her first book declares the opening of an exciting career . "

Railroad contractor Philip Duffy hired 57 Irish immigrants to lay this line through the area 's densely wooded hills and ravines . The workers came to Philadelphia from the Ulster counties of Donegal , Tyrone and Londonderry to work in Pennsylvania 's nascent railroad industry . While their fates are unclear , a theory based on a record from a railroad archive suggests all 57 died of cholera during the second cholera pandemic . The remains of seven have been discovered at the site , and forensic evidence suggests that some may have been murdered , perhaps due to fear of contagion as the pandemic spanned several continents over many years . While this has become the most popular theory , a coroner who studied the bones believes the alleged bullet holes and injuries were actually due to natural decomposition and post-mortem damage .

Located in Washington , D.C. , this professional improvisational theater offered participatory workshops to children , youth , teachers , parents , and community members . Living Stage ’s main philosophy was based in the belief that every one is born an artist and the act of creation is the ultimate act of self - affirmation . The company 's mission was to transform individuals and communities through creative empowerment . The projects that the Living Stage put on typically dealt with controversial and sensitive topics like race , economic inequality , the dangers of an overzealous American foreign policy , the atom bomb , violence , and freedom . The " Baltimore Incident " of 1971 is an excellent example of how controversial these productions could be . No matter how mixed opinions were , the Living Stage always elicited a reaction with their improvisational performances . During the 1980s the Living Stage began to reach out extensively to local initiatives like The District 's Alcohol and Drug Abuse Services Administration and created their own Community Services Project in order to continue to bring theater and creativity to underserved sections of society . The Living Stage championed New Left ideals like equality and social justice throughout the Reagan years , despite some criticisms about their message being " anachronistic " . The Living Stage dissolved after 36 years and was a venture of Arena Stage .

                CONTEXT=The '' ' Dumbarton Rail Bridge ' '' ( then known as the '' ' Dumbarton Point Bridge ' '' or , simply , '' ' Dumbarton Bridge ' '' ; one of the major structures of the '' ' Dumbarton Cut-off ' '' rail line ) was championed by E. H. Harriman . Prior to the completion of the Dumbarton Cut-off , transcontinental rail freight was offloaded at Oakland and ferried to San Francisco . Preliminary work started in 1904 with the condemnation of land at Dumbarton Point , and the incorporation of the Central California Railway Company , created by several Southern Pacific officers for the sole purpose of building a rail line from Newark to San Mateo . There was some opposition to the bridge from local business groups , and the United States Army Corps of Engineers held a public hearing in August 1906 inviting public feedback on the plans for the bridge . Henry Rengstorff argued the bridge would impede water traffic , which was needed as an alternate route in case of a railroad strike or natural disaster , such as the recent earthquake

It featured the singles " Crazy Little Thing Called Love " and " Another One Bites the Dust " , both of which reached number one in the US . After attending a Queen concert in Los Angeles , Michael Jackson suggested to Mercury backstage that " Another One Bites the Dust " be released as a single , and in October 1980 it spent three weeks at number one . The album topped the '' Billboard '' 200 for five weeks , and sold over four million copies in the US . It was also the first appearance of a synthesiser on a Queen album . Heretofore , their albums featured a distinctive " No Synthesisers ! " sleeve note . The note is widely assumed to reflect an anti-synth , pro- " hard " - rock stance by the band , but was later revealed by producer Roy Thomas Baker to be an attempt to clarify that those albums ' multi-layered solos were created with guitars , not synths , as record company executives kept assuming at the time . In September 1980 , Queen performed three sold-out shows at Madison Square Garden . In 1980 , Queen also released the soundtrack they had recorded for '' Flash Gordon '' . At the 1981 American Music Awards in January , " Another One Bites the Dust " won the award for Favorite Pop/Rock Single , and Queen were nominated for Favorite Pop/Rock Band , Duo , or Group

                CONTEXT=Betrayal is the secondary theme of '' The Wild Bunch '' . The characters suffer from their knowledge of having betrayed a friend and left him to his fate , thus violating their own honor code when it suits them ( " $ 10,000 cuts an awful lot of family ties " ) . However , Bishop says , " When you side with a man , you stay with him , and if you ca n't do that you 're like some animal . " Such oppositional ideas lead to the film 's violent conclusion , as the remaining men find their abandonment of Angel intolerable . Bishop remembers his betrayals , most notably when he deserts Deke Thornton ( in flashback ) when the law catches up to them and when he abandons Crazy Lee at the railroad office after the robbery ( ostensibly to guard the hostages ) . Critic David Weddle writes that , " like that of Conrad 's '' Lord Jim '' , Pike Bishop 's heroism is propelled by overwhelming guilt and a despairing death wish . " Vincent Canby began his review by calling the film " very beautiful and the first truly interesting American-made Western in years . It 's also so full of violence — of an intensity that can hardly be supported by the story — that it 's going to prompt a lot of people who do not know the real effect of movie violence ( as I do not ) to write automatic condemnations of it . " He observed , " Although the movie 's conventional and poetic action sequences are extraordinarily good and its landscapes beautifully photographed ... it is most interesting in its almost jolly account of chaos , corruption , and defeat " . About the actors , he commented particularly on William Holden : " After years of giving bored performances in boring movies , Holden comes back gallantly in '' The Wild Bunch '' . He looks older and tired , but he has style , both as a man and as a movie character who persists in doing what he 's always done , not because he really wants the money but because there 's simply nothing else to do . " '' TIME '' also liked Holden 's performance , describing it as his best since '' Stalag 17 '' ( a 1953 film that earned Holden an Oscar ) , noting Robert Ryan gave " the screen performance of his career " , and concluding that " '' The Wild Bunch '' contains faults and mistakes " ( such as flashbacks " introduced with surprising clumsiness " ) , but " its accomplishments are more than sufficient to confirm that Peckinpah , along with Stanley Kubrick and Arthur Penn , belongs with the best of the newer generation of American filmmakers . " In a 2002 retrospective Roger Ebert , who " saw the original version at the world premiere in 1969 , during the golden age of the junket , when Warner Bros. screened five of its new films in the Bahamas for 450 critics and reporters " , said that back then he had publicly declared the film a masterpiece during the junket 's press conference , prompted by comments from " a reporter from the '' Reader 's Digest '' who got up to ask ' Why was this film ever made ? ' " He compared the film to '' Pulp Fiction '' : " praised and condemned with equal vehemence . " " What '' Citizen Kane '' was to movie lovers in 1941 , '' The Wild Bunch '' was to cineastes in 1969 , " wrote film critic Michael Sragow , who added that Peckinpah had " produced an American movie that equals or surpasses the best of Kurosawa : the Gotterdammerung of Westerns "

                CONTEXT=Donen solidified his solo career and scored another hit with the musical '' Seven Brides for Seven Brothers '' ( 1954 ) . Based on a short story by Stephen Vincent Benét , the film 's music is by Saul Chaplin and Gene de Paul , with lyrics by Johnny Mercer and choreography by Michael Kidd . Jane Powell plays Milly , an 1850s frontierswoman who marries Adam ( Howard Keel ) only hours after meeting him . When she returns with Adam to his log cabin in the Oregon backwoods , Milly discovers that her husband 's six brothers are uncivilized and oafish . She makes it her mission to domesticate them and , upon Milly 's sarcastic suggestion , the brothers kidnap six women from a neighboring town to marry them . The film was shot in the new CinemaScope format and is remembered for its dance sequences , particularly the " barn raising scene " in which architecture and construction become acrobatic ballet steps . '' Seven Brides for Seven Brothers '' was one of the highest-grossing films of 1954 and appeared on many critics ' 10 Best Films lists . It was nominated for five Academy Awards , including Best Picture and Best Music ( Scoring of a Musical Picture ) , which it won . Its success was a surprise to MGM , which invested more money in two other musicals : '' Rose Marie '' and '' Brigadoon '' , starring Kelly . '' Seven Brides for Seven Brothers '' was more profitable than either of the other films , as well as '' On the Town '' and '' Singin ' in the Rain '' , and its success was a major turning point for Donen 's career . The film was later criticized by novelist Francine Prose , who described it as anti-woman , calling it " one of the most repulsive movies about men and women that has ever been made " and a musical about rape

                CONTEXT=The 1998 memorial for the 1973 UpStairs Lounge arson attack and fire proved to be a turning point for the modern LGBTQ modern rights movement in New Orleans when mourners refused to avoid TV cameras and media awaiting outside the service . Instead of using the side exit and leaving through an alley the 300-strong crowd sang " United We Stand " , a theme song of the gay bar , as they left the memorial service through the front doors . Previous to this the LGBTQ community was closeted and underground . The fire was called the " first gay tragedy of the modern rights movement " and " the last major national news event in the gay community to go almost completely unreported by the national media . " The Metropolitan Community Church has a long history in the city of New Orleans , dating back to the 1970s . A small congregation , led by Reverend William " Bill " Larson , formed in 1971 and first started holding Sunday afternoon services at St. George 's Episcopal Church run by Father Bill P. Richardson , a minister who had employed gays as assistant ministers and had just recently returned from a summer Union Theological Seminary seminar entitled " Homosexuality , Women 's Liberation , and Communal Living . " The Gay Liberation Front had recently collapsed and Richardson was determined to assist the LGBTQ community to " accept themselves . " St. George 's even opened an alternative bookstore which stocked feminist and gay liberation titles . MCC New Orleans met at St. George 's for the first six months of its existence . They then met at the Up Stairs Lounge before moving to Larson 's apartment in 1973 until June 24 , 1973 , when the UpStairs Lounge arson attack took the lives of Larson and other members of the congregation . It was one of two dozen attacks on MCC churches over the years , but it was the deadliest eventually taking thirty-two lives including both the pastor and associate pastor , the casualties included one third of the local MCC chapter . The New Orleans church was one of 36 MCC 's in the country , MCC was emerging and remains one of the largest membership LGBT organizations in the world . According to '' Out For Good '' authors Dudley Clendinen and Adam Nagourney , it was " the first gay tragedy of the modern gay rights movement , " and possibly " the last major national news event in the gay community to go almost completely unreported by the national media . " The lounge was crowded with members of the congregation and revelers celebrating the final night of their Gay pride weekend . The fire had been set on the stairs to the upstairs bar between the street door and the " solid fire door " at the second-floor entrance . The " canvas awning over the street door was untouched . " From the night of the fire the New Orleans Police Department , the State Fire Marshall 's Office and the Fire Prevention Bureau treated the blaze as an arson and repeatedly spoke of it in that light . The police department 's chief of detectives , Major Henry Morris , said there was hints of firebombing , but no evidence to prove it . No lighter or trace of gasoline was found . It was the deadliest fire in the city for nearly two hundred years and No one was ever convicted of the crimes

                CONTEXT=Under the popular leadership of Andrew Jackson , the Democrats had established a stable party . The 1835 Democratic National Convention chose a ticket of Van Buren , Jackson 's handpicked successor , and Congressman Richard Mentor Johnson . By contrast , the Whigs had only recently emerged and were primarily united by opposition to Jackson . Not yet sufficiently organized to agree on a single candidate , Whigs hoped to compel a contingent election in the House of Representatives by denying the Democrats an electoral majority , similarly to the election of 1824 . Thus , the Whigs ran two main tickets . Most Northern and border state Whigs supported the ticket led by former Senator William Henry Harrison of Ohio , while most Southern Whigs supported the ticket led by Senator Hugh Lawson White of Tennessee . Two other Whigs , Daniel Webster and Willie Person Mangum , carried Massachusetts and South Carolina respectively on single-state tickets . The Whig strategy failed , as Van Buren won both an electoral majority and a popular majority , though in South Carolina no popular vote was held and the state legislature chose Whig electors . The Whig strategy nearly succeeded in forcing the contingent election , as in 1835 , a severe state-level Democratic Party split in Pennsylvania had propelled the Whig-aligned Anti-Masonic Party to statewide power . Party alignments by state in the House of Representatives suggest that a contingent election would have had an uncertain outcome , with Van Buren favored but no candidate enjoying a clear path to victory . However , Van Buren overcame the split , narrowly carrying Pennsylvania and winning the Presidency

                CONTEXT=Living Stage Theatre Company was a theatre for social change founded in 1966 by Robert A. Alexander ( 1929 – 2008 ) . He served as the artistic director until 1995 . Located in Washington , D.C. , this professional improvisational theater offered participatory workshops to children , youth , teachers , parents , and community members . Living Stage ’s main philosophy was based in the belief that every one is born an artist and the act of creation is the ultimate act of self - affirmation . The company 's mission was to transform individuals and communities through creative empowerment . The projects that the Living Stage put on typically dealt with controversial and sensitive topics like race , economic inequality , the dangers of an overzealous American foreign policy , the atom bomb , violence , and freedom . The " Baltimore Incident " of 1971 is an excellent example of how controversial these productions could be . No matter how mixed opinions were , the Living Stage always elicited a reaction with their improvisational performances . During the 1980s the Living Stage began to reach out extensively to local initiatives like The District 's Alcohol and Drug Abuse Services Administration and created their own Community Services Project in order to continue to bring theater and creativity to underserved sections of society . The Living Stage championed New Left ideals like equality and social justice throughout the Reagan years , despite some criticisms about their message being " anachronistic " . The Living Stage dissolved after 36 years and was a venture of Arena Stage .

By February 23 , 2018 , the track " This Is Me " was nominated for Best Original Song at the 2018 Academy Awards . According to Sky News on March 25 , 2018 , " music critics have put the album 's success down to the feel-good , uplifting pop tunes which are also old school at the same time . " Sheila O'Malley of RogerEbert.com called the 11 songs " memorable , " praising the vocal performances of the leads . The women 's magazine '' Bustle '' gave it a positive review , particularly certain vocal performances . '' Stereogum '' described the soundtrack music as eclectic in its influences , giving it a negative reception for " serving up earnest buoyancy in many high-fructose flavors . " Also noting the eclectic mix of musical genres , '' The Ringer '' writes that " the bombastic tunes mix EDM gleams with stadium-rock grunts , chest-pounding ballads with peppy empowerment anthems , a thoroughly modern and disconcertingly eager post-genre assault designed to barnstorm as many Spotify playlists as possible . It 's a gilded cheese ball , pushing exhilaration to the point of exhaustion . " '' The Guardian '' wrote that the album brought " a whole lot of self-empowerment , enlivened with some deracinated R&B beats , and given the necessary gravitas by some power ballads of the sort that make one imagine the singer filmed from below with a wind machine blowing in their face . " Keala Settle performed " This Is Me " live on '' The Graham Norton Show '' on February 9 , 2018 . Later she performed on '' The Ellen DeGeneres Show '' on February 21 , 2018 .

It featured the singles " Crazy Little Thing Called Love " and " Another One Bites the Dust " , both of which reached number one in the US . After attending a Queen concert in Los Angeles , Michael Jackson suggested to Mercury backstage that " Another One Bites the Dust " be released as a single , and in October 1980 it spent three weeks at number one . The album topped the '' Billboard '' 200 for five weeks , and sold over four million copies in the US . It was also the first appearance of a synthesiser on a Queen album . Heretofore , their albums featured a distinctive " No Synthesisers ! " sleeve note . The note is widely assumed to reflect an anti-synth , pro- " hard " - rock stance by the band , but was later revealed by producer Roy Thomas Baker to be an attempt to clarify that those albums ' multi-layered solos were created with guitars , not synths , as record company executives kept assuming at the time . In September 1980 , Queen performed three sold-out shows at Madison Square Garden . In 1980 , Queen also released the soundtrack they had recorded for '' Flash Gordon '' . At the 1981 American Music Awards in January , " Another One Bites the Dust " won the award for Favorite Pop/Rock Single , and Queen were nominated for Favorite Pop/Rock Band , Duo , or Group

                CONTEXT=Music critics favorably reviewed " Never Catch Me " . Named Best New Track by '' Pitchfork Media '' , editor Jayson Greene praised Lamar 's performance , writing " his hyper-vaulting flow and embedded rhyme patterns within rhyme patterns " . For its year-end list of " The 100 Best Tracks of 2014 " , '' Pitchfork '' ranked the song at number 23 . Also commenting on Lamar , '' Billboard '' 's Chris Payne wrote , " There are n't many A-list rappers who could handle a beat like this , but Kendrick is clearly one of them . " '' Rolling Stone '' editor Jon Dolan gave the song three-and-a-half out of five stars , commenting " Over offhandedly lovely , warp-speed psychedelic soul-jazz , Lamar unleashes a word-mad waterfall with a worried emotional core ( " analyze my demise I say I 'm super-anxious " , he raps ) . " '' Consequence of Sound '' editor Nina Corcoran wrote : " when combined with one of Lamar ’s hottest verses to date ( before '' To Pimp a Butterfly '' ) , the song explodes . But it does n’t stop there . FlyLo shows off his talent by shifting gears post-Kendrick verse the only way you can : insane keys , double-time bass drum , and unrelenting hand claps . Eventually , it ’s all swallowed up in massive swelling synth and choral hums , fading to a beautiful , passionate outro . " Directed by Hiro Murai , the video begins at a funeral ( including attendees Flying Lotus and Thundercat in cameo roles ) . Seemingly a sad video , it turns instantly joyful when the two late children - a boy and a girl - bound out of their caskets at the front of the church and dance gleefully down the aisle . The mourners ca n't see the children as they dance right out of the church and out onto a blacktop , but a group of other kids chases after them as they hop in a hearse and drive away . The clip was featured by several publications on their year-end list of best videos , including '' Pitchfork '' , '' Spin '' , and Stereogumwith the latter listing it at number one . The video received two nominations at the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards : Best Choreography and Best Cinematography , ultimately winning the latter

                CONTEXT=Some of the most unfavorable reviews came from major American newspapers . A. O. Scott of '' The New York Times '' describes '' 300 '' as " about as violent as '' Apocalypto '' and twice as stupid , " while criticizing its color scheme and suggesting that its plot includes racist undertones ; Scott also poked fun at the buffed bodies of the actors portraying the Spartans , declaring that the Persian characters are " pioneers in the art of face-piercing " , but that the Spartans had access to " superior health clubs and electrolysis facilities " . Kenneth Turan writes in the '' Los Angeles Times '' that " unless you love violence as much as a Spartan , Quentin Tarantino or a video-game-playing teenage boy , you will not be endlessly fascinated . " Roger Ebert , in his review , gave the film a two-star rating , writing , " '' 300 '' has one-dimensional caricatures who talk like professional wrestlers plugging their next feud . " Some critics employed at Greek newspapers have been particularly critical , such as film critic Robby Eksiel , who said that moviegoers would be dazzled by the " digital action " but irritated by the " pompous interpretations and one-dimensional characters .

" Writing in the '' Chicago Sun Times '' , Richard Roeper acclaims '' 300 '' as " the '' Citizen Kane '' of cinematic graphic novels . " '' Empire '' gave the film 3 out of 5 having a verdict of " Visually stunning , thoroughly belligerent and as shallow as a pygmy 's paddling pool , this is a whole heap of style tinged with just a smidgen of substance . " '' 300 '' was also warmly received by websites focusing on comics and video games . Comic Book Resources ' Mark Cronan found the film compelling , leaving him " with a feeling of power , from having been witness to something grand . " IGN 's Todd Gilchrist acclaimed Zack Snyder as a cinematic visionary and " a possible redeemer of modern moviemaking . " At the MTV Movie Awards 2007 , '' 300 '' was nominated for Best Movie , Best Performance for Gerard Butler , Best Breakthrough Performance for Lena Headey , Best Villain for Rodrigo Santoro , and Best Fight for Leonidas battling " the Über Immortal " , but only won the award for Best Fight .

It was screened at the 2001 Toronto International Film Festival and the 2001 Fort Lauderdale International Film Festival . In an unspecified Eastern European country , soldiers round up the inhabitants of a village . Ten year old Zioig ( Javor Loznica ) is separated from his mother Ankica ( Gina McKee ) . While being transported in a truck , Ziog 's father ( Mikulás Kren ) tells his son that he is a man now and that grown men do n't cry . The soldiers kill the men but Zioig manages to escape . Meanwhile in the capital city , a former Interior Ministry official and Communist party member named Ludovic ( Sam Neill ) works at a zoo . He receives a letter from his estranged daughter Anna in Paris who wants to reconcile with her father . With the city under siege , Ludovic volunteers to help the Indian veterinary ( Om Puri ) to look after the animals until they can safely evacuate them . Due to scarce supplies , they are forced to put the animals on rations . Elsewhere , the orphaned Zioig is picked up by a truck carrying United Nations peacekeepers . During the journey , he jumps out of the truck while the peacekeepers are asleep and steals two boxes of supplies . Back in the capital city , Ludovic encounters the militia leader Dragov ( Ulrich Thomsen ) at a checkpoint . Despite lacking identity papers , Dragov lets him through because they are of the same race . Ludovic moves into the zoo and helps the veterinary to look after the animals . Ludovic develops an attachment to a female gibbon named " Luisa . " While visiting the wolves ' pen , Ludovic encounters the orphaned Zioig and tells the boy to leave . Amidst the fighting , Ludovic befriends the Vet while drinking . The Vet tells Ludovic that good men do the right thing in bad times . The following morning , Dragov and his militia visit the zoo and arrests the Vet because he is of a different race . When Ludovic protests , Dragov replies that they will let him go if he is innocent . Ludovic is forced to look after the animals alone .

While at the zoo ’s butchery , Ankica recounts her experiences in a prison camp where she was raped by a guard who used to be her neighbor . Ankica also begs Ludovic to be kind to her son in order to help him . While Ludovic spends time with Zioig , Ankica reads through Ludovic 's diaries . When Dragov and his militia return to seize the farm animals for food , Ludovic hides Ankica inside a barn .

                CONTEXT=The show received a negative reception from most media publications . Associated Press television critic Frazier Moore lamented that Crystal " seemed incredibly listless " . He also questioned the purpose of the " Year of the Woman " theme writing , " The Oscar show itself seemed at odds with its own feminist theme . " Robert Bianco from the '' Pittsburgh Post-Gazette '' derided Allen 's musical production numbers , comparing them to the disastrous opening number at the 61st ceremony held in 1989 . Columnist Matt Roush of '' USA Today '' complained , " Crystal , in a by-now-familiar performance , has , in four years , taken a plum assignment and , by repetition , reduced it to shtick . " He also wrote that , " The song medley is getting old hat , " and the " smug references to his flop '' Mr. Saturday Night '' were out of an improv amateur night . " The telecast also received unfavorable reaction from various public feminist figures . In an interview with '' Los Angeles Daily News '' author and activist Betty Friedan condemned the " Year of the Woman " theme commenting , " It had no basis in reality . On behalf of women directors , cinematographer , and producers , I resent the travesty of calling that a tribute . " Likewise , President of the National Organization for Women 's Los Angeles chapter Tammy Bruce chastised ceremony 's feminist tribute as " one of the most hypocritical , patronizing things I saw in my whole life . " In response , Gil Cates responded towards the criticism of the theme stating , " The theme developed and raised consciousness in a way that I think is positive , not only for the individual in general but for individual women specifically . " He also quoted an ancient Chinese proverb later made famous by former U.S. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt saying , " It is better to light one candle than to curse the darkness " Despite the adverse reception , the ABC broadcast drew in an average of 45.7 million people over its length , which was a 3 % increase from the previous year 's ceremony . The show also drew higher Nielsen ratings compared to the previous ceremony with 31.2 % of households watching over a 51 share . It also drew a higher 18 – 49 demo rating with a 20.1 rating among viewers in that demographic

                CONTEXT=In the aftermath of the battle over the national bank , Jackson 's political opponents coalesced into the Whig Party . By taking a name rooted in American and British history , the Whigs implicitly criticized Jackson as a tyrannical executive . Although National Republicans like Clay and Webster formed the core of the Whig Party , Anti-Masonic leaders like William H. Seward and states ' rights Democrats like John Tyler also joined the new party . The Whig Party proved more durable than the National Republican Party and , along with the Democrats , the Whigs became one of the two major parties of the Second Party System , which would extend into the 1850s . By 1834 , Webster supporters such as Caleb Cushing , Rufus Choate , Abbott Lawrence , and Edward Everett had begun preparing for his candidacy in the 1836 presidential election . With Clay showing no indication of making another run , Webster hoped to become the main Whig candidate in the 1836 election , but General William Henry Harrison and Senator Hugh Lawson White retained strong support in the West and the South , respectively . Rather than uniting behind one presidential candidate , Whig leaders settled on a strategy of running multiple candidates in order to force a contingent election in the House of Representatives . Webster was nominated for president by the Massachusetts legislature , but Harrison won the backing of most Whigs outside of the South . Although Webster had a far greater reputation as a national figure than Harrison , many Whigs hoped that Harrison 's military record would allow him to replicate Jackson 's 1832 victory . Webster 's chances also suffered from his lingering association with the Federalist Party , his close relationship with elite politicians and businessmen , and his lack of appeal among the broad populace ; Remini writes that the American public " admired and revered him but did not love or trust him . " With little support outside of his home state , Webster attempted to withdraw his presidential candidacy , but , to his eventual regret , Massachusetts Whig leaders convinced him to stay in the race . Meanwhile , the 1835 Democratic National Convention nominated Van Buren , Jackson 's preferred successor , for president . In the 1836 election , Van Buren won a majority of the popular and electoral vote , Harrison finished a distant second , and White carried two Southern states . Webster won only the electoral votes of Massachusetts . Adding to his displeasure , Webster lost a major Supreme Court decision , '' Charles River Bridge v. Warren Bridge '' , shortly after the election

                CONTEXT=Music critics favorably reviewed " Never Catch Me " . Named Best New Track by '' Pitchfork Media '' , editor Jayson Greene praised Lamar 's performance , writing " his hyper-vaulting flow and embedded rhyme patterns within rhyme patterns " . For its year-end list of " The 100 Best Tracks of 2014 " , '' Pitchfork '' ranked the song at number 23 . Also commenting on Lamar , '' Billboard '' 's Chris Payne wrote , " There are n't many A-list rappers who could handle a beat like this , but Kendrick is clearly one of them . " '' Rolling Stone '' editor Jon Dolan gave the song three-and-a-half out of five stars , commenting " Over offhandedly lovely , warp-speed psychedelic soul-jazz , Lamar unleashes a word-mad waterfall with a worried emotional core ( " analyze my demise I say I 'm super-anxious " , he raps ) . " '' Consequence of Sound '' editor Nina Corcoran wrote : " when combined with one of Lamar ’s hottest verses to date ( before '' To Pimp a Butterfly '' ) , the song explodes . But it does n’t stop there . FlyLo shows off his talent by shifting gears post-Kendrick verse the only way you can : insane keys , double-time bass drum , and unrelenting hand claps . Eventually , it ’s all swallowed up in massive swelling synth and choral hums , fading to a beautiful , passionate outro . " Directed by Hiro Murai , the video begins at a funeral ( including attendees Flying Lotus and Thundercat in cameo roles ) . Seemingly a sad video , it turns instantly joyful when the two late children - a boy and a girl - bound out of their caskets at the front of the church and dance gleefully down the aisle . The mourners ca n't see the children as they dance right out of the church and out onto a blacktop , but a group of other kids chases after them as they hop in a hearse and drive away .

It featured the singles " Crazy Little Thing Called Love " and " Another One Bites the Dust " , both of which reached number one in the US . After attending a Queen concert in Los Angeles , Michael Jackson suggested to Mercury backstage that " Another One Bites the Dust " be released as a single , and in October 1980 it spent three weeks at number one . The album topped the '' Billboard '' 200 for five weeks , and sold over four million copies in the US . It was also the first appearance of a synthesiser on a Queen album . Heretofore , their albums featured a distinctive " No Synthesisers ! " sleeve note . The note is widely assumed to reflect an anti-synth , pro- " hard " - rock stance by the band , but was later revealed by producer Roy Thomas Baker to be an attempt to clarify that those albums ' multi-layered solos were created with guitars , not synths , as record company executives kept assuming at the time . In September 1980 , Queen performed three sold-out shows at Madison Square Garden . In 1980 , Queen also released the soundtrack they had recorded for '' Flash Gordon '' . At the 1981 American Music Awards in January , " Another One Bites the Dust " won the award for Favorite Pop/Rock Single , and Queen were nominated for Favorite Pop/Rock Band , Duo , or Group

                GOLD_MENTION=1835 Democratic National Convention
                CONTEXT=In the aftermath of the battle over the national bank , Jackson 's political opponents coalesced into the Whig Party . By taking a name rooted in American and British history , the Whigs implicitly criticized Jackson as a tyrannical executive . Although National Republicans like Clay and Webster formed the core of the Whig Party , Anti-Masonic leaders like William H. Seward and states ' rights Democrats like John Tyler also joined the new party . The Whig Party proved more durable than the National Republican Party and , along with the Democrats , the Whigs became one of the two major parties of the Second Party System , which would extend into the 1850s . By 1834 , Webster supporters such as Caleb Cushing , Rufus Choate , Abbott Lawrence , and Edward Everett had begun preparing for his candidacy in the 1836 presidential election . With Clay showing no indication of making another run , Webster hoped to become the main Whig candidate in the 1836 election , but General William Henry Harrison and Senator Hugh Lawson White retained strong support in the West and the South , respectively . Rather than uniting behind one presidential candidate , Whig leaders settled on a strategy of running multiple candidates in order to force a contingent election in the House of Representatives . Webster was nominated for president by the Massachusetts legislature , but Harrison won the backing of most Whigs outside of the South . Although Webster had a far greater reputation as a national figure than Harrison , many Whigs hoped that Harrison 's military record would allow him to replicate Jackson 's 1832 victory . Webster 's chances also suffered from his lingering association with the Federalist Party , his close relationship with elite politicians and businessmen , and his lack of appeal among the broad populace ; Remini writes that the American public " admired and revered him but did not love or trust him . " With little support outside of his home state , Webster attempted to withdraw his presidential candidacy , but , to his eventual regret , Massachusetts Whig leaders convinced him to stay in the race . Meanwhile , the 1835 Democratic National Convention nominated Van Buren , Jackson 's preferred successor , for president . In the 1836 election , Van Buren won a majority of the popular and electoral vote , Harrison finished a distant second , and White carried two Southern states . Webster won only the electoral votes of Massachusetts . Adding to his displeasure , Webster lost a major Supreme Court decision , '' Charles River Bridge v. Warren Bridge '' , shortly after the election

                CONTEXT=Living Stage Theatre Company was a theatre for social change founded in 1966 by Robert A. Alexander ( 1929 – 2008 ) . He served as the artistic director until 1995 . Located in Washington , D.C. , this professional improvisational theater offered participatory workshops to children , youth , teachers , parents , and community members . Living Stage ’s main philosophy was based in the belief that every one is born an artist and the act of creation is the ultimate act of self - affirmation . The company 's mission was to transform individuals and communities through creative empowerment . The projects that the Living Stage put on typically dealt with controversial and sensitive topics like race , economic inequality , the dangers of an overzealous American foreign policy , the atom bomb , violence , and freedom . The " Baltimore Incident " of 1971 is an excellent example of how controversial these productions could be . No matter how mixed opinions were , the Living Stage always elicited a reaction with their improvisational performances . During the 1980s the Living Stage began to reach out extensively to local initiatives like The District 's Alcohol and Drug Abuse Services Administration and created their own Community Services Project in order to continue to bring theater and creativity to underserved sections of society . The Living Stage championed New Left ideals like equality and social justice throughout the Reagan years , despite some criticisms about their message being " anachronistic " . The Living Stage dissolved after 36 years and was a venture of Arena Stage .

'' Infra '' comprises music written for piano , electronics and string quintet , plus the full performance score and material that subsequently developed from the construction of the album .

On another aggregator website , Album of the Year , it holds the 4th position on a list of worst reviewed albums of 2014 . Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic gave the album 2.5 stars out of 5 saying that " Michele is not a natural pop star . This was true in 2009 when she debuted on '' Glee '' as Rachel Berry and it 's even clearer in 2014 . " Mike Ayers from '' Billboard '' gave a mostly positive review , saying , " Lyrically , '' Louder '' is rather one-sided , as she often sings about the perils of relationships , over and over , in ways that we 've all heard many times at this point . Still , it 's a solid effort that shows she has promise as a bonafide pop artist . " Sarah Rodman of '' The Boston Globe '' gave the album a mostly positive review , writing , " The Broadway veteran puts her mighty soprano through its paces on bouncy dance tracks , soaring ballads , and midtempo pop tunes where she straddles the line , mostly comfortably , between Katy Perry and Celine Dion . " Kyle Anderson of '' Entertainment Weekly '' gave the album a B - , writing , " It 's hard to be that mad at '' Louder '' , because it 's so admirably and lovingly crafted . There 's nothing wrong with Lea Michele 's debut , and that 's its biggest problem . While well curated and exquisitely executed , '' Louder '' is missing the visceral oomph that defines the gulf between superstars and the rest of the top 40 chum . " At '' USA Today '' , Jerry Shriver rated the album 2.5 stars out of four , and stated that " softer would have been a better approach . " He added that the song " Battlefield " points to a more promising direction . Kevin McFarland of '' The A.V. Club '' gave a C - rating , writing , " '' Louder '' , Michele 's debut solo album under her own name , does feature her distinctive talent as a vocalist . But the record is caught in an unfortunate stylistic limbo between fun-loving , youthful pop and the maturity of adult contemporary artists . " Jim Farber of the '' New York Daily News '' awarded the album two stars . He criticized , " Michele does n't so much sing as trumpet like an elephant eager for the charge . Her voice has more need than vulnerability , more anger than understanding . " Christopher R. Weingarten of '' Rolling Stone '' also gave a negative review , stating , " This album of insta-dated EDM-pop anthems and half-cocked bass drops probably wo n't help Michele 's cause . The songs about love 's ups and downs have a few memorable lyrics ( ' My heart 's too drunk to drive ' ) but not nearly enough .

The book is richly illustrated and the text contains numerous vivid and mellifluous descriptions and dialog . For example , upon meeting the top hat , the protagonist cries , " Thunder of Sebastopole ! " ; in another scene , he shouts , " A thousand Potemkins ! " Other characters in the book are " cutthroats " , " brigands " , a " fainting contessa " , and a " dashing cadet " . The author 's interest in such colorful prose was explained by Selma G. Lanes in the Atlantic Monthly : " Ungerer feels strongly that children enjoy unfamiliar words and euphonious , mystifying phrases . " The setting for The Hat is nineteenth century Italy , and was described by Sydney D. Long in the Horn Book Magazine as " a never - never land ... , the comic - opera pictures of The Hat are full of mandolin - playing musicians , splashing fountains , and apple - cheeked peasant lasses .

The season was to be a promising one , filled with All - Star talent at several positions . It was believed over the offseason , the Suns would be able to better incorporate Shaquille O'Neal , who necessitated changes to both the offense and defense after being obtained in a trade one season ago . It was also the first season head coach Terry Porter had been able to use the summer to implement his defensive approach for a team which had in seasons past scored a large number of their points off fast breaks and early in the shot clock . Sensing a need for change , team management traded for scorer Jason Richardson in December , but this did not appear to immediately reinvigorate an offense that had recently led the league in points per game . However , after Phoenix went 28 – 23 to start the season , Suns assistant Alvin Gentry was named to replace Porter as head coach . Less than one week after the All - Star Game , Amar ' e Stoudemire sustained a season - ending eye injury while the improvement of the team never fully came . The Suns finished 46 – 36 , second in the Pacific division but out the playoffs for the first time since Steve Nash rejoined the Suns in the 2004 – 05 season . The Suns had the best team offensive rating in the NBA .

High Dive , Lee 's third novel , was published in the UK in 2015 and re-imagined events surrounding the Brighton hotel bombing by the Provisional Irish Republican Army in 1984 , an attempt to assassinate then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher '' The Sunday Times '' called it " an extraordinary performance : vividly written , painfully human and fully fleshing the inner lives of its characters " . '' The Guardian '' , after publishing a review by Jake Arnott , named it among their " books of the year " and stated that it was " a multi-voiced epic that leads towards a stunning finale . " '' The Independent '' , in its review , called Lee " a wordsmith of incomparable eloquence " and also chose it as one of their books of the year . Not all critics were as positive . A negative review of the novel was published in '' The Financial Times '' , which argued that " the novel suffers from some bum notes ... the thoughts of the characters meander in ways that are n't always interesting or revealing . " In an interview with Mariella Frostrup for the BBC , Lee defended his decision to tell the story of the real-life bombing through largely fictional characters

                CONTEXT=The album received mixed reviews from music critics . According to review aggregator Metacritic , the album has a score of 48/100 based on 8 reviews , indicating " mixed or average reviews " . On another aggregator website , Album of the Year , it holds the 4th position on a list of worst reviewed albums of 2014 . Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic gave the album 2.5 stars out of 5 saying that " Michele is not a natural pop star . This was true in 2009 when she debuted on '' Glee '' as Rachel Berry and it 's even clearer in 2014 . " Mike Ayers from '' Billboard '' gave a mostly positive review , saying , " Lyrically , '' Louder '' is rather one-sided , as she often sings about the perils of relationships , over and over , in ways that we 've all heard many times at this point . Still , it 's a solid effort that shows she has promise as a bonafide pop artist . " Sarah Rodman of '' The Boston Globe '' gave the album a mostly positive review , writing , " The Broadway veteran puts her mighty soprano through its paces on bouncy dance tracks , soaring ballads , and midtempo pop tunes where she straddles the line , mostly comfortably , between Katy Perry and Celine Dion . " Kyle Anderson of '' Entertainment Weekly '' gave the album a B - , writing , " It 's hard to be that mad at '' Louder '' , because it 's so admirably and lovingly crafted . There 's nothing wrong with Lea Michele 's debut , and that 's its biggest problem . While well curated and exquisitely executed , '' Louder '' is missing the visceral oomph that defines the gulf between superstars and the rest of the top 40 chum . " At '' USA Today '' , Jerry Shriver rated the album 2.5 stars out of four , and stated that " softer would have been a better approach . " He added that the song " Battlefield " points to a more promising direction . Kevin McFarland of '' The A.V. Club '' gave a C - rating , writing , " '' Louder '' , Michele 's debut solo album under her own name , does feature her distinctive talent as a vocalist . But the record is caught in an unfortunate stylistic limbo between fun-loving , youthful pop and the maturity of adult contemporary artists . " Jim Farber of the '' New York Daily News '' awarded the album two stars . He criticized , " Michele does n't so much sing as trumpet like an elephant eager for the charge . Her voice has more need than vulnerability , more anger than understanding . " Christopher R. Weingarten of '' Rolling Stone '' also gave a negative review , stating , " This album of insta-dated EDM-pop anthems and half-cocked bass drops probably wo n't help Michele 's cause . The songs about love 's ups and downs have a few memorable lyrics ( ' My heart 's too drunk to drive ' ) but not nearly enough . " '' Louder '' was nominated for World 's Best Album at the 2014 World Music Awards , held in Monaco on May 27 , 2014

                CONTEXT=The '' All Eyes on Sharon Tate '' documentary was used to publicize the film . Its 14 minutes consisted of a number of scenes depicting Tate filming '' Eye of the Devil '' , dancing in nightclubs , and sightseeing around London , and also contained a brief interview with her . Asked about her acting ambitions , she replied , " I do n't fool myself . I ca n't see myself doing Shakespeare . " She spoke of her hopes of finding a niche in comedy , and in other interviews she expressed her desire to become " a light comedienne in the Carole Lombard style " . She discussed the type of contemporary actress she wanted to emulate and explained that there were two in particular that she was influenced by : Faye Dunaway and Catherine Deneuve . Of the latter , she said , " I 'd like to be an American Catherine Deneuve . She plays beautiful , sensitive , deep parts with a little bit of intelligence behind them . " Later in the year , '' Valley of the Dolls '' opened to almost uniformly negative reviews . Bosley Crowther wrote in '' The New York Times '' , " all a fairly respectful admirer of movies can do is laugh at it and turn away " . '' Newsweek '' said that the film " has no more sense of its own ludicrousness than a village idiot stumbling in manure " , but a later article read : " Astoundingly photogenic , infinitely curvaceous , Sharon Tate is one of the most smashing young things to hit Hollywood in a long time . " The three lead actresses were castigated in numerous publications , including '' The Saturday Review '' , which wrote , " Ten years ago ... Parkins , Duke , and Tate would more likely have been playing the hat check girls than movie-queens ; they are totally lacking in style , authority , or charm . " '' The Hollywood Reporter '' provided some positive comments , such as , " Sharon Tate emerges as the film 's most sympathetic character ... William H. Daniels ' photographic caress of her faultless face and enormous absorbent eyes is stunning . " Roger Ebert of the '' Chicago Sun-Times '' praised Tate as " a wonder to behold " , but after describing the dialogue in one scene as " the most offensive and appalling vulgarity ever thrown up by any civilization " , concluded that , " I will be unable to take her any more seriously as a sex symbol than Raquel Welch . " In late 1967 , Tate and Polanski returned to London and were frequent subjects of newspaper and magazine articles . Tate was depicted as being untraditional and modern , and was quoted as saying couples should live together before marrying . They were married in Chelsea , London , on January 20 , 1968 , with considerable publicity . Polanski was dressed in what the press described as " Edwardian finery " , while Tate was attired in a white minidress . The couple moved into Polanski 's mews house off Eaton Square in Belgravia , London . Photographer Peter Evans later described them as " the imperfect couple . They were the Douglas Fairbanks/Mary Pickford of our time ... Cool , nomadic , talented , and nicely shocking . " While Tate reportedly wanted a traditional marriage , Polanski remained somewhat promiscuous and described Tate 's attitude to his infidelity as " Sharon 's big hang-up " . He reminded Tate that she had promised that she would not try to change him . Tate accepted Polanski 's conditions , though she confided to friends that she hoped he would change . Peter Evans quoted Tate as saying , " We have a good arrangement . Roman lies to me and I pretend to believe him . " Polanski urged Tate to end her association with Martin Ransohoff , and Tate began to place less importance on her career until Polanski told her he wanted to be married to " a hippie , not a housewife . " The couple returned to Los Angeles and quickly became part of a social group that included some of the most successful young people in the film industry , including Warren Beatty , Jacqueline Bisset , Leslie Caron , Joan Collins , Mia Farrow , Jane Fonda , Peter Fonda , Laurence Harvey , Steve McQueen , Joanna Pettet and Peter Sellers ; older film stars like Yul Brynner , Kirk Douglas , Henry Fonda and Danny Kaye ; musicians such as Jim Morrison and The Mamas & the Papas ; and record producer Terry Melcher and his girlfriend , actress Candice Bergen . Jay Sebring remained one of the couple 's more frequent companions . Polanski 's circle of friends included people he had known since his youth in Poland such as Wojciech Frykowski and Frykowski 's girlfriend , coffee heiress Abigail Folger . Tate and Polanski moved into the Chateau Marmont Hotel in Los Angeles for a few months until they arranged to lease Patty Duke 's home on Summit Ridge Drive in Beverly Hills during the latter part of 1968 . The Polanski house was often full of strangers , and Tate regarded the casual atmosphere as part of the " free spirit " of the times , saying that she did not mind who came into her home as her motto was " live and let live . " Her close friend Leslie Caron later commented that the Polanskis were too trusting — " to the point of recklessness " — and that she had been alarmed by it

It featured the singles " Crazy Little Thing Called Love " and " Another One Bites the Dust " , both of which reached number one in the US . After attending a Queen concert in Los Angeles , Michael Jackson suggested to Mercury backstage that " Another One Bites the Dust " be released as a single , and in October 1980 it spent three weeks at number one . The album topped the '' Billboard '' 200 for five weeks , and sold over four million copies in the US . It was also the first appearance of a synthesiser on a Queen album . Heretofore , their albums featured a distinctive " No Synthesisers ! " sleeve note . The note is widely assumed to reflect an anti-synth , pro- " hard " - rock stance by the band , but was later revealed by producer Roy Thomas Baker to be an attempt to clarify that those albums ' multi-layered solos were created with guitars , not synths , as record company executives kept assuming at the time . In September 1980 , Queen performed three sold-out shows at Madison Square Garden . In 1980 , Queen also released the soundtrack they had recorded for '' Flash Gordon '' . At the 1981 American Music Awards in January , " Another One Bites the Dust " won the award for Favorite Pop/Rock Single , and Queen were nominated for Favorite Pop/Rock Band , Duo , or Group

The characters suffer from their knowledge of having betrayed a friend and left him to his fate , thus violating their own honor code when it suits them ( " $ 10,000 cuts an awful lot of family ties " ) . However , Bishop says , " When you side with a man , you stay with him , and if you ca n't do that you 're like some animal . " Such oppositional ideas lead to the film 's violent conclusion , as the remaining men find their abandonment of Angel intolerable . Bishop remembers his betrayals , most notably when he deserts Deke Thornton ( in flashback ) when the law catches up to them and when he abandons Crazy Lee at the railroad office after the robbery ( ostensibly to guard the hostages ) . Critic David Weddle writes that , " like that of Conrad 's '' Lord Jim '' , Pike Bishop 's heroism is propelled by overwhelming guilt and a despairing death wish . " Vincent Canby began his review by calling the film " very beautiful and the first truly interesting American-made Western in years . It 's also so full of violence — of an intensity that can hardly be supported by the story — that it 's going to prompt a lot of people who do not know the real effect of movie violence ( as I do not ) to write automatic condemnations of it . " He observed , " Although the movie 's conventional and poetic action sequences are extraordinarily good and its landscapes beautifully photographed ... it is most interesting in its almost jolly account of chaos , corruption , and defeat " . About the actors , he commented particularly on William Holden : " After years of giving bored performances in boring movies , Holden comes back gallantly in '' The Wild Bunch '' . He looks older and tired , but he has style , both as a man and as a movie character who persists in doing what he 's always done , not because he really wants the money but because there 's simply nothing else to do . " '' TIME '' also liked Holden 's performance , describing it as his best since '' Stalag 17 '' ( a 1953 film that earned Holden an Oscar ) , noting Robert Ryan gave " the screen performance of his career " , and concluding that " '' The Wild Bunch '' contains faults and mistakes " ( such as flashbacks " introduced with surprising clumsiness " ) , but " its accomplishments are more than sufficient to confirm that Peckinpah , along with Stanley Kubrick and Arthur Penn , belongs with the best of the newer generation of American filmmakers . " In a 2002 retrospective Roger Ebert , who " saw the original version at the world premiere in 1969 , during the golden age of the junket , when Warner Bros. screened five of its new films in the Bahamas for 450 critics and reporters " , said that back then he had publicly declared the film a masterpiece during the junket 's press conference , prompted by comments from " a reporter from the '' Reader 's Digest '' who got up to ask ' Why was this film ever made ? ' " He compared the film to '' Pulp Fiction '' : " praised and condemned with equal vehemence . " " What '' Citizen Kane '' was to movie lovers in 1941 , '' The Wild Bunch '' was to cineastes in 1969 , " wrote film critic Michael Sragow , who added that Peckinpah had " produced an American movie that equals or surpasses the best of Kurosawa : the Gotterdammerung of Westerns "

Peter Evans quoted Tate as saying , " We have a good arrangement . Roman lies to me and I pretend to believe him . " Polanski urged Tate to end her association with Martin Ransohoff , and Tate began to place less importance on her career until Polanski told her he wanted to be married to " a hippie , not a housewife .

                CONTEXT=Living Stage Theatre Company was a theatre for social change founded in 1966 by Robert A. Alexander ( 1929 – 2008 ) . He served as the artistic director until 1995 . Located in Washington , D.C. , this professional improvisational theater offered participatory workshops to children , youth , teachers , parents , and community members . Living Stage ’s main philosophy was based in the belief that every one is born an artist and the act of creation is the ultimate act of self - affirmation . The company 's mission was to transform individuals and communities through creative empowerment . The projects that the Living Stage put on typically dealt with controversial and sensitive topics like race , economic inequality , the dangers of an overzealous American foreign policy , the atom bomb , violence , and freedom . The " Baltimore Incident " of 1971 is an excellent example of how controversial these productions could be . No matter how mixed opinions were , the Living Stage always elicited a reaction with their improvisational performances . During the 1980s the Living Stage began to reach out extensively to local initiatives like The District 's Alcohol and Drug Abuse Services Administration and created their own Community Services Project in order to continue to bring theater and creativity to underserved sections of society . The Living Stage championed New Left ideals like equality and social justice throughout the Reagan years , despite some criticisms about their message being " anachronistic " . The Living Stage dissolved after 36 years and was a venture of Arena Stage .

On behalf of women directors , cinematographer , and producers , I resent the travesty of calling that a tribute . " Likewise , President of the National Organization for Women 's Los Angeles chapter Tammy Bruce chastised ceremony 's feminist tribute as " one of the most hypocritical , patronizing things I saw in my whole life . " In response , Gil Cates responded towards the criticism of the theme stating , " The theme developed and raised consciousness in a way that I think is positive , not only for the individual in general but for individual women specifically . " He also quoted an ancient Chinese proverb later made famous by former U.S. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt saying , " It is better to light one candle than to curse the darkness " Despite the adverse reception , the ABC broadcast drew in an average of 45.7 million people over its length , which was a 3 % increase from the previous year 's ceremony . The show also drew higher Nielsen ratings compared to the previous ceremony with 31.2 % of households watching over a 51 share . It also drew a higher 18 – 49 demo rating with a 20.1 rating among viewers in that demographic

                CONTEXT=Betrayal is the secondary theme of '' The Wild Bunch '' . The characters suffer from their knowledge of having betrayed a friend and left him to his fate , thus violating their own honor code when it suits them ( " $ 10,000 cuts an awful lot of family ties " ) . However , Bishop says , " When you side with a man , you stay with him , and if you ca n't do that you 're like some animal . " Such oppositional ideas lead to the film 's violent conclusion , as the remaining men find their abandonment of Angel intolerable . Bishop remembers his betrayals , most notably when he deserts Deke Thornton ( in flashback ) when the law catches up to them and when he abandons Crazy Lee at the railroad office after the robbery ( ostensibly to guard the hostages ) . Critic David Weddle writes that , " like that of Conrad 's '' Lord Jim '' , Pike Bishop 's heroism is propelled by overwhelming guilt and a despairing death wish . " Vincent Canby began his review by calling the film " very beautiful and the first truly interesting American-made Western in years . It 's also so full of violence — of an intensity that can hardly be supported by the story — that it 's going to prompt a lot of people who do not know the real effect of movie violence ( as I do not ) to write automatic condemnations of it . " He observed , " Although the movie 's conventional and poetic action sequences are extraordinarily good and its landscapes beautifully photographed ... it is most interesting in its almost jolly account of chaos , corruption , and defeat " . About the actors , he commented particularly on William Holden : " After years of giving bored performances in boring movies , Holden comes back gallantly in '' The Wild Bunch '' . He looks older and tired , but he has style , both as a man and as a movie character who persists in doing what he 's always done , not because he really wants the money but because there 's simply nothing else to do . " '' TIME '' also liked Holden 's performance , describing it as his best since '' Stalag 17 '' ( a 1953 film that earned Holden an Oscar ) , noting Robert Ryan gave " the screen performance of his career " , and concluding that " '' The Wild Bunch '' contains faults and mistakes " ( such as flashbacks " introduced with surprising clumsiness " ) , but " its accomplishments are more than sufficient to confirm that Peckinpah , along with Stanley Kubrick and Arthur Penn , belongs with the best of the newer generation of American filmmakers . " In a 2002 retrospective Roger Ebert , who " saw the original version at the world premiere in 1969 , during the golden age of the junket , when Warner Bros. screened five of its new films in the Bahamas for 450 critics and reporters " , said that back then he had publicly declared the film a masterpiece during the junket 's press conference , prompted by comments from " a reporter from the '' Reader 's Digest '' who got up to ask ' Why was this film ever made ? ' " He compared the film to '' Pulp Fiction '' : " praised and condemned with equal vehemence . " " What '' Citizen Kane '' was to movie lovers in 1941 , '' The Wild Bunch '' was to cineastes in 1969 , " wrote film critic Michael Sragow , who added that Peckinpah had " produced an American movie that equals or surpasses the best of Kurosawa : the Gotterdammerung of Westerns "

" Michael Cragg of '' The Guardian '' said it had " everything you 'd want to hear in a pop song in 2012 " and likened Little Mix 's " ridiculous vocal runs " to those of Aguilera . Another reviewer from '' The Guardian '' commented , " Blame Adele 's ' Rolling in the Deep ' for the thumping beat , but if you really want some girl-band pop , these '' X Factor '' winners will just about satisfy . " In '' The Irish Times '' , Ailbhe Malone described the song as " a stomper " akin to Beyoncé 's " Get Me Bodied " and Lisa Lopes ' " The Block Party " for its harmonies , clapping and " '' X Factor '' s worth of attitude " , while Eoin Butler gave " Wings " three stars out of five , calling it a " a stomper ... in the vein of Beyoncé 's ' Single Ladies ' .

                CONTEXT=The '' All Eyes on Sharon Tate '' documentary was used to publicize the film . Its 14 minutes consisted of a number of scenes depicting Tate filming '' Eye of the Devil '' , dancing in nightclubs , and sightseeing around London , and also contained a brief interview with her . Asked about her acting ambitions , she replied , " I do n't fool myself . I ca n't see myself doing Shakespeare . " She spoke of her hopes of finding a niche in comedy , and in other interviews she expressed her desire to become " a light comedienne in the Carole Lombard style " . She discussed the type of contemporary actress she wanted to emulate and explained that there were two in particular that she was influenced by : Faye Dunaway and Catherine Deneuve . Of the latter , she said , " I 'd like to be an American Catherine Deneuve . She plays beautiful , sensitive , deep parts with a little bit of intelligence behind them . " Later in the year , '' Valley of the Dolls '' opened to almost uniformly negative reviews . Bosley Crowther wrote in '' The New York Times '' , " all a fairly respectful admirer of movies can do is laugh at it and turn away " . '' Newsweek '' said that the film " has no more sense of its own ludicrousness than a village idiot stumbling in manure " , but a later article read : " Astoundingly photogenic , infinitely curvaceous , Sharon Tate is one of the most smashing young things to hit Hollywood in a long time . " The three lead actresses were castigated in numerous publications , including '' The Saturday Review '' , which wrote , " Ten years ago ... Parkins , Duke , and Tate would more likely have been playing the hat check girls than movie-queens ; they are totally lacking in style , authority , or charm . " '' The Hollywood Reporter '' provided some positive comments , such as , " Sharon Tate emerges as the film 's most sympathetic character ... William H. Daniels ' photographic caress of her faultless face and enormous absorbent eyes is stunning . " Roger Ebert of the '' Chicago Sun-Times '' praised Tate as " a wonder to behold " , but after describing the dialogue in one scene as " the most offensive and appalling vulgarity ever thrown up by any civilization " , concluded that , " I will be unable to take her any more seriously as a sex symbol than Raquel Welch . " In late 1967 , Tate and Polanski returned to London and were frequent subjects of newspaper and magazine articles . Tate was depicted as being untraditional and modern , and was quoted as saying couples should live together before marrying . They were married in Chelsea , London , on January 20 , 1968 , with considerable publicity . Polanski was dressed in what the press described as " Edwardian finery " , while Tate was attired in a white minidress . The couple moved into Polanski 's mews house off Eaton Square in Belgravia , London . Photographer Peter Evans later described them as " the imperfect couple . They were the Douglas Fairbanks/Mary Pickford of our time ... Cool , nomadic , talented , and nicely shocking . " While Tate reportedly wanted a traditional marriage , Polanski remained somewhat promiscuous and described Tate 's attitude to his infidelity as " Sharon 's big hang-up " . He reminded Tate that she had promised that she would not try to change him . Tate accepted Polanski 's conditions , though she confided to friends that she hoped he would change . Peter Evans quoted Tate as saying , " We have a good arrangement . Roman lies to me and I pretend to believe him . " Polanski urged Tate to end her association with Martin Ransohoff , and Tate began to place less importance on her career until Polanski told her he wanted to be married to " a hippie , not a housewife . " The couple returned to Los Angeles and quickly became part of a social group that included some of the most successful young people in the film industry , including Warren Beatty , Jacqueline Bisset , Leslie Caron , Joan Collins , Mia Farrow , Jane Fonda , Peter Fonda , Laurence Harvey , Steve McQueen , Joanna Pettet and Peter Sellers ; older film stars like Yul Brynner , Kirk Douglas , Henry Fonda and Danny Kaye ; musicians such as Jim Morrison and The Mamas & the Papas ; and record producer Terry Melcher and his girlfriend , actress Candice Bergen . Jay Sebring remained one of the couple 's more frequent companions . Polanski 's circle of friends included people he had known since his youth in Poland such as Wojciech Frykowski and Frykowski 's girlfriend , coffee heiress Abigail Folger . Tate and Polanski moved into the Chateau Marmont Hotel in Los Angeles for a few months until they arranged to lease Patty Duke 's home on Summit Ridge Drive in Beverly Hills during the latter part of 1968 . The Polanski house was often full of strangers , and Tate regarded the casual atmosphere as part of the " free spirit " of the times , saying that she did not mind who came into her home as her motto was " live and let live . " Her close friend Leslie Caron later commented that the Polanskis were too trusting — " to the point of recklessness " — and that she had been alarmed by it

On another aggregator website , Album of the Year , it holds the 4th position on a list of worst reviewed albums of 2014 . Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic gave the album 2.5 stars out of 5 saying that " Michele is not a natural pop star . This was true in 2009 when she debuted on '' Glee '' as Rachel Berry and it 's even clearer in 2014 . " Mike Ayers from '' Billboard '' gave a mostly positive review , saying , " Lyrically , '' Louder '' is rather one-sided , as she often sings about the perils of relationships , over and over , in ways that we 've all heard many times at this point . Still , it 's a solid effort that shows she has promise as a bonafide pop artist . " Sarah Rodman of '' The Boston Globe '' gave the album a mostly positive review , writing , " The Broadway veteran puts her mighty soprano through its paces on bouncy dance tracks , soaring ballads , and midtempo pop tunes where she straddles the line , mostly comfortably , between Katy Perry and Celine Dion . " Kyle Anderson of '' Entertainment Weekly '' gave the album a B - , writing , " It 's hard to be that mad at '' Louder '' , because it 's so admirably and lovingly crafted . There 's nothing wrong with Lea Michele 's debut , and that 's its biggest problem . While well curated and exquisitely executed , '' Louder '' is missing the visceral oomph that defines the gulf between superstars and the rest of the top 40 chum . " At '' USA Today '' , Jerry Shriver rated the album 2.5 stars out of four , and stated that " softer would have been a better approach . " He added that the song " Battlefield " points to a more promising direction . Kevin McFarland of '' The A.V. Club '' gave a C - rating , writing , " '' Louder '' , Michele 's debut solo album under her own name , does feature her distinctive talent as a vocalist . But the record is caught in an unfortunate stylistic limbo between fun-loving , youthful pop and the maturity of adult contemporary artists . " Jim Farber of the '' New York Daily News '' awarded the album two stars . He criticized , " Michele does n't so much sing as trumpet like an elephant eager for the charge . Her voice has more need than vulnerability , more anger than understanding . " Christopher R. Weingarten of '' Rolling Stone '' also gave a negative review , stating , " This album of insta-dated EDM-pop anthems and half-cocked bass drops probably wo n't help Michele 's cause .

                CONTEXT=The album received mixed reviews from music critics . According to review aggregator Metacritic , the album has a score of 48/100 based on 8 reviews , indicating " mixed or average reviews " . On another aggregator website , Album of the Year , it holds the 4th position on a list of worst reviewed albums of 2014 . Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic gave the album 2.5 stars out of 5 saying that " Michele is not a natural pop star . This was true in 2009 when she debuted on '' Glee '' as Rachel Berry and it 's even clearer in 2014 . " Mike Ayers from '' Billboard '' gave a mostly positive review , saying , " Lyrically , '' Louder '' is rather one-sided , as she often sings about the perils of relationships , over and over , in ways that we 've all heard many times at this point . Still , it 's a solid effort that shows she has promise as a bonafide pop artist . " Sarah Rodman of '' The Boston Globe '' gave the album a mostly positive review , writing , " The Broadway veteran puts her mighty soprano through its paces on bouncy dance tracks , soaring ballads , and midtempo pop tunes where she straddles the line , mostly comfortably , between Katy Perry and Celine Dion . " Kyle Anderson of '' Entertainment Weekly '' gave the album a B - , writing , " It 's hard to be that mad at '' Louder '' , because it 's so admirably and lovingly crafted . There 's nothing wrong with Lea Michele 's debut , and that 's its biggest problem . While well curated and exquisitely executed , '' Louder '' is missing the visceral oomph that defines the gulf between superstars and the rest of the top 40 chum . " At '' USA Today '' , Jerry Shriver rated the album 2.5 stars out of four , and stated that " softer would have been a better approach . " He added that the song " Battlefield " points to a more promising direction . Kevin McFarland of '' The A.V. Club '' gave a C - rating , writing , " '' Louder '' , Michele 's debut solo album under her own name , does feature her distinctive talent as a vocalist . But the record is caught in an unfortunate stylistic limbo between fun-loving , youthful pop and the maturity of adult contemporary artists . " Jim Farber of the '' New York Daily News '' awarded the album two stars . He criticized , " Michele does n't so much sing as trumpet like an elephant eager for the charge . Her voice has more need than vulnerability , more anger than understanding . " Christopher R. Weingarten of '' Rolling Stone '' also gave a negative review , stating , " This album of insta-dated EDM-pop anthems and half-cocked bass drops probably wo n't help Michele 's cause . The songs about love 's ups and downs have a few memorable lyrics ( ' My heart 's too drunk to drive ' ) but not nearly enough . " '' Louder '' was nominated for World 's Best Album at the 2014 World Music Awards , held in Monaco on May 27 , 2014

                CONTEXT=The '' All Eyes on Sharon Tate '' documentary was used to publicize the film . Its 14 minutes consisted of a number of scenes depicting Tate filming '' Eye of the Devil '' , dancing in nightclubs , and sightseeing around London , and also contained a brief interview with her . Asked about her acting ambitions , she replied , " I do n't fool myself . I ca n't see myself doing Shakespeare . " She spoke of her hopes of finding a niche in comedy , and in other interviews she expressed her desire to become " a light comedienne in the Carole Lombard style " . She discussed the type of contemporary actress she wanted to emulate and explained that there were two in particular that she was influenced by : Faye Dunaway and Catherine Deneuve . Of the latter , she said , " I 'd like to be an American Catherine Deneuve . She plays beautiful , sensitive , deep parts with a little bit of intelligence behind them . " Later in the year , '' Valley of the Dolls '' opened to almost uniformly negative reviews . Bosley Crowther wrote in '' The New York Times '' , " all a fairly respectful admirer of movies can do is laugh at it and turn away " . '' Newsweek '' said that the film " has no more sense of its own ludicrousness than a village idiot stumbling in manure " , but a later article read : " Astoundingly photogenic , infinitely curvaceous , Sharon Tate is one of the most smashing young things to hit Hollywood in a long time . " The three lead actresses were castigated in numerous publications , including '' The Saturday Review '' , which wrote , " Ten years ago ... Parkins , Duke , and Tate would more likely have been playing the hat check girls than movie-queens ; they are totally lacking in style , authority , or charm . " '' The Hollywood Reporter '' provided some positive comments , such as , " Sharon Tate emerges as the film 's most sympathetic character ... William H. Daniels ' photographic caress of her faultless face and enormous absorbent eyes is stunning . " Roger Ebert of the '' Chicago Sun-Times '' praised Tate as " a wonder to behold " , but after describing the dialogue in one scene as " the most offensive and appalling vulgarity ever thrown up by any civilization " , concluded that , " I will be unable to take her any more seriously as a sex symbol than Raquel Welch . " In late 1967 , Tate and Polanski returned to London and were frequent subjects of newspaper and magazine articles . Tate was depicted as being untraditional and modern , and was quoted as saying couples should live together before marrying . They were married in Chelsea , London , on January 20 , 1968 , with considerable publicity . Polanski was dressed in what the press described as " Edwardian finery " , while Tate was attired in a white minidress . The couple moved into Polanski 's mews house off Eaton Square in Belgravia , London . Photographer Peter Evans later described them as " the imperfect couple . They were the Douglas Fairbanks/Mary Pickford of our time ... Cool , nomadic , talented , and nicely shocking . " While Tate reportedly wanted a traditional marriage , Polanski remained somewhat promiscuous and described Tate 's attitude to his infidelity as " Sharon 's big hang-up " . He reminded Tate that she had promised that she would not try to change him . Tate accepted Polanski 's conditions , though she confided to friends that she hoped he would change . Peter Evans quoted Tate as saying , " We have a good arrangement . Roman lies to me and I pretend to believe him . " Polanski urged Tate to end her association with Martin Ransohoff , and Tate began to place less importance on her career until Polanski told her he wanted to be married to " a hippie , not a housewife . " The couple returned to Los Angeles and quickly became part of a social group that included some of the most successful young people in the film industry , including Warren Beatty , Jacqueline Bisset , Leslie Caron , Joan Collins , Mia Farrow , Jane Fonda , Peter Fonda , Laurence Harvey , Steve McQueen , Joanna Pettet and Peter Sellers ; older film stars like Yul Brynner , Kirk Douglas , Henry Fonda and Danny Kaye ; musicians such as Jim Morrison and The Mamas & the Papas ; and record producer Terry Melcher and his girlfriend , actress Candice Bergen . Jay Sebring remained one of the couple 's more frequent companions . Polanski 's circle of friends included people he had known since his youth in Poland such as Wojciech Frykowski and Frykowski 's girlfriend , coffee heiress Abigail Folger . Tate and Polanski moved into the Chateau Marmont Hotel in Los Angeles for a few months until they arranged to lease Patty Duke 's home on Summit Ridge Drive in Beverly Hills during the latter part of 1968 . The Polanski house was often full of strangers , and Tate regarded the casual atmosphere as part of the " free spirit " of the times , saying that she did not mind who came into her home as her motto was " live and let live . " Her close friend Leslie Caron later commented that the Polanskis were too trusting — " to the point of recklessness " — and that she had been alarmed by it

                CONTEXT=Several side sketches are interwoven with the police drama . In the first , a commercial for Dead Cat Soap segues into a soap opera spoof , starring Peggy . We learn that Random is rarely home , Peggy is having an affair , and Skip 's ( " Skipper " to his mother ) sexual orientation is a scandal . In the second , Kim Coolzip presents a seductive commercial for liquid meat , which segues into her appearance on a charity fund-raising telethon . The third is the game show , in which Skip Coolzip " gives back " to Native Americans his family 's car , then his father 's squad car ( " the black screamer " ) , and finally , " everything . " He is also assigned , with his sister , to take over the Academy Awards celebration " with these stirring words : ' Eat flaming death , fascist media pigs .

While accepting an award for a police/family drama called " Squat ! , " which stars their parents and seems identical to the show on the first side of the album , Skip and Kim Coolzip reveal a gun . They demand that the President of the United States appear in Hollywood " with a plane full of cash and all those broken treaties , " or they will shoot the nominees one by one in alphabetical order . This sketch was inspired by Sacheen Littlefeather 's appearance at the 1973 Academy Awards

                CONTEXT=Betrayal is the secondary theme of '' The Wild Bunch '' . The characters suffer from their knowledge of having betrayed a friend and left him to his fate , thus violating their own honor code when it suits them ( " $ 10,000 cuts an awful lot of family ties " ) . However , Bishop says , " When you side with a man , you stay with him , and if you ca n't do that you 're like some animal . " Such oppositional ideas lead to the film 's violent conclusion , as the remaining men find their abandonment of Angel intolerable . Bishop remembers his betrayals , most notably when he deserts Deke Thornton ( in flashback ) when the law catches up to them and when he abandons Crazy Lee at the railroad office after the robbery ( ostensibly to guard the hostages ) . Critic David Weddle writes that , " like that of Conrad 's '' Lord Jim '' , Pike Bishop 's heroism is propelled by overwhelming guilt and a despairing death wish . " Vincent Canby began his review by calling the film " very beautiful and the first truly interesting American-made Western in years . It 's also so full of violence — of an intensity that can hardly be supported by the story — that it 's going to prompt a lot of people who do not know the real effect of movie violence ( as I do not ) to write automatic condemnations of it . " He observed , " Although the movie 's conventional and poetic action sequences are extraordinarily good and its landscapes beautifully photographed ... it is most interesting in its almost jolly account of chaos , corruption , and defeat " . About the actors , he commented particularly on William Holden : " After years of giving bored performances in boring movies , Holden comes back gallantly in '' The Wild Bunch '' . He looks older and tired , but he has style , both as a man and as a movie character who persists in doing what he 's always done , not because he really wants the money but because there 's simply nothing else to do . " '' TIME '' also liked Holden 's performance , describing it as his best since '' Stalag 17 '' ( a 1953 film that earned Holden an Oscar ) , noting Robert Ryan gave " the screen performance of his career " , and concluding that " '' The Wild Bunch '' contains faults and mistakes " ( such as flashbacks " introduced with surprising clumsiness " ) , but " its accomplishments are more than sufficient to confirm that Peckinpah , along with Stanley Kubrick and Arthur Penn , belongs with the best of the newer generation of American filmmakers . " In a 2002 retrospective Roger Ebert , who " saw the original version at the world premiere in 1969 , during the golden age of the junket , when Warner Bros. screened five of its new films in the Bahamas for 450 critics and reporters " , said that back then he had publicly declared the film a masterpiece during the junket 's press conference , prompted by comments from " a reporter from the '' Reader 's Digest '' who got up to ask ' Why was this film ever made ? ' " He compared the film to '' Pulp Fiction '' : " praised and condemned with equal vehemence . " " What '' Citizen Kane '' was to movie lovers in 1941 , '' The Wild Bunch '' was to cineastes in 1969 , " wrote film critic Michael Sragow , who added that Peckinpah had " produced an American movie that equals or surpasses the best of Kurosawa : the Gotterdammerung of Westerns "

Richard Harrington of '' The Washington Post '' deemed the song " a powerful exploration of exhaustion and depression . " Alex Pappademas , writing for '' Spin '' , compared the song to the music of Weezer . Katy Kroll of '' Billboard '' recognized it among her top 10 singles of 2000 , calling it " a good old-fashioned depressing song with mainstream flair . " Geoff Boucher , writing for the '' Los Angeles Times '' , called it " a poignant essay on a teen mulling over suicide " ; conversely , Steve Appleford of the '' Los Angeles Times '' dubbed it a " moving if unremarkable examination . " Scott Mervis of the '' Pittsburgh Post-Gazette '' called it a " rare departure from the usual Blink fare . " Writers for '' The A.V. Club '' listed it among other suicide-related songs in 2009 , describing it as " surprisingly affecting , especially when the band reaches the bombastic chorus , and when the song describes suicide 's crushing aftermath . " In a retrospective review , Chris Payne of '' Billboard '' wrote , " Stylistically , it 's also a Blink breakthrough : rather than putting their heads down and plowing through at breakneck speed , the band dials back the verses and interludes to let them breathe a bit . The resulting chorus achieves an arena-worthy feel not achieved anywhere else on '' Enema of the State '' . " The song caused a controversy in 2000 when it was set to replay indefinitely on a nearby stereo as 17-year-old Greg Barnes , a teenager who attended Columbine High School and had lost one of his best friends in the massacre the previous year , hanged himself in the garage of his family 's home . Both Hoppus and DeLonge were sympathetic but stressed the song 's meaning during an MTV News interview in 2001 : Hoppus also told interviewers that he received fan mail following the song 's release from fans that had contemplated suicide , but decided not to go through with it after hearing the song . '' Rolling Stone '' compared the controversy to that of Ozzy Osbourne 's " Suicide Solution " , which similarly was playing as a teen committed suicide

' " In a track-by-track review by '' Billboard '' , the song was given a positive response and explained as " So returns the warped sonar synth effect heard on hits like ' Numb ' , and while it arrives in the opening seconds amid a rush of heavy guitars , ' Until It 's Gone ' quickly turns into a philosophical electro-rock mood piece . The buildup of blips in the bridge hints at a coming bass drop , but then the guitars kick back in , and Bennington belts out his clichéd lyrics for the middle schoolers in the cheap seats who do n't know any better . " A lyric video to accompany the track was premiered on YouTube on May 5 , 2014 . Directed by Austin Saya , the three-minute video was shot in Los Angeles , California .

The album topped the '' Billboard '' 200 for five weeks , and sold over four million copies in the US . It was also the first appearance of a synthesiser on a Queen album . Heretofore , their albums featured a distinctive " No Synthesisers ! " sleeve note . The note is widely assumed to reflect an anti-synth , pro- " hard " - rock stance by the band , but was later revealed by producer Roy Thomas Baker to be an attempt to clarify that those albums ' multi-layered solos were created with guitars , not synths , as record company executives kept assuming at the time . In September 1980 , Queen performed three sold-out shows at Madison Square Garden . In 1980 , Queen also released the soundtrack they had recorded for '' Flash Gordon '' . At the 1981 American Music Awards in January , " Another One Bites the Dust " won the award for Favorite Pop/Rock Single , and Queen were nominated for Favorite Pop/Rock Band , Duo , or Group

For its year-end list of " The 100 Best Tracks of 2014 " , '' Pitchfork '' ranked the song at number 23 . Also commenting on Lamar , '' Billboard '' 's Chris Payne wrote , " There are n't many A-list rappers who could handle a beat like this , but Kendrick is clearly one of them . " '' Rolling Stone '' editor Jon Dolan gave the song three-and-a-half out of five stars , commenting " Over offhandedly lovely , warp-speed psychedelic soul-jazz , Lamar unleashes a word-mad waterfall with a worried emotional core ( " analyze my demise I say I 'm super-anxious " , he raps ) . " '' Consequence of Sound '' editor Nina Corcoran wrote : " when combined with one of Lamar ’s hottest verses to date ( before '' To Pimp a Butterfly '' ) , the song explodes . But it does n’t stop there . FlyLo shows off his talent by shifting gears post-Kendrick verse the only way you can : insane keys , double-time bass drum , and unrelenting hand claps . Eventually , it ’s all swallowed up in massive swelling synth and choral hums , fading to a beautiful , passionate outro .

The mourners ca n't see the children as they dance right out of the church and out onto a blacktop , but a group of other kids chases after them as they hop in a hearse and drive away .

                CONTEXT=Living Stage Theatre Company was a theatre for social change founded in 1966 by Robert A. Alexander ( 1929 – 2008 ) . He served as the artistic director until 1995 . Located in Washington , D.C. , this professional improvisational theater offered participatory workshops to children , youth , teachers , parents , and community members . Living Stage ’s main philosophy was based in the belief that every one is born an artist and the act of creation is the ultimate act of self - affirmation . The company 's mission was to transform individuals and communities through creative empowerment . The projects that the Living Stage put on typically dealt with controversial and sensitive topics like race , economic inequality , the dangers of an overzealous American foreign policy , the atom bomb , violence , and freedom . The " Baltimore Incident " of 1971 is an excellent example of how controversial these productions could be . No matter how mixed opinions were , the Living Stage always elicited a reaction with their improvisational performances . During the 1980s the Living Stage began to reach out extensively to local initiatives like The District 's Alcohol and Drug Abuse Services Administration and created their own Community Services Project in order to continue to bring theater and creativity to underserved sections of society . The Living Stage championed New Left ideals like equality and social justice throughout the Reagan years , despite some criticisms about their message being " anachronistic " . The Living Stage dissolved after 36 years and was a venture of Arena Stage .

                CONTEXT=Neutral - beam injection ( NBI ) is one method used to heat plasma inside a fusion device consisting in a beam of high - energy neutral particles that can enter the magnetic confinement field . When these neutral particles are ionized by collision with the plasma particles , they are kept in the plasma by the confining magnetic field and can transfer most of their energy by further collisions with the plasma . By tangential injection in the torus , neutral beams also provide momentum to the plasma and current drive , one essential feature for long pulses of burning plasmas . Neutral - beam injection is a flexible and reliable technique , which has been the main heating system on a large variety of fusion devices . To date , all NBI systems were based on positive precursor ion beams . In the 1990s there has been impressive progress in negative ion sources and accelerators with the construction of multi-megawatt negative - ion - based NBI systems at LHD ( H 0 , 180 keV ) and JT - 60U ( D 0 , 500 keV ) . The NBI designed for ITER is a substantial challenge ( D 0 , 1 MeV , 40 A ) and a prototype is being constructed to optimize its performance in view of the ITER future operations . Other ways to heat plasma for nuclear fusion include RF heating , electron cyclotron resonance heating ( ECRH ) , ion cyclotron resonance heating ( ICRH ) , and lower hybrid resonance heating ( LH ) .

The TAS - NY believed that the greatest threat to female travelers in the early twentieth century was white slave trafficking , defined as the coercion of " white " women into prostitution and their subsequent sale to procurers or male clients . Agents of the Travelers Aid Society patrolled Grand Central Terminal and Pennsylvania Station , as well as the city 's piers where transatlantic ocean liners docked , looking for women who they identified as vulnerable .

He also questioned the purpose of the " Year of the Woman " theme writing , " The Oscar show itself seemed at odds with its own feminist theme . " Robert Bianco from the '' Pittsburgh Post-Gazette '' derided Allen 's musical production numbers , comparing them to the disastrous opening number at the 61st ceremony held in 1989 .

" He also wrote that , " The song medley is getting old hat , " and the " smug references to his flop '' Mr. Saturday Night '' were out of an improv amateur night . " The telecast also received unfavorable reaction from various public feminist figures . In an interview with '' Los Angeles Daily News '' author and activist Betty Friedan condemned the " Year of the Woman " theme commenting , " It had no basis in reality . On behalf of women directors , cinematographer , and producers , I resent the travesty of calling that a tribute . " Likewise , President of the National Organization for Women 's Los Angeles chapter Tammy Bruce chastised ceremony 's feminist tribute as " one of the most hypocritical , patronizing things I saw in my whole life . " In response , Gil Cates responded towards the criticism of the theme stating , " The theme developed and raised consciousness in a way that I think is positive , not only for the individual in general but for individual women specifically . " He also quoted an ancient Chinese proverb later made famous by former U.S. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt saying , " It is better to light one candle than to curse the darkness " Despite the adverse reception , the ABC broadcast drew in an average of 45.7 million people over its length , which was a 3 % increase from the previous year 's ceremony . The show also drew higher Nielsen ratings compared to the previous ceremony with 31.2 % of households watching over a 51 share . It also drew a higher 18 – 49 demo rating with a 20.1 rating among viewers in that demographic

                CONTEXT='' The Zookeeper '' is an independent 2001 drama film directed by Ralph Ziman and starring Sam Neill , Gina McKee , and Ulrich Thomsen . It was screened at the 2001 Toronto International Film Festival and the 2001 Fort Lauderdale International Film Festival . In an unspecified Eastern European country , soldiers round up the inhabitants of a village . Ten year old Zioig ( Javor Loznica ) is separated from his mother Ankica ( Gina McKee ) . While being transported in a truck , Ziog 's father ( Mikulás Kren ) tells his son that he is a man now and that grown men do n't cry . The soldiers kill the men but Zioig manages to escape . Meanwhile in the capital city , a former Interior Ministry official and Communist party member named Ludovic ( Sam Neill ) works at a zoo . He receives a letter from his estranged daughter Anna in Paris who wants to reconcile with her father . With the city under siege , Ludovic volunteers to help the Indian veterinary ( Om Puri ) to look after the animals until they can safely evacuate them . Due to scarce supplies , they are forced to put the animals on rations . Elsewhere , the orphaned Zioig is picked up by a truck carrying United Nations peacekeepers . During the journey , he jumps out of the truck while the peacekeepers are asleep and steals two boxes of supplies . Back in the capital city , Ludovic encounters the militia leader Dragov ( Ulrich Thomsen ) at a checkpoint . Despite lacking identity papers , Dragov lets him through because they are of the same race . Ludovic moves into the zoo and helps the veterinary to look after the animals . Ludovic develops an attachment to a female gibbon named " Luisa . " While visiting the wolves ' pen , Ludovic encounters the orphaned Zioig and tells the boy to leave . Amidst the fighting , Ludovic befriends the Vet while drinking . The Vet tells Ludovic that good men do the right thing in bad times . The following morning , Dragov and his militia visit the zoo and arrests the Vet because he is of a different race . When Ludovic protests , Dragov replies that they will let him go if he is innocent . Ludovic is forced to look after the animals alone . The following morning , Ludovic buries a dead man he finds strung up outside . Later , Zioig returns and forces his way into Ludovic 's cabin with a gun . When the boy faints , Ludovic takes pity on him and tends to the boy 's leg wound with antibiotics . After feeding Zioig , Ludovic tells him that he has to leave the next day because his presence would endanger him . Zioig complies but later returns with a woman , who identifies herself as Zioig ’s mother Ankica . Taking pity on them , Ludovic decides to allow Zioig and his mother to stay . After a blood-stained Zioig returns with cigarettes taken from a man he purportedly found dead , Ankica confides in Ludovic that she is losing touch with her son . While at the zoo ’s butchery , Ankica recounts her experiences in a prison camp where she was raped by a guard who used to be her neighbor . Ankica also begs Ludovic to be kind to her son in order to help him . While Ludovic spends time with Zioig , Ankica reads through Ludovic 's diaries . When Dragov and his militia return to seize the farm animals for food , Ludovic hides Ankica inside a barn . While Dragov and one of his men Slavko ( Srdjan Simeonovich ) search the barn , Ludovic distracts them by giving them a lion cub as a mascot . After the militiamen leave , Ankica kisses Ludovic out of gratitude . Ludovic comforts the distraught Zioig , who is troubled by the suffering zoo animals . When Ludovic discovers that Ankica has been reading through his diaries , he angrily orders them to leave . Zioig storms out in a fit of rage . Ludovic and Ankica eventually discover that her son has gunned down the militiaman Slavko . Ankica searches for her son but he avoids her . Returning to the cabin , Ankica and Ludovic reconcile and develop feelings for each other . The following morning , Ludovic feeds the body of the militiaman to a lion . That night , the zoo 's monkey house is hit by artillery . Ludovic tries to rescue the monkeys but they succumb to the flames , smoke , and trauma . After some argument , Ankica convinces Ludovic to leave the zoo with her and her son . Later , Ludovic and Ankica comfort Zioig as he mourns over a wolf killed during the bombardment . Mother and son reconcile while Ludovic imparts fatherly advice to Zioig that grown men do cry . The following morning , Ludovic farewells the animals and prepares to leave the zoo with Zioig and Ankica . However , Ankica is killed by one of Dragov ’s snipers . Ludovic tends to her while Dragov and his militia drive away from the city . As UN peacekeepers enter the city and evacuate the animals , Ludovic and Zioig bury Ankica .

                CONTEXT=The Immaculate Reception is one of the most famous plays in the history of American football . It occurred in the AFC divisional playoff game of the National Football League ( NFL ) , between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Oakland Raiders at Three Rivers Stadium in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , on December 23 , 1972 . With the Steelers trailing in the last 30 seconds of the game , Pittsburgh quarterback Terry Bradshaw threw a pass attempt to John Fuqua . The ball either bounced off the helmet of Raiders safety Jack Tatum or off the hands of Fuqua , and , as it fell , Steelers fullback Franco Harris scooped it up and ran for a game - winning touchdown . The play has been a source of unresolved controversy and speculation ever since , as many people have contended that the ball only touched Fuqua or that it hit the ground before Harris caught it , either of which would have resulted in an incomplete pass by the rules at the time . Kevin Cook 's The Last Headbangers cites the play as the beginning of a bitter rivalry between Pittsburgh and Oakland that fueled a historically brutal Raiders team during the NFL 's most controversially physical era .

                CONTEXT=The development of states — large - scale , populous , politically centralized , and socially stratified polities / societies governed by powerful rulers — marks one of the major milestones in the evolution of human societies . Archaeologists often distinguish between primary ( or pristine ) states and secondary states . Primary states evolved independently through largely internal developmental processes rather than through the influence of any other pre-existing state . The earliest known primary states appeared in Mesopotamia c. 3700 BC , in Egypt c. 3300 BC , in the Indus Valley c. 2500 BC , India c. 1700 BC , and in China c. 1600 BC . As they interacted with their less developed neighbors through trade , warfare , migration , and more generalized ideological influences , the primary states directly or indirectly fostered the emergence of secondary states in surrounding areas , for example , the Hittites in Anatolia , the Minoan and Mycenaean states of the Aegean , or the Nubian kingdoms in the Sudan . According to Professor Gil Stein of the University of Chicago Oriental Institute , " The excavations and archaeological surveys of the last few decades have vastly increased both the quantity and quality of what we know about ancient states and urbanism . Archaeologists have broadened the scope of their research beyond the traditional focus on rulers and urban elites . Current research now aims at understanding the role of urban commoners , craft specialists , and village - based farmers in the overall organization of ancient states and societies . Given the immense geographical scope encompassed by the term ' the Ancient World ' " . The notion of a sovereign state arises in the 16th century with the development of modern diplomacy . For earlier times , the term " sovereign state " is an anachronism . What corresponded to sovereign states in the medieval and ancient period were monarchs ruling by the grace of God , de facto feudal or imperial autocrats , or de facto independent nations or tribal confederations .

                CONTEXT=The Travelers Aid Society of New York ( TAS - NY ) was founded by Grace Hoadley Dodge in New York City in 1907 . Thirteen other prominent Christian and Jewish women , including the social worker Belle Moskowitz , made up the Society 's first Board of Directors . The Travelers Aid Society 's purpose was to provide social work to women traveling alone in order to protect them from moral danger . The TAS - NY believed that the greatest threat to female travelers in the early twentieth century was white slave trafficking , defined as the coercion of " white " women into prostitution and their subsequent sale to procurers or male clients . Agents of the Travelers Aid Society patrolled Grand Central Terminal and Pennsylvania Station , as well as the city 's piers where transatlantic ocean liners docked , looking for women who they identified as vulnerable . Services usually entailed safely escorting women , immigrant and native - born alike , to city addresses , other transportation lines , or to a temporary lodging home , such as the YWCA . The TAS - NY 's first headquarters was a four - story row house located a short walk from Grand Central Terminal at 238 East 48th St in the Turtle Bay neighborhood .

The Royal Italian Army , although outnumbering the German soldiers three to one , was leaderless , poorly equipped , and in chaos . After a failed resistance at the Pyramid of Cestius by remaining loyalist soldiers , carabinieri ( including a school of cadets ) , and civilians , the Germans occupied Rome . They announced the imposition of German military law with summary execution for violators . Three days later ( on 12 September ) , Nazi commandos tracked down and rescued Mussolini from his hidden prison in the Gran Sasso and set him up in the puppet regime of the so-called " Republic of Salò " in Northern Italy . In October they rounded up and deported the Jews of Rome for extermination at Auschwitz and also made numerous mass roundups of non-Jewish male civilians for forced labor . Meanwhile , General Mark Clark 's Fifth Army in Salerno suffered severe setbacks , and General Eisenhower and other Allied leaders began concentrating their attention on the imminent invasion of France , temporarily neglecting Italy

                CONTEXT=Nambassa significantly expanded the concept of multiple open air staging , all running simultaneously at the one event . Out of the first 1978 three-day festival , the requirement of a second stage grew from the need to expand the entertainment program because of the resounding feedback from local performers and artists wanting to play at Nambassa . This became the " Aerial Railway " , a second fully operational stage with sound , lighting and management . Aerial Railway absorbed the overflow of performers from the Main Stage , and also acted as a venue for spontaneous performances or raves . This second option was integral to the Nambassa philosophy of promoting local music and arts . Although the Miami Pop Festival in December 1968 featured two simultaneous ' main ' stages , most of the early U.S. and European rock festivals , including Woodstock festival , Monterey Pop Festival and Isle of Wight Festival were predominantly single stage productions . The Nambassa 1978 festival had three stages ; 1979 saw this expanded to four ( including workshop stages ) , and the 1981 5-day celebration heralded five separate sound and lighting venues , all running at the same time . In 1981 , " Aerial Railway " was replaced with the " Open Air Theatre " and " Woozlebub " for children . The multiple staging concepts seem to be finally making a comeback in the 21st century as seen at the recent Big Day Out and Glastonbury festivals

                CONTEXT=The '' All Eyes on Sharon Tate '' documentary was used to publicize the film . Its 14 minutes consisted of a number of scenes depicting Tate filming '' Eye of the Devil '' , dancing in nightclubs , and sightseeing around London , and also contained a brief interview with her . Asked about her acting ambitions , she replied , " I do n't fool myself . I ca n't see myself doing Shakespeare . " She spoke of her hopes of finding a niche in comedy , and in other interviews she expressed her desire to become " a light comedienne in the Carole Lombard style " . She discussed the type of contemporary actress she wanted to emulate and explained that there were two in particular that she was influenced by : Faye Dunaway and Catherine Deneuve . Of the latter , she said , " I 'd like to be an American Catherine Deneuve . She plays beautiful , sensitive , deep parts with a little bit of intelligence behind them . " Later in the year , '' Valley of the Dolls '' opened to almost uniformly negative reviews . Bosley Crowther wrote in '' The New York Times '' , " all a fairly respectful admirer of movies can do is laugh at it and turn away " . '' Newsweek '' said that the film " has no more sense of its own ludicrousness than a village idiot stumbling in manure " , but a later article read : " Astoundingly photogenic , infinitely curvaceous , Sharon Tate is one of the most smashing young things to hit Hollywood in a long time . " The three lead actresses were castigated in numerous publications , including '' The Saturday Review '' , which wrote , " Ten years ago ... Parkins , Duke , and Tate would more likely have been playing the hat check girls than movie-queens ; they are totally lacking in style , authority , or charm . " '' The Hollywood Reporter '' provided some positive comments , such as , " Sharon Tate emerges as the film 's most sympathetic character ... William H. Daniels ' photographic caress of her faultless face and enormous absorbent eyes is stunning . " Roger Ebert of the '' Chicago Sun-Times '' praised Tate as " a wonder to behold " , but after describing the dialogue in one scene as " the most offensive and appalling vulgarity ever thrown up by any civilization " , concluded that , " I will be unable to take her any more seriously as a sex symbol than Raquel Welch . " In late 1967 , Tate and Polanski returned to London and were frequent subjects of newspaper and magazine articles . Tate was depicted as being untraditional and modern , and was quoted as saying couples should live together before marrying . They were married in Chelsea , London , on January 20 , 1968 , with considerable publicity . Polanski was dressed in what the press described as " Edwardian finery " , while Tate was attired in a white minidress . The couple moved into Polanski 's mews house off Eaton Square in Belgravia , London . Photographer Peter Evans later described them as " the imperfect couple . They were the Douglas Fairbanks/Mary Pickford of our time ... Cool , nomadic , talented , and nicely shocking . " While Tate reportedly wanted a traditional marriage , Polanski remained somewhat promiscuous and described Tate 's attitude to his infidelity as " Sharon 's big hang-up " . He reminded Tate that she had promised that she would not try to change him . Tate accepted Polanski 's conditions , though she confided to friends that she hoped he would change . Peter Evans quoted Tate as saying , " We have a good arrangement . Roman lies to me and I pretend to believe him . " Polanski urged Tate to end her association with Martin Ransohoff , and Tate began to place less importance on her career until Polanski told her he wanted to be married to " a hippie , not a housewife . " The couple returned to Los Angeles and quickly became part of a social group that included some of the most successful young people in the film industry , including Warren Beatty , Jacqueline Bisset , Leslie Caron , Joan Collins , Mia Farrow , Jane Fonda , Peter Fonda , Laurence Harvey , Steve McQueen , Joanna Pettet and Peter Sellers ; older film stars like Yul Brynner , Kirk Douglas , Henry Fonda and Danny Kaye ; musicians such as Jim Morrison and The Mamas & the Papas ; and record producer Terry Melcher and his girlfriend , actress Candice Bergen . Jay Sebring remained one of the couple 's more frequent companions . Polanski 's circle of friends included people he had known since his youth in Poland such as Wojciech Frykowski and Frykowski 's girlfriend , coffee heiress Abigail Folger . Tate and Polanski moved into the Chateau Marmont Hotel in Los Angeles for a few months until they arranged to lease Patty Duke 's home on Summit Ridge Drive in Beverly Hills during the latter part of 1968 . The Polanski house was often full of strangers , and Tate regarded the casual atmosphere as part of the " free spirit " of the times , saying that she did not mind who came into her home as her motto was " live and let live . " Her close friend Leslie Caron later commented that the Polanskis were too trusting — " to the point of recklessness " — and that she had been alarmed by it

Also commenting on Lamar , '' Billboard '' 's Chris Payne wrote , " There are n't many A-list rappers who could handle a beat like this , but Kendrick is clearly one of them . " '' Rolling Stone '' editor Jon Dolan gave the song three-and-a-half out of five stars , commenting " Over offhandedly lovely , warp-speed psychedelic soul-jazz , Lamar unleashes a word-mad waterfall with a worried emotional core ( " analyze my demise I say I 'm super-anxious " , he raps ) . " '' Consequence of Sound '' editor Nina Corcoran wrote : " when combined with one of Lamar ’s hottest verses to date ( before '' To Pimp a Butterfly '' ) , the song explodes . But it does n’t stop there . FlyLo shows off his talent by shifting gears post-Kendrick verse the only way you can : insane keys , double-time bass drum , and unrelenting hand claps . Eventually , it ’s all swallowed up in massive swelling synth and choral hums , fading to a beautiful , passionate outro . " Directed by Hiro Murai , the video begins at a funeral ( including attendees Flying Lotus and Thundercat in cameo roles ) . Seemingly a sad video , it turns instantly joyful when the two late children - a boy and a girl - bound out of their caskets at the front of the church and dance gleefully down the aisle . The mourners ca n't see the children as they dance right out of the church and out onto a blacktop , but a group of other kids chases after them as they hop in a hearse and drive away . The clip was featured by several publications on their year-end list of best videos , including '' Pitchfork '' , '' Spin '' , and Stereogumwith the latter listing it at number one . The video received two nominations at the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards : Best Choreography and Best Cinematography , ultimately winning the latter

                CONTEXT=Living Stage Theatre Company was a theatre for social change founded in 1966 by Robert A. Alexander ( 1929 – 2008 ) . He served as the artistic director until 1995 . Located in Washington , D.C. , this professional improvisational theater offered participatory workshops to children , youth , teachers , parents , and community members . Living Stage ’s main philosophy was based in the belief that every one is born an artist and the act of creation is the ultimate act of self - affirmation . The company 's mission was to transform individuals and communities through creative empowerment . The projects that the Living Stage put on typically dealt with controversial and sensitive topics like race , economic inequality , the dangers of an overzealous American foreign policy , the atom bomb , violence , and freedom . The " Baltimore Incident " of 1971 is an excellent example of how controversial these productions could be . No matter how mixed opinions were , the Living Stage always elicited a reaction with their improvisational performances . During the 1980s the Living Stage began to reach out extensively to local initiatives like The District 's Alcohol and Drug Abuse Services Administration and created their own Community Services Project in order to continue to bring theater and creativity to underserved sections of society . The Living Stage championed New Left ideals like equality and social justice throughout the Reagan years , despite some criticisms about their message being " anachronistic " . The Living Stage dissolved after 36 years and was a venture of Arena Stage .

Its 14 minutes consisted of a number of scenes depicting Tate filming '' Eye of the Devil '' , dancing in nightclubs , and sightseeing around London , and also contained a brief interview with her . Asked about her acting ambitions , she replied , " I do n't fool myself . I ca n't see myself doing Shakespeare . " She spoke of her hopes of finding a niche in comedy , and in other interviews she expressed her desire to become " a light comedienne in the Carole Lombard style " . She discussed the type of contemporary actress she wanted to emulate and explained that there were two in particular that she was influenced by : Faye Dunaway and Catherine Deneuve . Of the latter , she said , " I 'd like to be an American Catherine Deneuve . She plays beautiful , sensitive , deep parts with a little bit of intelligence behind them . " Later in the year , '' Valley of the Dolls '' opened to almost uniformly negative reviews . Bosley Crowther wrote in '' The New York Times '' , " all a fairly respectful admirer of movies can do is laugh at it and turn away " . '' Newsweek '' said that the film " has no more sense of its own ludicrousness than a village idiot stumbling in manure " , but a later article read : " Astoundingly photogenic , infinitely curvaceous , Sharon Tate is one of the most smashing young things to hit Hollywood in a long time . " The three lead actresses were castigated in numerous publications , including '' The Saturday Review '' , which wrote , " Ten years ago ... Parkins , Duke , and Tate would more likely have been playing the hat check girls than movie-queens ; they are totally lacking in style , authority , or charm . " '' The Hollywood Reporter '' provided some positive comments , such as , " Sharon Tate emerges as the film 's most sympathetic character ... William H. Daniels ' photographic caress of her faultless face and enormous absorbent eyes is stunning . " Roger Ebert of the '' Chicago Sun-Times '' praised Tate as " a wonder to behold " , but after describing the dialogue in one scene as " the most offensive and appalling vulgarity ever thrown up by any civilization " , concluded that , " I will be unable to take her any more seriously as a sex symbol than Raquel Welch . " In late 1967 , Tate and Polanski returned to London and were frequent subjects of newspaper and magazine articles . Tate was depicted as being untraditional and modern , and was quoted as saying couples should live together before marrying . They were married in Chelsea , London , on January 20 , 1968 , with considerable publicity . Polanski was dressed in what the press described as " Edwardian finery " , while Tate was attired in a white minidress . The couple moved into Polanski 's mews house off Eaton Square in Belgravia , London . Photographer Peter Evans later described them as " the imperfect couple . They were the Douglas Fairbanks/Mary Pickford of our time ... Cool , nomadic , talented , and nicely shocking . " While Tate reportedly wanted a traditional marriage , Polanski remained somewhat promiscuous and described Tate 's attitude to his infidelity as " Sharon 's big hang-up " . He reminded Tate that she had promised that she would not try to change him . Tate accepted Polanski 's conditions , though she confided to friends that she hoped he would change . Peter Evans quoted Tate as saying , " We have a good arrangement . Roman lies to me and I pretend to believe him . " Polanski urged Tate to end her association with Martin Ransohoff , and Tate began to place less importance on her career until Polanski told her he wanted to be married to " a hippie , not a housewife . " The couple returned to Los Angeles and quickly became part of a social group that included some of the most successful young people in the film industry , including Warren Beatty , Jacqueline Bisset , Leslie Caron , Joan Collins , Mia Farrow , Jane Fonda , Peter Fonda , Laurence Harvey , Steve McQueen , Joanna Pettet and Peter Sellers ; older film stars like Yul Brynner , Kirk Douglas , Henry Fonda and Danny Kaye ; musicians such as Jim Morrison and The Mamas & the Papas ; and record producer Terry Melcher and his girlfriend , actress Candice Bergen . Jay Sebring remained one of the couple 's more frequent companions . Polanski 's circle of friends included people he had known since his youth in Poland such as Wojciech Frykowski and Frykowski 's girlfriend , coffee heiress Abigail Folger . Tate and Polanski moved into the Chateau Marmont Hotel in Los Angeles for a few months until they arranged to lease Patty Duke 's home on Summit Ridge Drive in Beverly Hills during the latter part of 1968 . The Polanski house was often full of strangers , and Tate regarded the casual atmosphere as part of the " free spirit " of the times , saying that she did not mind who came into her home as her motto was " live and let live . " Her close friend Leslie Caron later commented that the Polanskis were too trusting — " to the point of recklessness " — and that she had been alarmed by it

                CONTEXT=Living Stage Theatre Company was a theatre for social change founded in 1966 by Robert A. Alexander ( 1929 – 2008 ) . He served as the artistic director until 1995 . Located in Washington , D.C. , this professional improvisational theater offered participatory workshops to children , youth , teachers , parents , and community members . Living Stage ’s main philosophy was based in the belief that every one is born an artist and the act of creation is the ultimate act of self - affirmation . The company 's mission was to transform individuals and communities through creative empowerment . The projects that the Living Stage put on typically dealt with controversial and sensitive topics like race , economic inequality , the dangers of an overzealous American foreign policy , the atom bomb , violence , and freedom . The " Baltimore Incident " of 1971 is an excellent example of how controversial these productions could be . No matter how mixed opinions were , the Living Stage always elicited a reaction with their improvisational performances . During the 1980s the Living Stage began to reach out extensively to local initiatives like The District 's Alcohol and Drug Abuse Services Administration and created their own Community Services Project in order to continue to bring theater and creativity to underserved sections of society . The Living Stage championed New Left ideals like equality and social justice throughout the Reagan years , despite some criticisms about their message being " anachronistic " . The Living Stage dissolved after 36 years and was a venture of Arena Stage .

It occurred in the AFC divisional playoff game of the National Football League ( NFL ) , between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Oakland Raiders at Three Rivers Stadium in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , on December 23 , 1972 . With the Steelers trailing in the last 30 seconds of the game , Pittsburgh quarterback Terry Bradshaw threw a pass attempt to John Fuqua . The ball either bounced off the helmet of Raiders safety Jack Tatum or off the hands of Fuqua , and , as it fell , Steelers fullback Franco Harris scooped it up and ran for a game - winning touchdown . The play has been a source of unresolved controversy and speculation ever since , as many people have contended that the ball only touched Fuqua or that it hit the ground before Harris caught it , either of which would have resulted in an incomplete pass by the rules at the time . Kevin Cook 's The Last Headbangers cites the play as the beginning of a bitter rivalry between Pittsburgh and Oakland that fueled a historically brutal Raiders team during the NFL 's most controversially physical era .

                CONTEXT=The '' All Eyes on Sharon Tate '' documentary was used to publicize the film . Its 14 minutes consisted of a number of scenes depicting Tate filming '' Eye of the Devil '' , dancing in nightclubs , and sightseeing around London , and also contained a brief interview with her . Asked about her acting ambitions , she replied , " I do n't fool myself . I ca n't see myself doing Shakespeare . " She spoke of her hopes of finding a niche in comedy , and in other interviews she expressed her desire to become " a light comedienne in the Carole Lombard style " . She discussed the type of contemporary actress she wanted to emulate and explained that there were two in particular that she was influenced by : Faye Dunaway and Catherine Deneuve . Of the latter , she said , " I 'd like to be an American Catherine Deneuve . She plays beautiful , sensitive , deep parts with a little bit of intelligence behind them . " Later in the year , '' Valley of the Dolls '' opened to almost uniformly negative reviews . Bosley Crowther wrote in '' The New York Times '' , " all a fairly respectful admirer of movies can do is laugh at it and turn away " . '' Newsweek '' said that the film " has no more sense of its own ludicrousness than a village idiot stumbling in manure " , but a later article read : " Astoundingly photogenic , infinitely curvaceous , Sharon Tate is one of the most smashing young things to hit Hollywood in a long time . " The three lead actresses were castigated in numerous publications , including '' The Saturday Review '' , which wrote , " Ten years ago ... Parkins , Duke , and Tate would more likely have been playing the hat check girls than movie-queens ; they are totally lacking in style , authority , or charm . " '' The Hollywood Reporter '' provided some positive comments , such as , " Sharon Tate emerges as the film 's most sympathetic character ... William H. Daniels ' photographic caress of her faultless face and enormous absorbent eyes is stunning . " Roger Ebert of the '' Chicago Sun-Times '' praised Tate as " a wonder to behold " , but after describing the dialogue in one scene as " the most offensive and appalling vulgarity ever thrown up by any civilization " , concluded that , " I will be unable to take her any more seriously as a sex symbol than Raquel Welch . " In late 1967 , Tate and Polanski returned to London and were frequent subjects of newspaper and magazine articles . Tate was depicted as being untraditional and modern , and was quoted as saying couples should live together before marrying . They were married in Chelsea , London , on January 20 , 1968 , with considerable publicity . Polanski was dressed in what the press described as " Edwardian finery " , while Tate was attired in a white minidress . The couple moved into Polanski 's mews house off Eaton Square in Belgravia , London . Photographer Peter Evans later described them as " the imperfect couple . They were the Douglas Fairbanks/Mary Pickford of our time ... Cool , nomadic , talented , and nicely shocking . " While Tate reportedly wanted a traditional marriage , Polanski remained somewhat promiscuous and described Tate 's attitude to his infidelity as " Sharon 's big hang-up " . He reminded Tate that she had promised that she would not try to change him . Tate accepted Polanski 's conditions , though she confided to friends that she hoped he would change . Peter Evans quoted Tate as saying , " We have a good arrangement . Roman lies to me and I pretend to believe him . " Polanski urged Tate to end her association with Martin Ransohoff , and Tate began to place less importance on her career until Polanski told her he wanted to be married to " a hippie , not a housewife . " The couple returned to Los Angeles and quickly became part of a social group that included some of the most successful young people in the film industry , including Warren Beatty , Jacqueline Bisset , Leslie Caron , Joan Collins , Mia Farrow , Jane Fonda , Peter Fonda , Laurence Harvey , Steve McQueen , Joanna Pettet and Peter Sellers ; older film stars like Yul Brynner , Kirk Douglas , Henry Fonda and Danny Kaye ; musicians such as Jim Morrison and The Mamas & the Papas ; and record producer Terry Melcher and his girlfriend , actress Candice Bergen . Jay Sebring remained one of the couple 's more frequent companions . Polanski 's circle of friends included people he had known since his youth in Poland such as Wojciech Frykowski and Frykowski 's girlfriend , coffee heiress Abigail Folger . Tate and Polanski moved into the Chateau Marmont Hotel in Los Angeles for a few months until they arranged to lease Patty Duke 's home on Summit Ridge Drive in Beverly Hills during the latter part of 1968 . The Polanski house was often full of strangers , and Tate regarded the casual atmosphere as part of the " free spirit " of the times , saying that she did not mind who came into her home as her motto was " live and let live . " Her close friend Leslie Caron later commented that the Polanskis were too trusting — " to the point of recklessness " — and that she had been alarmed by it

After attending a Queen concert in Los Angeles , Michael Jackson suggested to Mercury backstage that " Another One Bites the Dust " be released as a single , and in October 1980 it spent three weeks at number one . The album topped the '' Billboard '' 200 for five weeks , and sold over four million copies in the US . It was also the first appearance of a synthesiser on a Queen album . Heretofore , their albums featured a distinctive " No Synthesisers ! " sleeve note . The note is widely assumed to reflect an anti-synth , pro- " hard " - rock stance by the band , but was later revealed by producer Roy Thomas Baker to be an attempt to clarify that those albums ' multi-layered solos were created with guitars , not synths , as record company executives kept assuming at the time . In September 1980 , Queen performed three sold-out shows at Madison Square Garden . In 1980 , Queen also released the soundtrack they had recorded for '' Flash Gordon '' . At the 1981 American Music Awards in January , " Another One Bites the Dust " won the award for Favorite Pop/Rock Single , and Queen were nominated for Favorite Pop/Rock Band , Duo , or Group

                CONTEXT=Living Stage Theatre Company was a theatre for social change founded in 1966 by Robert A. Alexander ( 1929 – 2008 ) . He served as the artistic director until 1995 . Located in Washington , D.C. , this professional improvisational theater offered participatory workshops to children , youth , teachers , parents , and community members . Living Stage ’s main philosophy was based in the belief that every one is born an artist and the act of creation is the ultimate act of self - affirmation . The company 's mission was to transform individuals and communities through creative empowerment . The projects that the Living Stage put on typically dealt with controversial and sensitive topics like race , economic inequality , the dangers of an overzealous American foreign policy , the atom bomb , violence , and freedom . The " Baltimore Incident " of 1971 is an excellent example of how controversial these productions could be . No matter how mixed opinions were , the Living Stage always elicited a reaction with their improvisational performances . During the 1980s the Living Stage began to reach out extensively to local initiatives like The District 's Alcohol and Drug Abuse Services Administration and created their own Community Services Project in order to continue to bring theater and creativity to underserved sections of society . The Living Stage championed New Left ideals like equality and social justice throughout the Reagan years , despite some criticisms about their message being " anachronistic " . The Living Stage dissolved after 36 years and was a venture of Arena Stage .

He also questioned the purpose of the " Year of the Woman " theme writing , " The Oscar show itself seemed at odds with its own feminist theme . " Robert Bianco from the '' Pittsburgh Post-Gazette '' derided Allen 's musical production numbers , comparing them to the disastrous opening number at the 61st ceremony held in 1989 . Columnist Matt Roush of '' USA Today '' complained , " Crystal , in a by-now-familiar performance , has , in four years , taken a plum assignment and , by repetition , reduced it to shtick . " He also wrote that , " The song medley is getting old hat , " and the " smug references to his flop '' Mr. Saturday Night '' were out of an improv amateur night . " The telecast also received unfavorable reaction from various public feminist figures . In an interview with '' Los Angeles Daily News '' author and activist Betty Friedan condemned the " Year of the Woman " theme commenting , " It had no basis in reality . On behalf of women directors , cinematographer , and producers , I resent the travesty of calling that a tribute .

                CONTEXT=Crop Over is a traditional harvest festival which began in Barbados , having had its early beginnings on the sugar cane plantations during slavery . The original crop - over tradition began in 1687 as a way to mark the end of the yearly harvest , but was wide - spread throughout the region at the time , including in St. Vincent , Trinidad and Jamaica . As such , it still shares similarities with Carnival in Brazil and Trinidad . Many crop - over celebrations were organized and sponsored by planters , who used gifts of food and liquor as a means of reenforcing and excusing the continued enslavement of their labour force . However , slaves would also have often unsanctioned fetes that featured singing , dancing and accompaniment by bottles filled with water , shak - shak , banjo , triangle , fiddle , guitar , and bones that were more in keeping with their ancestral culture . Other traditions that were later added included climbing a greased pole , feasting and drinking competitions . However , with the harsh effects of World War II on Barbados , these annual celebrations came to an end . The Crop Over Festival was first launched on June 1 , 1970 , but was not officially called a festival until 4 years later .

                CONTEXT=Crop Over is a traditional harvest festival which began in Barbados , having had its early beginnings on the sugar cane plantations during slavery . The original crop - over tradition began in 1687 as a way to mark the end of the yearly harvest , but was wide - spread throughout the region at the time , including in St. Vincent , Trinidad and Jamaica . As such , it still shares similarities with Carnival in Brazil and Trinidad . Many crop - over celebrations were organized and sponsored by planters , who used gifts of food and liquor as a means of reenforcing and excusing the continued enslavement of their labour force . However , slaves would also have often unsanctioned fetes that featured singing , dancing and accompaniment by bottles filled with water , shak - shak , banjo , triangle , fiddle , guitar , and bones that were more in keeping with their ancestral culture . Other traditions that were later added included climbing a greased pole , feasting and drinking competitions . However , with the harsh effects of World War II on Barbados , these annual celebrations came to an end . The Crop Over Festival was first launched on June 1 , 1970 , but was not officially called a festival until 4 years later .

                CONTEXT=Crop Over is a traditional harvest festival which began in Barbados , having had its early beginnings on the sugar cane plantations during slavery . The original crop - over tradition began in 1687 as a way to mark the end of the yearly harvest , but was wide - spread throughout the region at the time , including in St. Vincent , Trinidad and Jamaica . As such , it still shares similarities with Carnival in Brazil and Trinidad . Many crop - over celebrations were organized and sponsored by planters , who used gifts of food and liquor as a means of reenforcing and excusing the continued enslavement of their labour force . However , slaves would also have often unsanctioned fetes that featured singing , dancing and accompaniment by bottles filled with water , shak - shak , banjo , triangle , fiddle , guitar , and bones that were more in keeping with their ancestral culture . Other traditions that were later added included climbing a greased pole , feasting and drinking competitions . However , with the harsh effects of World War II on Barbados , these annual celebrations came to an end . The Crop Over Festival was first launched on June 1 , 1970 , but was not officially called a festival until 4 years later .

                CONTEXT=Some of the most unfavorable reviews came from major American newspapers . A. O. Scott of '' The New York Times '' describes '' 300 '' as " about as violent as '' Apocalypto '' and twice as stupid , " while criticizing its color scheme and suggesting that its plot includes racist undertones ; Scott also poked fun at the buffed bodies of the actors portraying the Spartans , declaring that the Persian characters are " pioneers in the art of face-piercing " , but that the Spartans had access to " superior health clubs and electrolysis facilities " . Kenneth Turan writes in the '' Los Angeles Times '' that " unless you love violence as much as a Spartan , Quentin Tarantino or a video-game-playing teenage boy , you will not be endlessly fascinated . " Roger Ebert , in his review , gave the film a two-star rating , writing , " '' 300 '' has one-dimensional caricatures who talk like professional wrestlers plugging their next feud . " Some critics employed at Greek newspapers have been particularly critical , such as film critic Robby Eksiel , who said that moviegoers would be dazzled by the " digital action " but irritated by the " pompous interpretations and one-dimensional characters . " '' Variety '' Todd McCarthy describes the film as " visually arresting " although " bombastic " while Kirk Honeycutt , writing in '' The Hollywood Reporter '' , praises the " beauty of its topography , colors and forms . " Writing in the '' Chicago Sun Times '' , Richard Roeper acclaims '' 300 '' as " the '' Citizen Kane '' of cinematic graphic novels . " '' Empire '' gave the film 3 out of 5 having a verdict of " Visually stunning , thoroughly belligerent and as shallow as a pygmy 's paddling pool , this is a whole heap of style tinged with just a smidgen of substance . " '' 300 '' was also warmly received by websites focusing on comics and video games . Comic Book Resources ' Mark Cronan found the film compelling , leaving him " with a feeling of power , from having been witness to something grand . " IGN 's Todd Gilchrist acclaimed Zack Snyder as a cinematic visionary and " a possible redeemer of modern moviemaking . " At the MTV Movie Awards 2007 , '' 300 '' was nominated for Best Movie , Best Performance for Gerard Butler , Best Breakthrough Performance for Lena Headey , Best Villain for Rodrigo Santoro , and Best Fight for Leonidas battling " the Über Immortal " , but only won the award for Best Fight .

                CONTEXT=The show received a negative reception from most media publications . Associated Press television critic Frazier Moore lamented that Crystal " seemed incredibly listless " . He also questioned the purpose of the " Year of the Woman " theme writing , " The Oscar show itself seemed at odds with its own feminist theme . " Robert Bianco from the '' Pittsburgh Post-Gazette '' derided Allen 's musical production numbers , comparing them to the disastrous opening number at the 61st ceremony held in 1989 . Columnist Matt Roush of '' USA Today '' complained , " Crystal , in a by-now-familiar performance , has , in four years , taken a plum assignment and , by repetition , reduced it to shtick . " He also wrote that , " The song medley is getting old hat , " and the " smug references to his flop '' Mr. Saturday Night '' were out of an improv amateur night . " The telecast also received unfavorable reaction from various public feminist figures . In an interview with '' Los Angeles Daily News '' author and activist Betty Friedan condemned the " Year of the Woman " theme commenting , " It had no basis in reality . On behalf of women directors , cinematographer , and producers , I resent the travesty of calling that a tribute . " Likewise , President of the National Organization for Women 's Los Angeles chapter Tammy Bruce chastised ceremony 's feminist tribute as " one of the most hypocritical , patronizing things I saw in my whole life . " In response , Gil Cates responded towards the criticism of the theme stating , " The theme developed and raised consciousness in a way that I think is positive , not only for the individual in general but for individual women specifically . " He also quoted an ancient Chinese proverb later made famous by former U.S. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt saying , " It is better to light one candle than to curse the darkness " Despite the adverse reception , the ABC broadcast drew in an average of 45.7 million people over its length , which was a 3 % increase from the previous year 's ceremony . The show also drew higher Nielsen ratings compared to the previous ceremony with 31.2 % of households watching over a 51 share . It also drew a higher 18 – 49 demo rating with a 20.1 rating among viewers in that demographic

                CONTEXT=The '' All Eyes on Sharon Tate '' documentary was used to publicize the film . Its 14 minutes consisted of a number of scenes depicting Tate filming '' Eye of the Devil '' , dancing in nightclubs , and sightseeing around London , and also contained a brief interview with her . Asked about her acting ambitions , she replied , " I do n't fool myself . I ca n't see myself doing Shakespeare . " She spoke of her hopes of finding a niche in comedy , and in other interviews she expressed her desire to become " a light comedienne in the Carole Lombard style " . She discussed the type of contemporary actress she wanted to emulate and explained that there were two in particular that she was influenced by : Faye Dunaway and Catherine Deneuve . Of the latter , she said , " I 'd like to be an American Catherine Deneuve . She plays beautiful , sensitive , deep parts with a little bit of intelligence behind them . " Later in the year , '' Valley of the Dolls '' opened to almost uniformly negative reviews . Bosley Crowther wrote in '' The New York Times '' , " all a fairly respectful admirer of movies can do is laugh at it and turn away " . '' Newsweek '' said that the film " has no more sense of its own ludicrousness than a village idiot stumbling in manure " , but a later article read : " Astoundingly photogenic , infinitely curvaceous , Sharon Tate is one of the most smashing young things to hit Hollywood in a long time . " The three lead actresses were castigated in numerous publications , including '' The Saturday Review '' , which wrote , " Ten years ago ... Parkins , Duke , and Tate would more likely have been playing the hat check girls than movie-queens ; they are totally lacking in style , authority , or charm . " '' The Hollywood Reporter '' provided some positive comments , such as , " Sharon Tate emerges as the film 's most sympathetic character ... William H. Daniels ' photographic caress of her faultless face and enormous absorbent eyes is stunning . " Roger Ebert of the '' Chicago Sun-Times '' praised Tate as " a wonder to behold " , but after describing the dialogue in one scene as " the most offensive and appalling vulgarity ever thrown up by any civilization " , concluded that , " I will be unable to take her any more seriously as a sex symbol than Raquel Welch . " In late 1967 , Tate and Polanski returned to London and were frequent subjects of newspaper and magazine articles . Tate was depicted as being untraditional and modern , and was quoted as saying couples should live together before marrying . They were married in Chelsea , London , on January 20 , 1968 , with considerable publicity . Polanski was dressed in what the press described as " Edwardian finery " , while Tate was attired in a white minidress . The couple moved into Polanski 's mews house off Eaton Square in Belgravia , London . Photographer Peter Evans later described them as " the imperfect couple . They were the Douglas Fairbanks/Mary Pickford of our time ... Cool , nomadic , talented , and nicely shocking . " While Tate reportedly wanted a traditional marriage , Polanski remained somewhat promiscuous and described Tate 's attitude to his infidelity as " Sharon 's big hang-up " . He reminded Tate that she had promised that she would not try to change him . Tate accepted Polanski 's conditions , though she confided to friends that she hoped he would change . Peter Evans quoted Tate as saying , " We have a good arrangement . Roman lies to me and I pretend to believe him . " Polanski urged Tate to end her association with Martin Ransohoff , and Tate began to place less importance on her career until Polanski told her he wanted to be married to " a hippie , not a housewife . " The couple returned to Los Angeles and quickly became part of a social group that included some of the most successful young people in the film industry , including Warren Beatty , Jacqueline Bisset , Leslie Caron , Joan Collins , Mia Farrow , Jane Fonda , Peter Fonda , Laurence Harvey , Steve McQueen , Joanna Pettet and Peter Sellers ; older film stars like Yul Brynner , Kirk Douglas , Henry Fonda and Danny Kaye ; musicians such as Jim Morrison and The Mamas & the Papas ; and record producer Terry Melcher and his girlfriend , actress Candice Bergen . Jay Sebring remained one of the couple 's more frequent companions . Polanski 's circle of friends included people he had known since his youth in Poland such as Wojciech Frykowski and Frykowski 's girlfriend , coffee heiress Abigail Folger . Tate and Polanski moved into the Chateau Marmont Hotel in Los Angeles for a few months until they arranged to lease Patty Duke 's home on Summit Ridge Drive in Beverly Hills during the latter part of 1968 . The Polanski house was often full of strangers , and Tate regarded the casual atmosphere as part of the " free spirit " of the times , saying that she did not mind who came into her home as her motto was " live and let live . " Her close friend Leslie Caron later commented that the Polanskis were too trusting — " to the point of recklessness " — and that she had been alarmed by it

                CONTEXT=The album received mostly positive reviews from critics . David Fricke of '' Rolling Stone '' magazine gave a mostly positive review , describing '' Tragic Kingdom '' as " ear candy with good beats , not just bludgeon-by-numbers guitars " and its music as " a spry , white-suburban take on ska and Blondieesque pop " . Fricke however described " Do n't Speak " as " irritating swill " with " high-pitched rippling " from Gwen Stefani . In 2003 , the album was ranked number 441 on '' Rolling Stone '' magazine 's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time . '' Entertainment Weekly '' s David Browne attributed the album 's sales to Gwen Stefani 's " leggy , bleached-blond calling card " and concluded that " sex still sells " . Browne , however , described the music as " a hefty chunk of new-wave party bounce and Chili Peppers-style white-boy funk , with dashes of reggae , squealing hair-metal guitar , disco , ska-band horns " and the band as sounding like " savvy , lounge-bred pros " . Individual songs were singled out and commented on : " Just a Girl " was described as " a chirpy , ska-tinged bopper " , " Do n't Speak " as " an old-fangled power ballad " , " Sixteen " as a " song of solidarity with misunderstood teenage girls " , and " Spiderwebs " and " End It on This " as " Stefani acknowledg ing obsessions with losers and tr ying to break free . " Calling the album a marked improvement over " the diffuse , rambling songwriting of No Doubt 's two previous CDs " , Mike Boehm of the '' Los Angeles Times '' felt that on the album , " The band is bright , hard-hitting and kinetic , as sharp production captures the core , four-man instrumental team and adjunct horn section at their best " . In a favorable review for '' The Village Voice '' , critic Chuck Eddy felt that although " the album turns pretentious ... No Doubt resurrects the exuberance new-wave guys lost when '80s indie labels and college radio conned them into settling for slam-pit fits and wallflower wallpaper " . AllMusic called it " pure fun " and described the music as something " between '90s punk , third-wave ska , and pop sensibility " and a mix of " new wave melodicism , post-grunge rock , and West Coast sunshine " , indicating the songs " Spiderwebs " , " Just a Girl " , and " Do n't Speak " as " positively ruling the airwaves " . Yahoo! Music reviewer Bill Holdship called the album a " phenomenon " containing " hit after hit " , and describing " Spiderwebs " as " a terrific opener " . Reviewer Robert Christgau called Stefani " hebephrenic " and the album " hyped up " and not " as songful as its fun-besotted partisans claim " . At the 1997 Grammy Awards , No Doubt were nominated for Best New Artist and Best Rock Album

Kilian did however commend it for depicting the " horrors of slave life on a sea island plantation as every bit as compelling as those contained in the journal Kemble kept and later published in England during the Civil War – a book that helped turn British public opinion against recognition of the South .

                CONTEXT=Donen solidified his solo career and scored another hit with the musical '' Seven Brides for Seven Brothers '' ( 1954 ) . Based on a short story by Stephen Vincent Benét , the film 's music is by Saul Chaplin and Gene de Paul , with lyrics by Johnny Mercer and choreography by Michael Kidd . Jane Powell plays Milly , an 1850s frontierswoman who marries Adam ( Howard Keel ) only hours after meeting him . When she returns with Adam to his log cabin in the Oregon backwoods , Milly discovers that her husband 's six brothers are uncivilized and oafish . She makes it her mission to domesticate them and , upon Milly 's sarcastic suggestion , the brothers kidnap six women from a neighboring town to marry them . The film was shot in the new CinemaScope format and is remembered for its dance sequences , particularly the " barn raising scene " in which architecture and construction become acrobatic ballet steps . '' Seven Brides for Seven Brothers '' was one of the highest-grossing films of 1954 and appeared on many critics ' 10 Best Films lists . It was nominated for five Academy Awards , including Best Picture and Best Music ( Scoring of a Musical Picture ) , which it won . Its success was a surprise to MGM , which invested more money in two other musicals : '' Rose Marie '' and '' Brigadoon '' , starring Kelly . '' Seven Brides for Seven Brothers '' was more profitable than either of the other films , as well as '' On the Town '' and '' Singin ' in the Rain '' , and its success was a major turning point for Donen 's career .

                CONTEXT=Several side sketches are interwoven with the police drama . In the first , a commercial for Dead Cat Soap segues into a soap opera spoof , starring Peggy . We learn that Random is rarely home , Peggy is having an affair , and Skip 's ( " Skipper " to his mother ) sexual orientation is a scandal . In the second , Kim Coolzip presents a seductive commercial for liquid meat , which segues into her appearance on a charity fund-raising telethon . The third is the game show , in which Skip Coolzip " gives back " to Native Americans his family 's car , then his father 's squad car ( " the black screamer " ) , and finally , " everything . " He is also assigned , with his sister , to take over the Academy Awards celebration " with these stirring words : ' Eat flaming death , fascist media pigs . ' " The second side of the album , " We 've Lost Our Big Kabloona " , culminates in the hostage situation , on stage during the live broadcast of the Academy Awards . While accepting an award for a police/family drama called " Squat ! , " which stars their parents and seems identical to the show on the first side of the album , Skip and Kim Coolzip reveal a gun . They demand that the President of the United States appear in Hollywood " with a plane full of cash and all those broken treaties , " or they will shoot the nominees one by one in alphabetical order .

                CONTEXT=The show received a negative reception from most media publications . Associated Press television critic Frazier Moore lamented that Crystal " seemed incredibly listless " . He also questioned the purpose of the " Year of the Woman " theme writing , " The Oscar show itself seemed at odds with its own feminist theme . " Robert Bianco from the '' Pittsburgh Post-Gazette '' derided Allen 's musical production numbers , comparing them to the disastrous opening number at the 61st ceremony held in 1989 . Columnist Matt Roush of '' USA Today '' complained , " Crystal , in a by-now-familiar performance , has , in four years , taken a plum assignment and , by repetition , reduced it to shtick . " He also wrote that , " The song medley is getting old hat , " and the " smug references to his flop '' Mr. Saturday Night '' were out of an improv amateur night . " The telecast also received unfavorable reaction from various public feminist figures . In an interview with '' Los Angeles Daily News '' author and activist Betty Friedan condemned the " Year of the Woman " theme commenting , " It had no basis in reality . On behalf of women directors , cinematographer , and producers , I resent the travesty of calling that a tribute . " Likewise , President of the National Organization for Women 's Los Angeles chapter Tammy Bruce chastised ceremony 's feminist tribute as " one of the most hypocritical , patronizing things I saw in my whole life . " In response , Gil Cates responded towards the criticism of the theme stating , " The theme developed and raised consciousness in a way that I think is positive , not only for the individual in general but for individual women specifically . " He also quoted an ancient Chinese proverb later made famous by former U.S. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt saying , " It is better to light one candle than to curse the darkness " Despite the adverse reception , the ABC broadcast drew in an average of 45.7 million people over its length , which was a 3 % increase from the previous year 's ceremony . The show also drew higher Nielsen ratings compared to the previous ceremony with 31.2 % of households watching over a 51 share . It also drew a higher 18 – 49 demo rating with a 20.1 rating among viewers in that demographic

By February 23 , 2018 , the track " This Is Me " was nominated for Best Original Song at the 2018 Academy Awards . According to Sky News on March 25 , 2018 , " music critics have put the album 's success down to the feel-good , uplifting pop tunes which are also old school at the same time . " Sheila O'Malley of RogerEbert.com called the 11 songs " memorable , " praising the vocal performances of the leads . The women 's magazine '' Bustle '' gave it a positive review , particularly certain vocal performances . '' Stereogum '' described the soundtrack music as eclectic in its influences , giving it a negative reception for " serving up earnest buoyancy in many high-fructose flavors . " Also noting the eclectic mix of musical genres , '' The Ringer '' writes that " the bombastic tunes mix EDM gleams with stadium-rock grunts , chest-pounding ballads with peppy empowerment anthems , a thoroughly modern and disconcertingly eager post-genre assault designed to barnstorm as many Spotify playlists as possible . It 's a gilded cheese ball , pushing exhilaration to the point of exhaustion . " '' The Guardian '' wrote that the album brought " a whole lot of self-empowerment , enlivened with some deracinated R&B beats , and given the necessary gravitas by some power ballads of the sort that make one imagine the singer filmed from below with a wind machine blowing in their face .

                CONTEXT=The '' All Eyes on Sharon Tate '' documentary was used to publicize the film . Its 14 minutes consisted of a number of scenes depicting Tate filming '' Eye of the Devil '' , dancing in nightclubs , and sightseeing around London , and also contained a brief interview with her . Asked about her acting ambitions , she replied , " I do n't fool myself . I ca n't see myself doing Shakespeare . " She spoke of her hopes of finding a niche in comedy , and in other interviews she expressed her desire to become " a light comedienne in the Carole Lombard style " . She discussed the type of contemporary actress she wanted to emulate and explained that there were two in particular that she was influenced by : Faye Dunaway and Catherine Deneuve . Of the latter , she said , " I 'd like to be an American Catherine Deneuve . She plays beautiful , sensitive , deep parts with a little bit of intelligence behind them . " Later in the year , '' Valley of the Dolls '' opened to almost uniformly negative reviews . Bosley Crowther wrote in '' The New York Times '' , " all a fairly respectful admirer of movies can do is laugh at it and turn away " . '' Newsweek '' said that the film " has no more sense of its own ludicrousness than a village idiot stumbling in manure " , but a later article read : " Astoundingly photogenic , infinitely curvaceous , Sharon Tate is one of the most smashing young things to hit Hollywood in a long time . " The three lead actresses were castigated in numerous publications , including '' The Saturday Review '' , which wrote , " Ten years ago ... Parkins , Duke , and Tate would more likely have been playing the hat check girls than movie-queens ; they are totally lacking in style , authority , or charm . " '' The Hollywood Reporter '' provided some positive comments , such as , " Sharon Tate emerges as the film 's most sympathetic character ... William H. Daniels ' photographic caress of her faultless face and enormous absorbent eyes is stunning . " Roger Ebert of the '' Chicago Sun-Times '' praised Tate as " a wonder to behold " , but after describing the dialogue in one scene as " the most offensive and appalling vulgarity ever thrown up by any civilization " , concluded that , " I will be unable to take her any more seriously as a sex symbol than Raquel Welch . " In late 1967 , Tate and Polanski returned to London and were frequent subjects of newspaper and magazine articles . Tate was depicted as being untraditional and modern , and was quoted as saying couples should live together before marrying . They were married in Chelsea , London , on January 20 , 1968 , with considerable publicity . Polanski was dressed in what the press described as " Edwardian finery " , while Tate was attired in a white minidress . The couple moved into Polanski 's mews house off Eaton Square in Belgravia , London . Photographer Peter Evans later described them as " the imperfect couple . They were the Douglas Fairbanks/Mary Pickford of our time ... Cool , nomadic , talented , and nicely shocking . " While Tate reportedly wanted a traditional marriage , Polanski remained somewhat promiscuous and described Tate 's attitude to his infidelity as " Sharon 's big hang-up " . He reminded Tate that she had promised that she would not try to change him . Tate accepted Polanski 's conditions , though she confided to friends that she hoped he would change . Peter Evans quoted Tate as saying , " We have a good arrangement . Roman lies to me and I pretend to believe him . " Polanski urged Tate to end her association with Martin Ransohoff , and Tate began to place less importance on her career until Polanski told her he wanted to be married to " a hippie , not a housewife . " The couple returned to Los Angeles and quickly became part of a social group that included some of the most successful young people in the film industry , including Warren Beatty , Jacqueline Bisset , Leslie Caron , Joan Collins , Mia Farrow , Jane Fonda , Peter Fonda , Laurence Harvey , Steve McQueen , Joanna Pettet and Peter Sellers ; older film stars like Yul Brynner , Kirk Douglas , Henry Fonda and Danny Kaye ; musicians such as Jim Morrison and The Mamas & the Papas ; and record producer Terry Melcher and his girlfriend , actress Candice Bergen . Jay Sebring remained one of the couple 's more frequent companions . Polanski 's circle of friends included people he had known since his youth in Poland such as Wojciech Frykowski and Frykowski 's girlfriend , coffee heiress Abigail Folger . Tate and Polanski moved into the Chateau Marmont Hotel in Los Angeles for a few months until they arranged to lease Patty Duke 's home on Summit Ridge Drive in Beverly Hills during the latter part of 1968 . The Polanski house was often full of strangers , and Tate regarded the casual atmosphere as part of the " free spirit " of the times , saying that she did not mind who came into her home as her motto was " live and let live . " Her close friend Leslie Caron later commented that the Polanskis were too trusting — " to the point of recklessness " — and that she had been alarmed by it

                CONTEXT=Music critics favorably reviewed " Never Catch Me " . Named Best New Track by '' Pitchfork Media '' , editor Jayson Greene praised Lamar 's performance , writing " his hyper-vaulting flow and embedded rhyme patterns within rhyme patterns " . For its year-end list of " The 100 Best Tracks of 2014 " , '' Pitchfork '' ranked the song at number 23 . Also commenting on Lamar , '' Billboard '' 's Chris Payne wrote , " There are n't many A-list rappers who could handle a beat like this , but Kendrick is clearly one of them . " '' Rolling Stone '' editor Jon Dolan gave the song three-and-a-half out of five stars , commenting " Over offhandedly lovely , warp-speed psychedelic soul-jazz , Lamar unleashes a word-mad waterfall with a worried emotional core ( " analyze my demise I say I 'm super-anxious " , he raps ) . " '' Consequence of Sound '' editor Nina Corcoran wrote : " when combined with one of Lamar ’s hottest verses to date ( before '' To Pimp a Butterfly '' ) , the song explodes . But it does n’t stop there . FlyLo shows off his talent by shifting gears post-Kendrick verse the only way you can : insane keys , double-time bass drum , and unrelenting hand claps . Eventually , it ’s all swallowed up in massive swelling synth and choral hums , fading to a beautiful , passionate outro . " Directed by Hiro Murai , the video begins at a funeral ( including attendees Flying Lotus and Thundercat in cameo roles ) . Seemingly a sad video , it turns instantly joyful when the two late children - a boy and a girl - bound out of their caskets at the front of the church and dance gleefully down the aisle . The mourners ca n't see the children as they dance right out of the church and out onto a blacktop , but a group of other kids chases after them as they hop in a hearse and drive away . The clip was featured by several publications on their year-end list of best videos , including '' Pitchfork '' , '' Spin '' , and Stereogumwith the latter listing it at number one . The video received two nominations at the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards : Best Choreography and Best Cinematography , ultimately winning the latter

Some critics praised Dion 's performance , with '' Slant Magazine '' 's Eric Henderson writing it perfectly represents the singer as a " manic , Hallmark card-brandishing guru of schmaltz " . On the other hand , Stephen Erlewine of AllMusic called the cover " thoroughly colorless adult contemporary .

                CONTEXT=The '' All Eyes on Sharon Tate '' documentary was used to publicize the film . Its 14 minutes consisted of a number of scenes depicting Tate filming '' Eye of the Devil '' , dancing in nightclubs , and sightseeing around London , and also contained a brief interview with her . Asked about her acting ambitions , she replied , " I do n't fool myself . I ca n't see myself doing Shakespeare . " She spoke of her hopes of finding a niche in comedy , and in other interviews she expressed her desire to become " a light comedienne in the Carole Lombard style " . She discussed the type of contemporary actress she wanted to emulate and explained that there were two in particular that she was influenced by : Faye Dunaway and Catherine Deneuve . Of the latter , she said , " I 'd like to be an American Catherine Deneuve . She plays beautiful , sensitive , deep parts with a little bit of intelligence behind them . " Later in the year , '' Valley of the Dolls '' opened to almost uniformly negative reviews . Bosley Crowther wrote in '' The New York Times '' , " all a fairly respectful admirer of movies can do is laugh at it and turn away " . '' Newsweek '' said that the film " has no more sense of its own ludicrousness than a village idiot stumbling in manure " , but a later article read : " Astoundingly photogenic , infinitely curvaceous , Sharon Tate is one of the most smashing young things to hit Hollywood in a long time . " The three lead actresses were castigated in numerous publications , including '' The Saturday Review '' , which wrote , " Ten years ago ... Parkins , Duke , and Tate would more likely have been playing the hat check girls than movie-queens ; they are totally lacking in style , authority , or charm . " '' The Hollywood Reporter '' provided some positive comments , such as , " Sharon Tate emerges as the film 's most sympathetic character ... William H. Daniels ' photographic caress of her faultless face and enormous absorbent eyes is stunning . " Roger Ebert of the '' Chicago Sun-Times '' praised Tate as " a wonder to behold " , but after describing the dialogue in one scene as " the most offensive and appalling vulgarity ever thrown up by any civilization " , concluded that , " I will be unable to take her any more seriously as a sex symbol than Raquel Welch . " In late 1967 , Tate and Polanski returned to London and were frequent subjects of newspaper and magazine articles . Tate was depicted as being untraditional and modern , and was quoted as saying couples should live together before marrying . They were married in Chelsea , London , on January 20 , 1968 , with considerable publicity . Polanski was dressed in what the press described as " Edwardian finery " , while Tate was attired in a white minidress . The couple moved into Polanski 's mews house off Eaton Square in Belgravia , London . Photographer Peter Evans later described them as " the imperfect couple . They were the Douglas Fairbanks/Mary Pickford of our time ... Cool , nomadic , talented , and nicely shocking . " While Tate reportedly wanted a traditional marriage , Polanski remained somewhat promiscuous and described Tate 's attitude to his infidelity as " Sharon 's big hang-up " . He reminded Tate that she had promised that she would not try to change him . Tate accepted Polanski 's conditions , though she confided to friends that she hoped he would change . Peter Evans quoted Tate as saying , " We have a good arrangement . Roman lies to me and I pretend to believe him . " Polanski urged Tate to end her association with Martin Ransohoff , and Tate began to place less importance on her career until Polanski told her he wanted to be married to " a hippie , not a housewife . " The couple returned to Los Angeles and quickly became part of a social group that included some of the most successful young people in the film industry , including Warren Beatty , Jacqueline Bisset , Leslie Caron , Joan Collins , Mia Farrow , Jane Fonda , Peter Fonda , Laurence Harvey , Steve McQueen , Joanna Pettet and Peter Sellers ; older film stars like Yul Brynner , Kirk Douglas , Henry Fonda and Danny Kaye ; musicians such as Jim Morrison and The Mamas & the Papas ; and record producer Terry Melcher and his girlfriend , actress Candice Bergen . Jay Sebring remained one of the couple 's more frequent companions . Polanski 's circle of friends included people he had known since his youth in Poland such as Wojciech Frykowski and Frykowski 's girlfriend , coffee heiress Abigail Folger . Tate and Polanski moved into the Chateau Marmont Hotel in Los Angeles for a few months until they arranged to lease Patty Duke 's home on Summit Ridge Drive in Beverly Hills during the latter part of 1968 . The Polanski house was often full of strangers , and Tate regarded the casual atmosphere as part of the " free spirit " of the times , saying that she did not mind who came into her home as her motto was " live and let live . " Her close friend Leslie Caron later commented that the Polanskis were too trusting — " to the point of recklessness " — and that she had been alarmed by it

So I set out to make these tiny little fragments and then , of course , in the poetic sense , the idea of these little sound carrying objects traversing the planet , I started to think of these as a connection , as a sort of postcard into somebody 's life , into their space .

                CONTEXT=In September 2013 , Peake was appointed an Associate Artist of the Royal Exchange Theatre in Manchester . Her association with the theatre began in childhood and she was a member of the youth theatre . Major productions in which she has performed include '' The Children 's Hour '' in 2008 , for which she won a MEN Award , and '' Miss Julie '' in 2012 for which she won a Manchester Theatre Award . All of her performances at the Royal Exchange have been directed by Sarah Frankcom with whom she also collaborated on '' The Masque of Anarchy '' in 2012 for the Manchester International Festival . Building on this work , in September 2014 Frankcom went on to direct her as the title character in a radical re-imagining of '' Hamlet '' . The demand for tickets was so great that the production was extended for a week , having been " the theatre 's fastest-selling show in a decade " . '' The Guardian '' said of her performance : " Peake ’s delicate ferocity , her particular mixture of concentration and lightness , ensure that you want to follow her whenever she appears " . A year later she appeared in Frankcom 's production of '' The Skriker '' , as " Caryl Churchill 's shape-shifting , doom-wreaking fairy " . '' The Guardian '' 's Lyn Gardner listed the production in her top ten British plays of the year . In 2016 , Peake resumed her partnership with Royal Exchange Artistic Director , Sarah Frankcom , to star as Blanche Dubois in Tennessee Williams ' '' A Streetcar Named Desire '' . Peake 's performance in the role garnered critical acclaim with The Guardian describing her performance as " exquisite " and " breathtaking .

                CONTEXT=The '' All Eyes on Sharon Tate '' documentary was used to publicize the film . Its 14 minutes consisted of a number of scenes depicting Tate filming '' Eye of the Devil '' , dancing in nightclubs , and sightseeing around London , and also contained a brief interview with her . Asked about her acting ambitions , she replied , " I do n't fool myself . I ca n't see myself doing Shakespeare . " She spoke of her hopes of finding a niche in comedy , and in other interviews she expressed her desire to become " a light comedienne in the Carole Lombard style " . She discussed the type of contemporary actress she wanted to emulate and explained that there were two in particular that she was influenced by : Faye Dunaway and Catherine Deneuve . Of the latter , she said , " I 'd like to be an American Catherine Deneuve . She plays beautiful , sensitive , deep parts with a little bit of intelligence behind them . " Later in the year , '' Valley of the Dolls '' opened to almost uniformly negative reviews . Bosley Crowther wrote in '' The New York Times '' , " all a fairly respectful admirer of movies can do is laugh at it and turn away " . '' Newsweek '' said that the film " has no more sense of its own ludicrousness than a village idiot stumbling in manure " , but a later article read : " Astoundingly photogenic , infinitely curvaceous , Sharon Tate is one of the most smashing young things to hit Hollywood in a long time . " The three lead actresses were castigated in numerous publications , including '' The Saturday Review '' , which wrote , " Ten years ago ... Parkins , Duke , and Tate would more likely have been playing the hat check girls than movie-queens ; they are totally lacking in style , authority , or charm . " '' The Hollywood Reporter '' provided some positive comments , such as , " Sharon Tate emerges as the film 's most sympathetic character ... William H. Daniels ' photographic caress of her faultless face and enormous absorbent eyes is stunning . " Roger Ebert of the '' Chicago Sun-Times '' praised Tate as " a wonder to behold " , but after describing the dialogue in one scene as " the most offensive and appalling vulgarity ever thrown up by any civilization " , concluded that , " I will be unable to take her any more seriously as a sex symbol than Raquel Welch . " In late 1967 , Tate and Polanski returned to London and were frequent subjects of newspaper and magazine articles . Tate was depicted as being untraditional and modern , and was quoted as saying couples should live together before marrying . They were married in Chelsea , London , on January 20 , 1968 , with considerable publicity . Polanski was dressed in what the press described as " Edwardian finery " , while Tate was attired in a white minidress . The couple moved into Polanski 's mews house off Eaton Square in Belgravia , London . Photographer Peter Evans later described them as " the imperfect couple . They were the Douglas Fairbanks/Mary Pickford of our time ... Cool , nomadic , talented , and nicely shocking . " While Tate reportedly wanted a traditional marriage , Polanski remained somewhat promiscuous and described Tate 's attitude to his infidelity as " Sharon 's big hang-up " . He reminded Tate that she had promised that she would not try to change him . Tate accepted Polanski 's conditions , though she confided to friends that she hoped he would change . Peter Evans quoted Tate as saying , " We have a good arrangement . Roman lies to me and I pretend to believe him . " Polanski urged Tate to end her association with Martin Ransohoff , and Tate began to place less importance on her career until Polanski told her he wanted to be married to " a hippie , not a housewife . " The couple returned to Los Angeles and quickly became part of a social group that included some of the most successful young people in the film industry , including Warren Beatty , Jacqueline Bisset , Leslie Caron , Joan Collins , Mia Farrow , Jane Fonda , Peter Fonda , Laurence Harvey , Steve McQueen , Joanna Pettet and Peter Sellers ; older film stars like Yul Brynner , Kirk Douglas , Henry Fonda and Danny Kaye ; musicians such as Jim Morrison and The Mamas & the Papas ; and record producer Terry Melcher and his girlfriend , actress Candice Bergen . Jay Sebring remained one of the couple 's more frequent companions . Polanski 's circle of friends included people he had known since his youth in Poland such as Wojciech Frykowski and Frykowski 's girlfriend , coffee heiress Abigail Folger . Tate and Polanski moved into the Chateau Marmont Hotel in Los Angeles for a few months until they arranged to lease Patty Duke 's home on Summit Ridge Drive in Beverly Hills during the latter part of 1968 . The Polanski house was often full of strangers , and Tate regarded the casual atmosphere as part of the " free spirit " of the times , saying that she did not mind who came into her home as her motto was " live and let live . " Her close friend Leslie Caron later commented that the Polanskis were too trusting — " to the point of recklessness " — and that she had been alarmed by it

For its year-end list of " The 100 Best Tracks of 2014 " , '' Pitchfork '' ranked the song at number 23 . Also commenting on Lamar , '' Billboard '' 's Chris Payne wrote , " There are n't many A-list rappers who could handle a beat like this , but Kendrick is clearly one of them .

But it does n’t stop there . FlyLo shows off his talent by shifting gears post-Kendrick verse the only way you can : insane keys , double-time bass drum , and unrelenting hand claps . Eventually , it ’s all swallowed up in massive swelling synth and choral hums , fading to a beautiful , passionate outro . " Directed by Hiro Murai , the video begins at a funeral ( including attendees Flying Lotus and Thundercat in cameo roles ) . Seemingly a sad video , it turns instantly joyful when the two late children - a boy and a girl - bound out of their caskets at the front of the church and dance gleefully down the aisle . The mourners ca n't see the children as they dance right out of the church and out onto a blacktop , but a group of other kids chases after them as they hop in a hearse and drive away . The clip was featured by several publications on their year-end list of best videos , including '' Pitchfork '' , '' Spin '' , and Stereogumwith the latter listing it at number one . The video received two nominations at the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards : Best Choreography and Best Cinematography , ultimately winning the latter

                CONTEXT=Betrayal is the secondary theme of '' The Wild Bunch '' . The characters suffer from their knowledge of having betrayed a friend and left him to his fate , thus violating their own honor code when it suits them ( " $ 10,000 cuts an awful lot of family ties " ) . However , Bishop says , " When you side with a man , you stay with him , and if you ca n't do that you 're like some animal . " Such oppositional ideas lead to the film 's violent conclusion , as the remaining men find their abandonment of Angel intolerable . Bishop remembers his betrayals , most notably when he deserts Deke Thornton ( in flashback ) when the law catches up to them and when he abandons Crazy Lee at the railroad office after the robbery ( ostensibly to guard the hostages ) . Critic David Weddle writes that , " like that of Conrad 's '' Lord Jim '' , Pike Bishop 's heroism is propelled by overwhelming guilt and a despairing death wish . " Vincent Canby began his review by calling the film " very beautiful and the first truly interesting American-made Western in years . It 's also so full of violence — of an intensity that can hardly be supported by the story — that it 's going to prompt a lot of people who do not know the real effect of movie violence ( as I do not ) to write automatic condemnations of it . " He observed , " Although the movie 's conventional and poetic action sequences are extraordinarily good and its landscapes beautifully photographed ... it is most interesting in its almost jolly account of chaos , corruption , and defeat " . About the actors , he commented particularly on William Holden : " After years of giving bored performances in boring movies , Holden comes back gallantly in '' The Wild Bunch '' . He looks older and tired , but he has style , both as a man and as a movie character who persists in doing what he 's always done , not because he really wants the money but because there 's simply nothing else to do . " '' TIME '' also liked Holden 's performance , describing it as his best since '' Stalag 17 '' ( a 1953 film that earned Holden an Oscar ) , noting Robert Ryan gave " the screen performance of his career " , and concluding that " '' The Wild Bunch '' contains faults and mistakes " ( such as flashbacks " introduced with surprising clumsiness " ) , but " its accomplishments are more than sufficient to confirm that Peckinpah , along with Stanley Kubrick and Arthur Penn , belongs with the best of the newer generation of American filmmakers . " In a 2002 retrospective Roger Ebert , who " saw the original version at the world premiere in 1969 , during the golden age of the junket , when Warner Bros. screened five of its new films in the Bahamas for 450 critics and reporters " , said that back then he had publicly declared the film a masterpiece during the junket 's press conference , prompted by comments from " a reporter from the '' Reader 's Digest '' who got up to ask ' Why was this film ever made ? ' " He compared the film to '' Pulp Fiction '' : " praised and condemned with equal vehemence . " " What '' Citizen Kane '' was to movie lovers in 1941 , '' The Wild Bunch '' was to cineastes in 1969 , " wrote film critic Michael Sragow , who added that Peckinpah had " produced an American movie that equals or surpasses the best of Kurosawa : the Gotterdammerung of Westerns "

Located in Washington , D.C. , this professional improvisational theater offered participatory workshops to children , youth , teachers , parents , and community members . Living Stage ’s main philosophy was based in the belief that every one is born an artist and the act of creation is the ultimate act of self - affirmation . The company 's mission was to transform individuals and communities through creative empowerment . The projects that the Living Stage put on typically dealt with controversial and sensitive topics like race , economic inequality , the dangers of an overzealous American foreign policy , the atom bomb , violence , and freedom . The " Baltimore Incident " of 1971 is an excellent example of how controversial these productions could be . No matter how mixed opinions were , the Living Stage always elicited a reaction with their improvisational performances . During the 1980s the Living Stage began to reach out extensively to local initiatives like The District 's Alcohol and Drug Abuse Services Administration and created their own Community Services Project in order to continue to bring theater and creativity to underserved sections of society . The Living Stage championed New Left ideals like equality and social justice throughout the Reagan years , despite some criticisms about their message being " anachronistic " . The Living Stage dissolved after 36 years and was a venture of Arena Stage .

                CONTEXT=The '' All Eyes on Sharon Tate '' documentary was used to publicize the film . Its 14 minutes consisted of a number of scenes depicting Tate filming '' Eye of the Devil '' , dancing in nightclubs , and sightseeing around London , and also contained a brief interview with her . Asked about her acting ambitions , she replied , " I do n't fool myself . I ca n't see myself doing Shakespeare . " She spoke of her hopes of finding a niche in comedy , and in other interviews she expressed her desire to become " a light comedienne in the Carole Lombard style " . She discussed the type of contemporary actress she wanted to emulate and explained that there were two in particular that she was influenced by : Faye Dunaway and Catherine Deneuve . Of the latter , she said , " I 'd like to be an American Catherine Deneuve . She plays beautiful , sensitive , deep parts with a little bit of intelligence behind them . " Later in the year , '' Valley of the Dolls '' opened to almost uniformly negative reviews . Bosley Crowther wrote in '' The New York Times '' , " all a fairly respectful admirer of movies can do is laugh at it and turn away " . '' Newsweek '' said that the film " has no more sense of its own ludicrousness than a village idiot stumbling in manure " , but a later article read : " Astoundingly photogenic , infinitely curvaceous , Sharon Tate is one of the most smashing young things to hit Hollywood in a long time . " The three lead actresses were castigated in numerous publications , including '' The Saturday Review '' , which wrote , " Ten years ago ... Parkins , Duke , and Tate would more likely have been playing the hat check girls than movie-queens ; they are totally lacking in style , authority , or charm . " '' The Hollywood Reporter '' provided some positive comments , such as , " Sharon Tate emerges as the film 's most sympathetic character ... William H. Daniels ' photographic caress of her faultless face and enormous absorbent eyes is stunning . " Roger Ebert of the '' Chicago Sun-Times '' praised Tate as " a wonder to behold " , but after describing the dialogue in one scene as " the most offensive and appalling vulgarity ever thrown up by any civilization " , concluded that , " I will be unable to take her any more seriously as a sex symbol than Raquel Welch . " In late 1967 , Tate and Polanski returned to London and were frequent subjects of newspaper and magazine articles . Tate was depicted as being untraditional and modern , and was quoted as saying couples should live together before marrying . They were married in Chelsea , London , on January 20 , 1968 , with considerable publicity . Polanski was dressed in what the press described as " Edwardian finery " , while Tate was attired in a white minidress . The couple moved into Polanski 's mews house off Eaton Square in Belgravia , London . Photographer Peter Evans later described them as " the imperfect couple . They were the Douglas Fairbanks/Mary Pickford of our time ... Cool , nomadic , talented , and nicely shocking . " While Tate reportedly wanted a traditional marriage , Polanski remained somewhat promiscuous and described Tate 's attitude to his infidelity as " Sharon 's big hang-up " . He reminded Tate that she had promised that she would not try to change him . Tate accepted Polanski 's conditions , though she confided to friends that she hoped he would change . Peter Evans quoted Tate as saying , " We have a good arrangement . Roman lies to me and I pretend to believe him . " Polanski urged Tate to end her association with Martin Ransohoff , and Tate began to place less importance on her career until Polanski told her he wanted to be married to " a hippie , not a housewife . " The couple returned to Los Angeles and quickly became part of a social group that included some of the most successful young people in the film industry , including Warren Beatty , Jacqueline Bisset , Leslie Caron , Joan Collins , Mia Farrow , Jane Fonda , Peter Fonda , Laurence Harvey , Steve McQueen , Joanna Pettet and Peter Sellers ; older film stars like Yul Brynner , Kirk Douglas , Henry Fonda and Danny Kaye ; musicians such as Jim Morrison and The Mamas & the Papas ; and record producer Terry Melcher and his girlfriend , actress Candice Bergen . Jay Sebring remained one of the couple 's more frequent companions . Polanski 's circle of friends included people he had known since his youth in Poland such as Wojciech Frykowski and Frykowski 's girlfriend , coffee heiress Abigail Folger . Tate and Polanski moved into the Chateau Marmont Hotel in Los Angeles for a few months until they arranged to lease Patty Duke 's home on Summit Ridge Drive in Beverly Hills during the latter part of 1968 . The Polanski house was often full of strangers , and Tate regarded the casual atmosphere as part of the " free spirit " of the times , saying that she did not mind who came into her home as her motto was " live and let live . " Her close friend Leslie Caron later commented that the Polanskis were too trusting — " to the point of recklessness " — and that she had been alarmed by it

                CONTEXT=The '' All Eyes on Sharon Tate '' documentary was used to publicize the film . Its 14 minutes consisted of a number of scenes depicting Tate filming '' Eye of the Devil '' , dancing in nightclubs , and sightseeing around London , and also contained a brief interview with her . Asked about her acting ambitions , she replied , " I do n't fool myself . I ca n't see myself doing Shakespeare . " She spoke of her hopes of finding a niche in comedy , and in other interviews she expressed her desire to become " a light comedienne in the Carole Lombard style " . She discussed the type of contemporary actress she wanted to emulate and explained that there were two in particular that she was influenced by : Faye Dunaway and Catherine Deneuve . Of the latter , she said , " I 'd like to be an American Catherine Deneuve . She plays beautiful , sensitive , deep parts with a little bit of intelligence behind them . " Later in the year , '' Valley of the Dolls '' opened to almost uniformly negative reviews . Bosley Crowther wrote in '' The New York Times '' , " all a fairly respectful admirer of movies can do is laugh at it and turn away " . '' Newsweek '' said that the film " has no more sense of its own ludicrousness than a village idiot stumbling in manure " , but a later article read : " Astoundingly photogenic , infinitely curvaceous , Sharon Tate is one of the most smashing young things to hit Hollywood in a long time . " The three lead actresses were castigated in numerous publications , including '' The Saturday Review '' , which wrote , " Ten years ago ... Parkins , Duke , and Tate would more likely have been playing the hat check girls than movie-queens ; they are totally lacking in style , authority , or charm . " '' The Hollywood Reporter '' provided some positive comments , such as , " Sharon Tate emerges as the film 's most sympathetic character ... William H. Daniels ' photographic caress of her faultless face and enormous absorbent eyes is stunning . " Roger Ebert of the '' Chicago Sun-Times '' praised Tate as " a wonder to behold " , but after describing the dialogue in one scene as " the most offensive and appalling vulgarity ever thrown up by any civilization " , concluded that , " I will be unable to take her any more seriously as a sex symbol than Raquel Welch . " In late 1967 , Tate and Polanski returned to London and were frequent subjects of newspaper and magazine articles . Tate was depicted as being untraditional and modern , and was quoted as saying couples should live together before marrying . They were married in Chelsea , London , on January 20 , 1968 , with considerable publicity . Polanski was dressed in what the press described as " Edwardian finery " , while Tate was attired in a white minidress . The couple moved into Polanski 's mews house off Eaton Square in Belgravia , London . Photographer Peter Evans later described them as " the imperfect couple . They were the Douglas Fairbanks/Mary Pickford of our time ... Cool , nomadic , talented , and nicely shocking . " While Tate reportedly wanted a traditional marriage , Polanski remained somewhat promiscuous and described Tate 's attitude to his infidelity as " Sharon 's big hang-up " . He reminded Tate that she had promised that she would not try to change him . Tate accepted Polanski 's conditions , though she confided to friends that she hoped he would change . Peter Evans quoted Tate as saying , " We have a good arrangement . Roman lies to me and I pretend to believe him . " Polanski urged Tate to end her association with Martin Ransohoff , and Tate began to place less importance on her career until Polanski told her he wanted to be married to " a hippie , not a housewife . " The couple returned to Los Angeles and quickly became part of a social group that included some of the most successful young people in the film industry , including Warren Beatty , Jacqueline Bisset , Leslie Caron , Joan Collins , Mia Farrow , Jane Fonda , Peter Fonda , Laurence Harvey , Steve McQueen , Joanna Pettet and Peter Sellers ; older film stars like Yul Brynner , Kirk Douglas , Henry Fonda and Danny Kaye ; musicians such as Jim Morrison and The Mamas & the Papas ; and record producer Terry Melcher and his girlfriend , actress Candice Bergen . Jay Sebring remained one of the couple 's more frequent companions . Polanski 's circle of friends included people he had known since his youth in Poland such as Wojciech Frykowski and Frykowski 's girlfriend , coffee heiress Abigail Folger . Tate and Polanski moved into the Chateau Marmont Hotel in Los Angeles for a few months until they arranged to lease Patty Duke 's home on Summit Ridge Drive in Beverly Hills during the latter part of 1968 . The Polanski house was often full of strangers , and Tate regarded the casual atmosphere as part of the " free spirit " of the times , saying that she did not mind who came into her home as her motto was " live and let live . " Her close friend Leslie Caron later commented that the Polanskis were too trusting — " to the point of recklessness " — and that she had been alarmed by it

                CONTEXT=Loft jazz ( or the loft scene or loft era ) was a cultural phenomenon that occurred in New York City during the mid-1970s . Gary Giddins described it as follows : " [ A ] new coterie of avant - garde musicians took much of the jazz world by surprise ... [ T ] hey interpreted the idea of freedom as the capacity to choose between all the realms of jazz , mixing and matching them not only with each other , but with old and new pop , r & b and rock , classical music and world music ... [ S ] eemingly overnight new venues - in many instances , apartments or lofts ( hence the phrase ' loft jazz ' ) - opened shop to present their wares . " According to Michael Heller , " lofts were not an organization , nor a movement , nor an ideology , nor a genre , nor a neighborhood , nor a lineage of individuals . They were , instead , a meeting point , a locus for interaction . " Heller stated that " loft practices came to be defined by a number of key characteristics , including ( 1 ) low admission charges or suggested donations , ( 2 ) casual atmospheres that blurred the distinction between performer and audience , ( 3 ) ownership / administration by musicians , and ( 4 ) mixed - use spaces that combined both private living areas and public presentation space . " Regarding the music played in these venues , Michael J. Agovino wrote : " This was community music . Part of the point was that , free of the strictures of clubs , the music could be anything , go anywhere , go on for as long as it wanted . " David Such stated that " the cutting contests , personality cults , and vices that characterized the jazz scene of the 1940s and 1950s were mostly missing . " The scene was reviewed and documented by Giddins , Peter Occhiogrosso of the SoHo Weekly News , Leroi Jones , Robert Palmer , and Stanley Crouch .

But it does n’t stop there . FlyLo shows off his talent by shifting gears post-Kendrick verse the only way you can : insane keys , double-time bass drum , and unrelenting hand claps .

He also questioned the purpose of the " Year of the Woman " theme writing , " The Oscar show itself seemed at odds with its own feminist theme .

" He also wrote that , " The song medley is getting old hat , " and the " smug references to his flop '' Mr. Saturday Night '' were out of an improv amateur night . " The telecast also received unfavorable reaction from various public feminist figures . In an interview with '' Los Angeles Daily News '' author and activist Betty Friedan condemned the " Year of the Woman " theme commenting , " It had no basis in reality . On behalf of women directors , cinematographer , and producers , I resent the travesty of calling that a tribute . " Likewise , President of the National Organization for Women 's Los Angeles chapter Tammy Bruce chastised ceremony 's feminist tribute as " one of the most hypocritical , patronizing things I saw in my whole life . " In response , Gil Cates responded towards the criticism of the theme stating , " The theme developed and raised consciousness in a way that I think is positive , not only for the individual in general but for individual women specifically . " He also quoted an ancient Chinese proverb later made famous by former U.S. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt saying , " It is better to light one candle than to curse the darkness " Despite the adverse reception , the ABC broadcast drew in an average of 45.7 million people over its length , which was a 3 % increase from the previous year 's ceremony . The show also drew higher Nielsen ratings compared to the previous ceremony with 31.2 % of households watching over a 51 share .

It was written in the summer of 1865 during a period of profound national mourning in the aftermath of the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln on April 14 , 1865 . Despite the poem being an elegy to the fallen president , Whitman neither mentions Lincoln by name nor discusses the circumstances of his death . Instead , Whitman uses a series of rural and natural imagery including the symbols of the lilacs , a drooping star in the western sky ( Venus ) , and the hermit thrush , and employs the traditional progression of the pastoral elegy in moving from grief toward an acceptance and knowledge of death . The poem also addresses the pity of war through imagery vaguely referencing the American Civil War ( 1861 – 1865 ) which ended only days before the assassination

                CONTEXT=The album received mixed reviews from music critics . According to review aggregator Metacritic , the album has a score of 48/100 based on 8 reviews , indicating " mixed or average reviews " . On another aggregator website , Album of the Year , it holds the 4th position on a list of worst reviewed albums of 2014 . Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic gave the album 2.5 stars out of 5 saying that " Michele is not a natural pop star . This was true in 2009 when she debuted on '' Glee '' as Rachel Berry and it 's even clearer in 2014 . " Mike Ayers from '' Billboard '' gave a mostly positive review , saying , " Lyrically , '' Louder '' is rather one-sided , as she often sings about the perils of relationships , over and over , in ways that we 've all heard many times at this point . Still , it 's a solid effort that shows she has promise as a bonafide pop artist . " Sarah Rodman of '' The Boston Globe '' gave the album a mostly positive review , writing , " The Broadway veteran puts her mighty soprano through its paces on bouncy dance tracks , soaring ballads , and midtempo pop tunes where she straddles the line , mostly comfortably , between Katy Perry and Celine Dion . " Kyle Anderson of '' Entertainment Weekly '' gave the album a B - , writing , " It 's hard to be that mad at '' Louder '' , because it 's so admirably and lovingly crafted . There 's nothing wrong with Lea Michele 's debut , and that 's its biggest problem . While well curated and exquisitely executed , '' Louder '' is missing the visceral oomph that defines the gulf between superstars and the rest of the top 40 chum . " At '' USA Today '' , Jerry Shriver rated the album 2.5 stars out of four , and stated that " softer would have been a better approach . " He added that the song " Battlefield " points to a more promising direction . Kevin McFarland of '' The A.V. Club '' gave a C - rating , writing , " '' Louder '' , Michele 's debut solo album under her own name , does feature her distinctive talent as a vocalist . But the record is caught in an unfortunate stylistic limbo between fun-loving , youthful pop and the maturity of adult contemporary artists . " Jim Farber of the '' New York Daily News '' awarded the album two stars . He criticized , " Michele does n't so much sing as trumpet like an elephant eager for the charge . Her voice has more need than vulnerability , more anger than understanding . " Christopher R. Weingarten of '' Rolling Stone '' also gave a negative review , stating , " This album of insta-dated EDM-pop anthems and half-cocked bass drops probably wo n't help Michele 's cause . The songs about love 's ups and downs have a few memorable lyrics ( ' My heart 's too drunk to drive ' ) but not nearly enough . " '' Louder '' was nominated for World 's Best Album at the 2014 World Music Awards , held in Monaco on May 27 , 2014

He also questioned the purpose of the " Year of the Woman " theme writing , " The Oscar show itself seemed at odds with its own feminist theme . " Robert Bianco from the '' Pittsburgh Post-Gazette '' derided Allen 's musical production numbers , comparing them to the disastrous opening number at the 61st ceremony held in 1989 . Columnist Matt Roush of '' USA Today '' complained , " Crystal , in a by-now-familiar performance , has , in four years , taken a plum assignment and , by repetition , reduced it to shtick . " He also wrote that , " The song medley is getting old hat , " and the " smug references to his flop '' Mr. Saturday Night '' were out of an improv amateur night . " The telecast also received unfavorable reaction from various public feminist figures . In an interview with '' Los Angeles Daily News '' author and activist Betty Friedan condemned the " Year of the Woman " theme commenting , " It had no basis in reality . On behalf of women directors , cinematographer , and producers , I resent the travesty of calling that a tribute . " Likewise , President of the National Organization for Women 's Los Angeles chapter Tammy Bruce chastised ceremony 's feminist tribute as " one of the most hypocritical , patronizing things I saw in my whole life . " In response , Gil Cates responded towards the criticism of the theme stating , " The theme developed and raised consciousness in a way that I think is positive , not only for the individual in general but for individual women specifically . " He also quoted an ancient Chinese proverb later made famous by former U.S. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt saying , " It is better to light one candle than to curse the darkness " Despite the adverse reception , the ABC broadcast drew in an average of 45.7 million people over its length , which was a 3 % increase from the previous year 's ceremony . The show also drew higher Nielsen ratings compared to the previous ceremony with 31.2 % of households watching over a 51 share . It also drew a higher 18 – 49 demo rating with a 20.1 rating among viewers in that demographic

                CONTEXT=Betrayal is the secondary theme of '' The Wild Bunch '' . The characters suffer from their knowledge of having betrayed a friend and left him to his fate , thus violating their own honor code when it suits them ( " $ 10,000 cuts an awful lot of family ties " ) . However , Bishop says , " When you side with a man , you stay with him , and if you ca n't do that you 're like some animal . " Such oppositional ideas lead to the film 's violent conclusion , as the remaining men find their abandonment of Angel intolerable . Bishop remembers his betrayals , most notably when he deserts Deke Thornton ( in flashback ) when the law catches up to them and when he abandons Crazy Lee at the railroad office after the robbery ( ostensibly to guard the hostages ) . Critic David Weddle writes that , " like that of Conrad 's '' Lord Jim '' , Pike Bishop 's heroism is propelled by overwhelming guilt and a despairing death wish . " Vincent Canby began his review by calling the film " very beautiful and the first truly interesting American-made Western in years . It 's also so full of violence — of an intensity that can hardly be supported by the story — that it 's going to prompt a lot of people who do not know the real effect of movie violence ( as I do not ) to write automatic condemnations of it . " He observed , " Although the movie 's conventional and poetic action sequences are extraordinarily good and its landscapes beautifully photographed ... it is most interesting in its almost jolly account of chaos , corruption , and defeat " . About the actors , he commented particularly on William Holden : " After years of giving bored performances in boring movies , Holden comes back gallantly in '' The Wild Bunch '' . He looks older and tired , but he has style , both as a man and as a movie character who persists in doing what he 's always done , not because he really wants the money but because there 's simply nothing else to do . " '' TIME '' also liked Holden 's performance , describing it as his best since '' Stalag 17 '' ( a 1953 film that earned Holden an Oscar ) , noting Robert Ryan gave " the screen performance of his career " , and concluding that " '' The Wild Bunch '' contains faults and mistakes " ( such as flashbacks " introduced with surprising clumsiness " ) , but " its accomplishments are more than sufficient to confirm that Peckinpah , along with Stanley Kubrick and Arthur Penn , belongs with the best of the newer generation of American filmmakers . " In a 2002 retrospective Roger Ebert , who " saw the original version at the world premiere in 1969 , during the golden age of the junket , when Warner Bros. screened five of its new films in the Bahamas for 450 critics and reporters " , said that back then he had publicly declared the film a masterpiece during the junket 's press conference , prompted by comments from " a reporter from the '' Reader 's Digest '' who got up to ask ' Why was this film ever made ? ' " He compared the film to '' Pulp Fiction '' : " praised and condemned with equal vehemence . " " What '' Citizen Kane '' was to movie lovers in 1941 , '' The Wild Bunch '' was to cineastes in 1969 , " wrote film critic Michael Sragow , who added that Peckinpah had " produced an American movie that equals or surpasses the best of Kurosawa : the Gotterdammerung of Westerns "

Seemingly a sad video , it turns instantly joyful when the two late children - a boy and a girl - bound out of their caskets at the front of the church and dance gleefully down the aisle . The mourners ca n't see the children as they dance right out of the church and out onto a blacktop , but a group of other kids chases after them as they hop in a hearse and drive away . The clip was featured by several publications on their year-end list of best videos , including '' Pitchfork '' , '' Spin '' , and Stereogumwith the latter listing it at number one .

                CONTEXT=Grand Theft Auto V is an open world , action - adventure video game developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games . Upon its release for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on 17 September 2013 , the game generated controversies related to its violence and depiction of women . A mission that requires players to use torture equipment in a hostage interrogation polarised reviewers , who noted its political commentary but felt that the torture sequence was in poor taste . The mission also received criticism from politicians and anti-torture charity groups . The game became subject to widespread online debate over its portrayal of women , particularly in the wake of backlash against GameSpot journalist Carolyn Petit after she claimed the game was misogynistic in her review . After Petit 's review webpage received more than 20,000 largely negative comments , many journalists defended her right to an opinion and lamented the gaming community 's hostility towards criticism . Television personality Karen Gravano and actress Lindsay Lohan both filed lawsuits against Rockstar in allegation that characters in the game were based on their likenesses . Target 's Australian division pulled the game from their 300 stores following a Change.org petition that claimed the game " encourages players to commit sexual violence and kill women " , despite the petition being criticised as misleading and portrayals of sexual violence in games already being illegal in Australia .

It had a population of 71 households and 20 bachelors ; all Muslim . The villagers paid taxes on goats and beehives , but most of its taxes were in the form of a fixed sum , total taxes were 30,750 akçe . In the 17th century , the village was inhabited by Druze .

Yet what beautiful boys and girls they have ! And what a climate ! Every one of these girls has queenly , gazelle-like , bewitching eyes , which captivate the beholder — an unusual sight . The Galilee earthquake of 1837 caused widespread damage and over 200 deaths . Three weeks afterward , contemporaries reported " a large rent in the ground ... about a foot wide and fifty feet long . " All the Galilee villages that were badly damaged at the time , including Jish , were situated on the slopes of steep hills . The presence of old landslides has been observed on aerial photographs . The fact that the village was built on dip slopes consisting of soft bedrock and soil has made it more vulnerable to landslides . According to Andrew Thomson , no houses in Jish were left standing . The church fell , killing 130 people and the old town walls collapsed . A total of 235 people died and the ground was left fissured . At the time , the village was noted as a mixed Muslim and Maronite village in the Safad district . At the end of the 19th century , Jish was described as a " well-built village of good masonry " with about 600 Christian and 200 Muslim inhabitants

Those criticizing this move included film director Barry Levinson , co-screenwriter Ronald Bass , and George Kirgo ( at the time the President of the Writers Guild of America , West ) . " I think it 's a key scene to the entire movie , " Levinson said in a telephone interview . " That 's why it 's in there . It launches their entire odyssey across country – because they could n't fly . " While some of those airlines cited as justification avoiding having airplane passengers feel uncomfortable in sympathy with Raymond during the in-flight entertainment , the scene was shown intact on flights of Qantas , and commentators noted that Raymond mentions '' it '' as the only airline whose planes have " never crashed " .

David Fricke of '' Rolling Stone '' magazine gave a mostly positive review , describing '' Tragic Kingdom '' as " ear candy with good beats , not just bludgeon-by-numbers guitars " and its music as " a spry , white-suburban take on ska and Blondieesque pop " . Fricke however described " Do n't Speak " as " irritating swill " with " high-pitched rippling " from Gwen Stefani . In 2003 , the album was ranked number 441 on '' Rolling Stone '' magazine 's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time . '' Entertainment Weekly '' s David Browne attributed the album 's sales to Gwen Stefani 's " leggy , bleached-blond calling card " and concluded that " sex still sells " . Browne , however , described the music as " a hefty chunk of new-wave party bounce and Chili Peppers-style white-boy funk , with dashes of reggae , squealing hair-metal guitar , disco , ska-band horns " and the band as sounding like " savvy , lounge-bred pros " . Individual songs were singled out and commented on : " Just a Girl " was described as " a chirpy , ska-tinged bopper " , " Do n't Speak " as " an old-fangled power ballad " , " Sixteen " as a " song of solidarity with misunderstood teenage girls " , and " Spiderwebs " and " End It on This " as " Stefani acknowledg ing obsessions with losers and tr ying to break free . " Calling the album a marked improvement over " the diffuse , rambling songwriting of No Doubt 's two previous CDs " , Mike Boehm of the '' Los Angeles Times '' felt that on the album , " The band is bright , hard-hitting and kinetic , as sharp production captures the core , four-man instrumental team and adjunct horn section at their best " . In a favorable review for '' The Village Voice '' , critic Chuck Eddy felt that although " the album turns pretentious ... No Doubt resurrects the exuberance new-wave guys lost when '80s indie labels and college radio conned them into settling for slam-pit fits and wallflower wallpaper " . AllMusic called it " pure fun " and described the music as something " between '90s punk , third-wave ska , and pop sensibility " and a mix of " new wave melodicism , post-grunge rock , and West Coast sunshine " , indicating the songs " Spiderwebs " , " Just a Girl " , and " Do n't Speak " as " positively ruling the airwaves " . Yahoo! Music reviewer Bill Holdship called the album a " phenomenon " containing " hit after hit " , and describing " Spiderwebs " as " a terrific opener " . Reviewer Robert Christgau called Stefani " hebephrenic " and the album " hyped up " and not " as songful as its fun-besotted partisans claim " . At the 1997 Grammy Awards , No Doubt were nominated for Best New Artist and Best Rock Album

Upon its release for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on 17 September 2013 , the game generated controversies related to its violence and depiction of women . A mission that requires players to use torture equipment in a hostage interrogation polarised reviewers , who noted its political commentary but felt that the torture sequence was in poor taste . The mission also received criticism from politicians and anti-torture charity groups . The game became subject to widespread online debate over its portrayal of women , particularly in the wake of backlash against GameSpot journalist Carolyn Petit after she claimed the game was misogynistic in her review . After Petit 's review webpage received more than 20,000 largely negative comments , many journalists defended her right to an opinion and lamented the gaming community 's hostility towards criticism . Television personality Karen Gravano and actress Lindsay Lohan both filed lawsuits against Rockstar in allegation that characters in the game were based on their likenesses . Target 's Australian division pulled the game from their 300 stores following a Change.org petition that claimed the game " encourages players to commit sexual violence and kill women " , despite the petition being criticised as misleading and portrayals of sexual violence in games already being illegal in Australia .

For its year-end list of " The 100 Best Tracks of 2014 " , '' Pitchfork '' ranked the song at number 23 . Also commenting on Lamar , '' Billboard '' 's Chris Payne wrote , " There are n't many A-list rappers who could handle a beat like this , but Kendrick is clearly one of them . " '' Rolling Stone '' editor Jon Dolan gave the song three-and-a-half out of five stars , commenting " Over offhandedly lovely , warp-speed psychedelic soul-jazz , Lamar unleashes a word-mad waterfall with a worried emotional core ( " analyze my demise I say I 'm super-anxious " , he raps ) . " '' Consequence of Sound '' editor Nina Corcoran wrote : " when combined with one of Lamar ’s hottest verses to date ( before '' To Pimp a Butterfly '' ) , the song explodes . But it does n’t stop there . FlyLo shows off his talent by shifting gears post-Kendrick verse the only way you can : insane keys , double-time bass drum , and unrelenting hand claps . Eventually , it ’s all swallowed up in massive swelling synth and choral hums , fading to a beautiful , passionate outro . " Directed by Hiro Murai , the video begins at a funeral ( including attendees Flying Lotus and Thundercat in cameo roles ) . Seemingly a sad video , it turns instantly joyful when the two late children - a boy and a girl - bound out of their caskets at the front of the church and dance gleefully down the aisle . The mourners ca n't see the children as they dance right out of the church and out onto a blacktop , but a group of other kids chases after them as they hop in a hearse and drive away . The clip was featured by several publications on their year-end list of best videos , including '' Pitchfork '' , '' Spin '' , and Stereogumwith the latter listing it at number one . The video received two nominations at the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards : Best Choreography and Best Cinematography , ultimately winning the latter

Heretofore , their albums featured a distinctive " No Synthesisers ! " sleeve note . The note is widely assumed to reflect an anti-synth , pro- " hard " - rock stance by the band , but was later revealed by producer Roy Thomas Baker to be an attempt to clarify that those albums ' multi-layered solos were created with guitars , not synths , as record company executives kept assuming at the time . In September 1980 , Queen performed three sold-out shows at Madison Square Garden . In 1980 , Queen also released the soundtrack they had recorded for '' Flash Gordon '' .

                CONTEXT=Crop Over is a traditional harvest festival which began in Barbados , having had its early beginnings on the sugar cane plantations during slavery . The original crop - over tradition began in 1687 as a way to mark the end of the yearly harvest , but was wide - spread throughout the region at the time , including in St. Vincent , Trinidad and Jamaica . As such , it still shares similarities with Carnival in Brazil and Trinidad . Many crop - over celebrations were organized and sponsored by planters , who used gifts of food and liquor as a means of reenforcing and excusing the continued enslavement of their labour force . However , slaves would also have often unsanctioned fetes that featured singing , dancing and accompaniment by bottles filled with water , shak - shak , banjo , triangle , fiddle , guitar , and bones that were more in keeping with their ancestral culture . Other traditions that were later added included climbing a greased pole , feasting and drinking competitions . However , with the harsh effects of World War II on Barbados , these annual celebrations came to an end . The Crop Over Festival was first launched on June 1 , 1970 , but was not officially called a festival until 4 years later .

Published in 1970 by Parents ' Magazine Press , the book tells the story of a penniless Army veteran , Benito Badoglio , who becomes rich after he unwittingly gains possession of a magic flying top hat . The book is richly illustrated and the text contains numerous vivid and mellifluous descriptions and dialog . For example , upon meeting the top hat , the protagonist cries , " Thunder of Sebastopole ! " ; in another scene , he shouts , " A thousand Potemkins ! " Other characters in the book are " cutthroats " , " brigands " , a " fainting contessa " , and a " dashing cadet " . The author 's interest in such colorful prose was explained by Selma G. Lanes in the Atlantic Monthly : " Ungerer feels strongly that children enjoy unfamiliar words and euphonious , mystifying phrases . " The setting for The Hat is nineteenth century Italy , and was described by Sydney D. Long in the Horn Book Magazine as " a never - never land ... , the comic - opera pictures of The Hat are full of mandolin - playing musicians , splashing fountains , and apple - cheeked peasant lasses .

                CONTEXT=The Immaculate Reception is one of the most famous plays in the history of American football . It occurred in the AFC divisional playoff game of the National Football League ( NFL ) , between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Oakland Raiders at Three Rivers Stadium in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , on December 23 , 1972 . With the Steelers trailing in the last 30 seconds of the game , Pittsburgh quarterback Terry Bradshaw threw a pass attempt to John Fuqua . The ball either bounced off the helmet of Raiders safety Jack Tatum or off the hands of Fuqua , and , as it fell , Steelers fullback Franco Harris scooped it up and ran for a game - winning touchdown . The play has been a source of unresolved controversy and speculation ever since , as many people have contended that the ball only touched Fuqua or that it hit the ground before Harris caught it , either of which would have resulted in an incomplete pass by the rules at the time . Kevin Cook 's The Last Headbangers cites the play as the beginning of a bitter rivalry between Pittsburgh and Oakland that fueled a historically brutal Raiders team during the NFL 's most controversially physical era .

On another aggregator website , Album of the Year , it holds the 4th position on a list of worst reviewed albums of 2014 . Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic gave the album 2.5 stars out of 5 saying that " Michele is not a natural pop star . This was true in 2009 when she debuted on '' Glee '' as Rachel Berry and it 's even clearer in 2014 . " Mike Ayers from '' Billboard '' gave a mostly positive review , saying , " Lyrically , '' Louder '' is rather one-sided , as she often sings about the perils of relationships , over and over , in ways that we 've all heard many times at this point . Still , it 's a solid effort that shows she has promise as a bonafide pop artist . " Sarah Rodman of '' The Boston Globe '' gave the album a mostly positive review , writing , " The Broadway veteran puts her mighty soprano through its paces on bouncy dance tracks , soaring ballads , and midtempo pop tunes where she straddles the line , mostly comfortably , between Katy Perry and Celine Dion . " Kyle Anderson of '' Entertainment Weekly '' gave the album a B - , writing , " It 's hard to be that mad at '' Louder '' , because it 's so admirably and lovingly crafted . There 's nothing wrong with Lea Michele 's debut , and that 's its biggest problem . While well curated and exquisitely executed , '' Louder '' is missing the visceral oomph that defines the gulf between superstars and the rest of the top 40 chum . " At '' USA Today '' , Jerry Shriver rated the album 2.5 stars out of four , and stated that " softer would have been a better approach . " He added that the song " Battlefield " points to a more promising direction . Kevin McFarland of '' The A.V. Club '' gave a C - rating , writing , " '' Louder '' , Michele 's debut solo album under her own name , does feature her distinctive talent as a vocalist . But the record is caught in an unfortunate stylistic limbo between fun-loving , youthful pop and the maturity of adult contemporary artists . " Jim Farber of the '' New York Daily News '' awarded the album two stars . He criticized , " Michele does n't so much sing as trumpet like an elephant eager for the charge . Her voice has more need than vulnerability , more anger than understanding . " Christopher R. Weingarten of '' Rolling Stone '' also gave a negative review , stating , " This album of insta-dated EDM-pop anthems and half-cocked bass drops probably wo n't help Michele 's cause . The songs about love 's ups and downs have a few memorable lyrics ( ' My heart 's too drunk to drive ' ) but not nearly enough .

" Also noting the eclectic mix of musical genres , '' The Ringer '' writes that " the bombastic tunes mix EDM gleams with stadium-rock grunts , chest-pounding ballads with peppy empowerment anthems , a thoroughly modern and disconcertingly eager post-genre assault designed to barnstorm as many Spotify playlists as possible . It 's a gilded cheese ball , pushing exhilaration to the point of exhaustion . " '' The Guardian '' wrote that the album brought " a whole lot of self-empowerment , enlivened with some deracinated R&B beats , and given the necessary gravitas by some power ballads of the sort that make one imagine the singer filmed from below with a wind machine blowing in their face . " Keala Settle performed " This Is Me " live on '' The Graham Norton Show '' on February 9 , 2018 . Later she performed on '' The Ellen DeGeneres Show '' on February 21 , 2018 .

                CONTEXT='' The Philadelphia Inquirer '' published a review by Carrie Rickey , who wrote , " Under the obvious influence of Francis Ford Coppola , Bouchareb frames his shadow-ridden guerrilla heroes as the Algerian counterparts of the Corleones " , referring to the American film '' The Godfather '' , and further that '' Outside the Law '' owes " an enormous debt to Jean-Pierre Melville 's '' Army of Shadows '' ( 1969 ) , about French resistance fighters one-minded in their goal to subvert Nazis " . Rickey wrote , " Bouchareb is sometimes a little too one-minded : His movie might have been richer emotionally had he written scenes showing the characters ' domestic lives and not strictly their professional spheres . " Stephen Holden of '' The New York Times '' called '' Outside the Law '' a " didactic , unashamedly manipulative film " , and also saw parallels to '' The Godfather '' and '' Army of Shadows '' : " Those are mighty shoes to fill , and as powerful and well-made as it is , '' Outside the Law '' is too schematic and single-minded to lodge itself in your mind as a fully realized cinematic epic . Its few female characters are sketchy at best . " Before the film premiered , already it was met by political controversy and nationalist-oriented criticism in France . Lionnel Luca , a member of the National Assembly for the UMP , appealed for a review by the Defence Historical Service as soon as he heard about the project . Guy Pervillé deplored the inevitable acceptance by moviegoers of the film as representing historical truth . The Defence Historical Service claimed that " the errors and anachronisms are so many and so gross that they can be identified by any historian ... The numerous improbabilities present in the scenario show that the writing of the latter was not preceded by a serious historical study . " The center of the controversy was the depiction of the 1945 Sétif massacre early in the film . The report elaborated , " The director wants to suggest that on May 8 , 1945 , Muslims in Sétif were blindly massacred by Europeans , whereas it 's the contrary that transpired . ... A ll historians agree that ... Europeans lashed out against Muslims in response to Muslims massacring Europeans . " This reaction is at odds with mainstream history , which concluded that , after restoring order in the town , French military and police then carried out a series of reprisals and summary executions of native civilians . Before even seeing the film , Luca also criticized the decision to give public funding to a film which he considered " anti-French " . Mustapha Orif , one of the film 's co-producers , responded to the accusations and defended the film 's portrayal of the massacre . " Rachid Bouchareb interviewed many people , witnesses and historians . From this point of view , I do not think at all that he has deviated from historical reality , " he said

                CONTEXT=The '' All Eyes on Sharon Tate '' documentary was used to publicize the film . Its 14 minutes consisted of a number of scenes depicting Tate filming '' Eye of the Devil '' , dancing in nightclubs , and sightseeing around London , and also contained a brief interview with her . Asked about her acting ambitions , she replied , " I do n't fool myself . I ca n't see myself doing Shakespeare . " She spoke of her hopes of finding a niche in comedy , and in other interviews she expressed her desire to become " a light comedienne in the Carole Lombard style " . She discussed the type of contemporary actress she wanted to emulate and explained that there were two in particular that she was influenced by : Faye Dunaway and Catherine Deneuve . Of the latter , she said , " I 'd like to be an American Catherine Deneuve . She plays beautiful , sensitive , deep parts with a little bit of intelligence behind them . " Later in the year , '' Valley of the Dolls '' opened to almost uniformly negative reviews . Bosley Crowther wrote in '' The New York Times '' , " all a fairly respectful admirer of movies can do is laugh at it and turn away " . '' Newsweek '' said that the film " has no more sense of its own ludicrousness than a village idiot stumbling in manure " , but a later article read : " Astoundingly photogenic , infinitely curvaceous , Sharon Tate is one of the most smashing young things to hit Hollywood in a long time . " The three lead actresses were castigated in numerous publications , including '' The Saturday Review '' , which wrote , " Ten years ago ... Parkins , Duke , and Tate would more likely have been playing the hat check girls than movie-queens ; they are totally lacking in style , authority , or charm . " '' The Hollywood Reporter '' provided some positive comments , such as , " Sharon Tate emerges as the film 's most sympathetic character ... William H. Daniels ' photographic caress of her faultless face and enormous absorbent eyes is stunning . " Roger Ebert of the '' Chicago Sun-Times '' praised Tate as " a wonder to behold " , but after describing the dialogue in one scene as " the most offensive and appalling vulgarity ever thrown up by any civilization " , concluded that , " I will be unable to take her any more seriously as a sex symbol than Raquel Welch . " In late 1967 , Tate and Polanski returned to London and were frequent subjects of newspaper and magazine articles . Tate was depicted as being untraditional and modern , and was quoted as saying couples should live together before marrying . They were married in Chelsea , London , on January 20 , 1968 , with considerable publicity . Polanski was dressed in what the press described as " Edwardian finery " , while Tate was attired in a white minidress . The couple moved into Polanski 's mews house off Eaton Square in Belgravia , London . Photographer Peter Evans later described them as " the imperfect couple . They were the Douglas Fairbanks/Mary Pickford of our time ... Cool , nomadic , talented , and nicely shocking . " While Tate reportedly wanted a traditional marriage , Polanski remained somewhat promiscuous and described Tate 's attitude to his infidelity as " Sharon 's big hang-up " . He reminded Tate that she had promised that she would not try to change him . Tate accepted Polanski 's conditions , though she confided to friends that she hoped he would change . Peter Evans quoted Tate as saying , " We have a good arrangement . Roman lies to me and I pretend to believe him . " Polanski urged Tate to end her association with Martin Ransohoff , and Tate began to place less importance on her career until Polanski told her he wanted to be married to " a hippie , not a housewife . " The couple returned to Los Angeles and quickly became part of a social group that included some of the most successful young people in the film industry , including Warren Beatty , Jacqueline Bisset , Leslie Caron , Joan Collins , Mia Farrow , Jane Fonda , Peter Fonda , Laurence Harvey , Steve McQueen , Joanna Pettet and Peter Sellers ; older film stars like Yul Brynner , Kirk Douglas , Henry Fonda and Danny Kaye ; musicians such as Jim Morrison and The Mamas & the Papas ; and record producer Terry Melcher and his girlfriend , actress Candice Bergen . Jay Sebring remained one of the couple 's more frequent companions . Polanski 's circle of friends included people he had known since his youth in Poland such as Wojciech Frykowski and Frykowski 's girlfriend , coffee heiress Abigail Folger . Tate and Polanski moved into the Chateau Marmont Hotel in Los Angeles for a few months until they arranged to lease Patty Duke 's home on Summit Ridge Drive in Beverly Hills during the latter part of 1968 . The Polanski house was often full of strangers , and Tate regarded the casual atmosphere as part of the " free spirit " of the times , saying that she did not mind who came into her home as her motto was " live and let live . " Her close friend Leslie Caron later commented that the Polanskis were too trusting — " to the point of recklessness " — and that she had been alarmed by it

                CONTEXT=Nambassa significantly expanded the concept of multiple open air staging , all running simultaneously at the one event . Out of the first 1978 three-day festival , the requirement of a second stage grew from the need to expand the entertainment program because of the resounding feedback from local performers and artists wanting to play at Nambassa . This became the " Aerial Railway " , a second fully operational stage with sound , lighting and management . Aerial Railway absorbed the overflow of performers from the Main Stage , and also acted as a venue for spontaneous performances or raves . This second option was integral to the Nambassa philosophy of promoting local music and arts . Although the Miami Pop Festival in December 1968 featured two simultaneous ' main ' stages , most of the early U.S. and European rock festivals , including Woodstock festival , Monterey Pop Festival and Isle of Wight Festival were predominantly single stage productions . The Nambassa 1978 festival had three stages ; 1979 saw this expanded to four ( including workshop stages ) , and the 1981 5-day celebration heralded five separate sound and lighting venues , all running at the same time . In 1981 , " Aerial Railway " was replaced with the " Open Air Theatre " and " Woozlebub " for children . The multiple staging concepts seem to be finally making a comeback in the 21st century as seen at the recent Big Day Out and Glastonbury festivals

                CONTEXT=Living Stage Theatre Company was a theatre for social change founded in 1966 by Robert A. Alexander ( 1929 – 2008 ) . He served as the artistic director until 1995 . Located in Washington , D.C. , this professional improvisational theater offered participatory workshops to children , youth , teachers , parents , and community members . Living Stage ’s main philosophy was based in the belief that every one is born an artist and the act of creation is the ultimate act of self - affirmation . The company 's mission was to transform individuals and communities through creative empowerment . The projects that the Living Stage put on typically dealt with controversial and sensitive topics like race , economic inequality , the dangers of an overzealous American foreign policy , the atom bomb , violence , and freedom . The " Baltimore Incident " of 1971 is an excellent example of how controversial these productions could be . No matter how mixed opinions were , the Living Stage always elicited a reaction with their improvisational performances . During the 1980s the Living Stage began to reach out extensively to local initiatives like The District 's Alcohol and Drug Abuse Services Administration and created their own Community Services Project in order to continue to bring theater and creativity to underserved sections of society . The Living Stage championed New Left ideals like equality and social justice throughout the Reagan years , despite some criticisms about their message being " anachronistic " . The Living Stage dissolved after 36 years and was a venture of Arena Stage .

It featured the singles " Crazy Little Thing Called Love " and " Another One Bites the Dust " , both of which reached number one in the US . After attending a Queen concert in Los Angeles , Michael Jackson suggested to Mercury backstage that " Another One Bites the Dust " be released as a single , and in October 1980 it spent three weeks at number one . The album topped the '' Billboard '' 200 for five weeks , and sold over four million copies in the US . It was also the first appearance of a synthesiser on a Queen album . Heretofore , their albums featured a distinctive " No Synthesisers ! " sleeve note . The note is widely assumed to reflect an anti-synth , pro- " hard " - rock stance by the band , but was later revealed by producer Roy Thomas Baker to be an attempt to clarify that those albums ' multi-layered solos were created with guitars , not synths , as record company executives kept assuming at the time . In September 1980 , Queen performed three sold-out shows at Madison Square Garden . In 1980 , Queen also released the soundtrack they had recorded for '' Flash Gordon '' . At the 1981 American Music Awards in January , " Another One Bites the Dust " won the award for Favorite Pop/Rock Single , and Queen were nominated for Favorite Pop/Rock Band , Duo , or Group

In 1920 he signed a contract with Erich Pommer , and during the 1920s his films took on a more fantastical slant , but he also directed melodramas and comedies .

The 1920s also saw Guter directing films with some of Germany 's most popular actors , including several films with Willy Fritsch : '' Blitzzug der Liebe '' ( 1925 ) , '' Die Boxerbraut '' ( 1926 ) and '' Der Tanzstudent '' ( 1928 ) . Despite his connection with the German film industry , Guter spent much of the 1920s living in Latvia , where he spent time attempting to build a Latvian film industry

                CONTEXT=The '' All Eyes on Sharon Tate '' documentary was used to publicize the film . Its 14 minutes consisted of a number of scenes depicting Tate filming '' Eye of the Devil '' , dancing in nightclubs , and sightseeing around London , and also contained a brief interview with her . Asked about her acting ambitions , she replied , " I do n't fool myself . I ca n't see myself doing Shakespeare . " She spoke of her hopes of finding a niche in comedy , and in other interviews she expressed her desire to become " a light comedienne in the Carole Lombard style " . She discussed the type of contemporary actress she wanted to emulate and explained that there were two in particular that she was influenced by : Faye Dunaway and Catherine Deneuve . Of the latter , she said , " I 'd like to be an American Catherine Deneuve . She plays beautiful , sensitive , deep parts with a little bit of intelligence behind them . " Later in the year , '' Valley of the Dolls '' opened to almost uniformly negative reviews . Bosley Crowther wrote in '' The New York Times '' , " all a fairly respectful admirer of movies can do is laugh at it and turn away " . '' Newsweek '' said that the film " has no more sense of its own ludicrousness than a village idiot stumbling in manure " , but a later article read : " Astoundingly photogenic , infinitely curvaceous , Sharon Tate is one of the most smashing young things to hit Hollywood in a long time . " The three lead actresses were castigated in numerous publications , including '' The Saturday Review '' , which wrote , " Ten years ago ... Parkins , Duke , and Tate would more likely have been playing the hat check girls than movie-queens ; they are totally lacking in style , authority , or charm . " '' The Hollywood Reporter '' provided some positive comments , such as , " Sharon Tate emerges as the film 's most sympathetic character ... William H. Daniels ' photographic caress of her faultless face and enormous absorbent eyes is stunning . " Roger Ebert of the '' Chicago Sun-Times '' praised Tate as " a wonder to behold " , but after describing the dialogue in one scene as " the most offensive and appalling vulgarity ever thrown up by any civilization " , concluded that , " I will be unable to take her any more seriously as a sex symbol than Raquel Welch . " In late 1967 , Tate and Polanski returned to London and were frequent subjects of newspaper and magazine articles . Tate was depicted as being untraditional and modern , and was quoted as saying couples should live together before marrying . They were married in Chelsea , London , on January 20 , 1968 , with considerable publicity . Polanski was dressed in what the press described as " Edwardian finery " , while Tate was attired in a white minidress . The couple moved into Polanski 's mews house off Eaton Square in Belgravia , London . Photographer Peter Evans later described them as " the imperfect couple . They were the Douglas Fairbanks/Mary Pickford of our time ... Cool , nomadic , talented , and nicely shocking . " While Tate reportedly wanted a traditional marriage , Polanski remained somewhat promiscuous and described Tate 's attitude to his infidelity as " Sharon 's big hang-up " . He reminded Tate that she had promised that she would not try to change him . Tate accepted Polanski 's conditions , though she confided to friends that she hoped he would change . Peter Evans quoted Tate as saying , " We have a good arrangement . Roman lies to me and I pretend to believe him . " Polanski urged Tate to end her association with Martin Ransohoff , and Tate began to place less importance on her career until Polanski told her he wanted to be married to " a hippie , not a housewife . " The couple returned to Los Angeles and quickly became part of a social group that included some of the most successful young people in the film industry , including Warren Beatty , Jacqueline Bisset , Leslie Caron , Joan Collins , Mia Farrow , Jane Fonda , Peter Fonda , Laurence Harvey , Steve McQueen , Joanna Pettet and Peter Sellers ; older film stars like Yul Brynner , Kirk Douglas , Henry Fonda and Danny Kaye ; musicians such as Jim Morrison and The Mamas & the Papas ; and record producer Terry Melcher and his girlfriend , actress Candice Bergen . Jay Sebring remained one of the couple 's more frequent companions . Polanski 's circle of friends included people he had known since his youth in Poland such as Wojciech Frykowski and Frykowski 's girlfriend , coffee heiress Abigail Folger . Tate and Polanski moved into the Chateau Marmont Hotel in Los Angeles for a few months until they arranged to lease Patty Duke 's home on Summit Ridge Drive in Beverly Hills during the latter part of 1968 . The Polanski house was often full of strangers , and Tate regarded the casual atmosphere as part of the " free spirit " of the times , saying that she did not mind who came into her home as her motto was " live and let live . " Her close friend Leslie Caron later commented that the Polanskis were too trusting — " to the point of recklessness " — and that she had been alarmed by it

He also questioned the purpose of the " Year of the Woman " theme writing , " The Oscar show itself seemed at odds with its own feminist theme . " Robert Bianco from the '' Pittsburgh Post-Gazette '' derided Allen 's musical production numbers , comparing them to the disastrous opening number at the 61st ceremony held in 1989 . Columnist Matt Roush of '' USA Today '' complained , " Crystal , in a by-now-familiar performance , has , in four years , taken a plum assignment and , by repetition , reduced it to shtick . " He also wrote that , " The song medley is getting old hat , " and the " smug references to his flop '' Mr. Saturday Night '' were out of an improv amateur night . " The telecast also received unfavorable reaction from various public feminist figures . In an interview with '' Los Angeles Daily News '' author and activist Betty Friedan condemned the " Year of the Woman " theme commenting , " It had no basis in reality . On behalf of women directors , cinematographer , and producers , I resent the travesty of calling that a tribute . " Likewise , President of the National Organization for Women 's Los Angeles chapter Tammy Bruce chastised ceremony 's feminist tribute as " one of the most hypocritical , patronizing things I saw in my whole life . " In response , Gil Cates responded towards the criticism of the theme stating , " The theme developed and raised consciousness in a way that I think is positive , not only for the individual in general but for individual women specifically . " He also quoted an ancient Chinese proverb later made famous by former U.S. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt saying , " It is better to light one candle than to curse the darkness " Despite the adverse reception , the ABC broadcast drew in an average of 45.7 million people over its length , which was a 3 % increase from the previous year 's ceremony . The show also drew higher Nielsen ratings compared to the previous ceremony with 31.2 % of households watching over a 51 share . It also drew a higher 18 – 49 demo rating with a 20.1 rating among viewers in that demographic

                CONTEXT=Betrayal is the secondary theme of '' The Wild Bunch '' . The characters suffer from their knowledge of having betrayed a friend and left him to his fate , thus violating their own honor code when it suits them ( " $ 10,000 cuts an awful lot of family ties " ) . However , Bishop says , " When you side with a man , you stay with him , and if you ca n't do that you 're like some animal . " Such oppositional ideas lead to the film 's violent conclusion , as the remaining men find their abandonment of Angel intolerable . Bishop remembers his betrayals , most notably when he deserts Deke Thornton ( in flashback ) when the law catches up to them and when he abandons Crazy Lee at the railroad office after the robbery ( ostensibly to guard the hostages ) . Critic David Weddle writes that , " like that of Conrad 's '' Lord Jim '' , Pike Bishop 's heroism is propelled by overwhelming guilt and a despairing death wish . " Vincent Canby began his review by calling the film " very beautiful and the first truly interesting American-made Western in years . It 's also so full of violence — of an intensity that can hardly be supported by the story — that it 's going to prompt a lot of people who do not know the real effect of movie violence ( as I do not ) to write automatic condemnations of it . " He observed , " Although the movie 's conventional and poetic action sequences are extraordinarily good and its landscapes beautifully photographed ... it is most interesting in its almost jolly account of chaos , corruption , and defeat " . About the actors , he commented particularly on William Holden : " After years of giving bored performances in boring movies , Holden comes back gallantly in '' The Wild Bunch '' . He looks older and tired , but he has style , both as a man and as a movie character who persists in doing what he 's always done , not because he really wants the money but because there 's simply nothing else to do . " '' TIME '' also liked Holden 's performance , describing it as his best since '' Stalag 17 '' ( a 1953 film that earned Holden an Oscar ) , noting Robert Ryan gave " the screen performance of his career " , and concluding that " '' The Wild Bunch '' contains faults and mistakes " ( such as flashbacks " introduced with surprising clumsiness " ) , but " its accomplishments are more than sufficient to confirm that Peckinpah , along with Stanley Kubrick and Arthur Penn , belongs with the best of the newer generation of American filmmakers . " In a 2002 retrospective Roger Ebert , who " saw the original version at the world premiere in 1969 , during the golden age of the junket , when Warner Bros. screened five of its new films in the Bahamas for 450 critics and reporters " , said that back then he had publicly declared the film a masterpiece during the junket 's press conference , prompted by comments from " a reporter from the '' Reader 's Digest '' who got up to ask ' Why was this film ever made ? ' " He compared the film to '' Pulp Fiction '' : " praised and condemned with equal vehemence . " " What '' Citizen Kane '' was to movie lovers in 1941 , '' The Wild Bunch '' was to cineastes in 1969 , " wrote film critic Michael Sragow , who added that Peckinpah had " produced an American movie that equals or surpasses the best of Kurosawa : the Gotterdammerung of Westerns "

The projects that the Living Stage put on typically dealt with controversial and sensitive topics like race , economic inequality , the dangers of an overzealous American foreign policy , the atom bomb , violence , and freedom . The " Baltimore Incident " of 1971 is an excellent example of how controversial these productions could be . No matter how mixed opinions were , the Living Stage always elicited a reaction with their improvisational performances . During the 1980s the Living Stage began to reach out extensively to local initiatives like The District 's Alcohol and Drug Abuse Services Administration and created their own Community Services Project in order to continue to bring theater and creativity to underserved sections of society . The Living Stage championed New Left ideals like equality and social justice throughout the Reagan years , despite some criticisms about their message being " anachronistic " . The Living Stage dissolved after 36 years and was a venture of Arena Stage .

                CONTEXT=The '' All Eyes on Sharon Tate '' documentary was used to publicize the film . Its 14 minutes consisted of a number of scenes depicting Tate filming '' Eye of the Devil '' , dancing in nightclubs , and sightseeing around London , and also contained a brief interview with her . Asked about her acting ambitions , she replied , " I do n't fool myself . I ca n't see myself doing Shakespeare . " She spoke of her hopes of finding a niche in comedy , and in other interviews she expressed her desire to become " a light comedienne in the Carole Lombard style " . She discussed the type of contemporary actress she wanted to emulate and explained that there were two in particular that she was influenced by : Faye Dunaway and Catherine Deneuve . Of the latter , she said , " I 'd like to be an American Catherine Deneuve . She plays beautiful , sensitive , deep parts with a little bit of intelligence behind them . " Later in the year , '' Valley of the Dolls '' opened to almost uniformly negative reviews . Bosley Crowther wrote in '' The New York Times '' , " all a fairly respectful admirer of movies can do is laugh at it and turn away " . '' Newsweek '' said that the film " has no more sense of its own ludicrousness than a village idiot stumbling in manure " , but a later article read : " Astoundingly photogenic , infinitely curvaceous , Sharon Tate is one of the most smashing young things to hit Hollywood in a long time . " The three lead actresses were castigated in numerous publications , including '' The Saturday Review '' , which wrote , " Ten years ago ... Parkins , Duke , and Tate would more likely have been playing the hat check girls than movie-queens ; they are totally lacking in style , authority , or charm . " '' The Hollywood Reporter '' provided some positive comments , such as , " Sharon Tate emerges as the film 's most sympathetic character ... William H. Daniels ' photographic caress of her faultless face and enormous absorbent eyes is stunning . " Roger Ebert of the '' Chicago Sun-Times '' praised Tate as " a wonder to behold " , but after describing the dialogue in one scene as " the most offensive and appalling vulgarity ever thrown up by any civilization " , concluded that , " I will be unable to take her any more seriously as a sex symbol than Raquel Welch . " In late 1967 , Tate and Polanski returned to London and were frequent subjects of newspaper and magazine articles . Tate was depicted as being untraditional and modern , and was quoted as saying couples should live together before marrying . They were married in Chelsea , London , on January 20 , 1968 , with considerable publicity . Polanski was dressed in what the press described as " Edwardian finery " , while Tate was attired in a white minidress . The couple moved into Polanski 's mews house off Eaton Square in Belgravia , London . Photographer Peter Evans later described them as " the imperfect couple . They were the Douglas Fairbanks/Mary Pickford of our time ... Cool , nomadic , talented , and nicely shocking . " While Tate reportedly wanted a traditional marriage , Polanski remained somewhat promiscuous and described Tate 's attitude to his infidelity as " Sharon 's big hang-up " . He reminded Tate that she had promised that she would not try to change him . Tate accepted Polanski 's conditions , though she confided to friends that she hoped he would change . Peter Evans quoted Tate as saying , " We have a good arrangement . Roman lies to me and I pretend to believe him . " Polanski urged Tate to end her association with Martin Ransohoff , and Tate began to place less importance on her career until Polanski told her he wanted to be married to " a hippie , not a housewife . " The couple returned to Los Angeles and quickly became part of a social group that included some of the most successful young people in the film industry , including Warren Beatty , Jacqueline Bisset , Leslie Caron , Joan Collins , Mia Farrow , Jane Fonda , Peter Fonda , Laurence Harvey , Steve McQueen , Joanna Pettet and Peter Sellers ; older film stars like Yul Brynner , Kirk Douglas , Henry Fonda and Danny Kaye ; musicians such as Jim Morrison and The Mamas & the Papas ; and record producer Terry Melcher and his girlfriend , actress Candice Bergen . Jay Sebring remained one of the couple 's more frequent companions . Polanski 's circle of friends included people he had known since his youth in Poland such as Wojciech Frykowski and Frykowski 's girlfriend , coffee heiress Abigail Folger . Tate and Polanski moved into the Chateau Marmont Hotel in Los Angeles for a few months until they arranged to lease Patty Duke 's home on Summit Ridge Drive in Beverly Hills during the latter part of 1968 . The Polanski house was often full of strangers , and Tate regarded the casual atmosphere as part of the " free spirit " of the times , saying that she did not mind who came into her home as her motto was " live and let live . " Her close friend Leslie Caron later commented that the Polanskis were too trusting — " to the point of recklessness " — and that she had been alarmed by it

It 's so totally confused and taking things from different parts . On one hand , if it wants to say something about a child 's - eye view of war , you got a movie made by John Boorman called '' Hope and Glory '' that was just released that is much better , and much more daring in showing the whimsy that children 's view of war is . On the other hand , this film wants to hedge its bet and make it like an adventure film , so you 've got like '' Indiana Jones '' with the John Malkovich character helping the little kid through all the fun of war . I do n't know what Spielberg wanted to do . " The film won awards from the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures for Best Film and Best Director , and Bale received a special citation for Best Performance by a Juvenile Actor , the first National Board award bestowed on a child actor .

He also questioned the purpose of the " Year of the Woman " theme writing , " The Oscar show itself seemed at odds with its own feminist theme . " Robert Bianco from the '' Pittsburgh Post-Gazette '' derided Allen 's musical production numbers , comparing them to the disastrous opening number at the 61st ceremony held in 1989 . Columnist Matt Roush of '' USA Today '' complained , " Crystal , in a by-now-familiar performance , has , in four years , taken a plum assignment and , by repetition , reduced it to shtick . " He also wrote that , " The song medley is getting old hat , " and the " smug references to his flop '' Mr. Saturday Night '' were out of an improv amateur night . " The telecast also received unfavorable reaction from various public feminist figures . In an interview with '' Los Angeles Daily News '' author and activist Betty Friedan condemned the " Year of the Woman " theme commenting , " It had no basis in reality . On behalf of women directors , cinematographer , and producers , I resent the travesty of calling that a tribute . " Likewise , President of the National Organization for Women 's Los Angeles chapter Tammy Bruce chastised ceremony 's feminist tribute as " one of the most hypocritical , patronizing things I saw in my whole life . " In response , Gil Cates responded towards the criticism of the theme stating , " The theme developed and raised consciousness in a way that I think is positive , not only for the individual in general but for individual women specifically . " He also quoted an ancient Chinese proverb later made famous by former U.S. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt saying , " It is better to light one candle than to curse the darkness " Despite the adverse reception , the ABC broadcast drew in an average of 45.7 million people over its length , which was a 3 % increase from the previous year 's ceremony . The show also drew higher Nielsen ratings compared to the previous ceremony with 31.2 % of households watching over a 51 share . It also drew a higher 18 – 49 demo rating with a 20.1 rating among viewers in that demographic

This was true in 2009 when she debuted on '' Glee '' as Rachel Berry and it 's even clearer in 2014 . " Mike Ayers from '' Billboard '' gave a mostly positive review , saying , " Lyrically , '' Louder '' is rather one-sided , as she often sings about the perils of relationships , over and over , in ways that we 've all heard many times at this point . Still , it 's a solid effort that shows she has promise as a bonafide pop artist . " Sarah Rodman of '' The Boston Globe '' gave the album a mostly positive review , writing , " The Broadway veteran puts her mighty soprano through its paces on bouncy dance tracks , soaring ballads , and midtempo pop tunes where she straddles the line , mostly comfortably , between Katy Perry and Celine Dion . " Kyle Anderson of '' Entertainment Weekly '' gave the album a B - , writing , " It 's hard to be that mad at '' Louder '' , because it 's so admirably and lovingly crafted . There 's nothing wrong with Lea Michele 's debut , and that 's its biggest problem . While well curated and exquisitely executed , '' Louder '' is missing the visceral oomph that defines the gulf between superstars and the rest of the top 40 chum . " At '' USA Today '' , Jerry Shriver rated the album 2.5 stars out of four , and stated that " softer would have been a better approach . " He added that the song " Battlefield " points to a more promising direction . Kevin McFarland of '' The A.V. Club '' gave a C - rating , writing , " '' Louder '' , Michele 's debut solo album under her own name , does feature her distinctive talent as a vocalist . But the record is caught in an unfortunate stylistic limbo between fun-loving , youthful pop and the maturity of adult contemporary artists . " Jim Farber of the '' New York Daily News '' awarded the album two stars . He criticized , " Michele does n't so much sing as trumpet like an elephant eager for the charge . Her voice has more need than vulnerability , more anger than understanding . " Christopher R. Weingarten of '' Rolling Stone '' also gave a negative review , stating , " This album of insta-dated EDM-pop anthems and half-cocked bass drops probably wo n't help Michele 's cause . The songs about love 's ups and downs have a few memorable lyrics ( ' My heart 's too drunk to drive ' ) but not nearly enough .

It 's so totally confused and taking things from different parts . On one hand , if it wants to say something about a child 's - eye view of war , you got a movie made by John Boorman called '' Hope and Glory '' that was just released that is much better , and much more daring in showing the whimsy that children 's view of war is . On the other hand , this film wants to hedge its bet and make it like an adventure film , so you 've got like '' Indiana Jones '' with the John Malkovich character helping the little kid through all the fun of war . I do n't know what Spielberg wanted to do . " The film won awards from the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures for Best Film and Best Director , and Bale received a special citation for Best Performance by a Juvenile Actor , the first National Board award bestowed on a child actor .

Allen Daviau , who was nominated as cinematographer , publicly complained , " I ca n't second-guess the Academy , but I feel very sorry that I get nominations and Steven does n't . It 's his vision that makes it all come together , and if Steven was n't making these films , none of us would be here . " The film won awards for cinematography , sound design , and music score at the 42nd British Academy Film Awards .

Spielberg was honored for this work by the Directors Guild of America , while the American Society of Cinematographers honored Allen Daviau .
