In Late 2002 , top al-Qaeda operative Abu Zubaydah was arrested while being sheltered by Lashkar-e-Taiba in a safe house in Faisalabad . The FBI believes that al-Qaeda and Lashkar have been ' intertwined ' for a long time while the CIA has said that al-Qaeda funds Lashkar-e-Taiba . Jean-Louis Bruguière told Reuters in 2009 that " Lashkar-e-Taiba is no longer a Pakistani movement with only a Kashmir political or military agenda . Lashkar-e-Taiba is a member of al-Qaeda . " In a video released in 2008 , American-born senior al-Qaeda operative Adam Yahiye Gadahn stated that " victory in Kashmir has been delayed for years ; it is the liberation of the jihad there from this interference which , Allah willing , will be the first step towards victory over the Hindu occupiers of that Islam land . " In September 2009 , a US drone strike reportedly killed Ilyas Kashmiri who was the chief of Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami , a Kashmiri militant group associated with al-Qaeda . Kashmiri was described by Bruce Riedel as a ' prominent ' al-Qaeda member while others have described him as head of military operations for al-Qaeda . Kashmiri was also charged by the US in a plot against Jyllands-Posten , the Danish newspaper which was at the center of Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy . US officials also believe that Kashmiri was involved in the Camp Chapman attack against the CIA . In January 2010 , Indian authorities notified Britain of an al-Qaeda plot to hijack an Indian airlines or Air India plane and crash it into a British city . This information was uncovered from interrogation of Amjad Khwaja , an operative of Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami , who had been arrested in India

		CONTEXT=Since the early 2000s , Sinai has been the site of several terror attacks against tourists , the majority of whom are Egyptian . Investigations have shown that these were mainly motivated by a resentment of the poverty faced by many Bedouin in the area . Attacking the tourist industry was viewed as a method of damaging the industry so that the government would pay more attention to their situation . ( See 2004 Sinai bombings , 2005 Sharm El Sheikh bombings and 2006 Dahab bombings ) . Since the 2011 Egyptian Revolution , unrest has become more prevalent in the area including the 2012 Egyptian-Israeli border attack in which 16 Egyptian soldiers were killed by militants . ( See Sinai insurgency . ) Also on the rise are kidnappings of refugees . According to Meron Estifanos , Eritrean refugees are often kidnapped by Bedouin in the northern Sinai , tortured , raped , and only released after receiving a large ransom

		CONTEXT=Having noticed the advantages of the combination of social media and Phoneography , some well-known newspapers , news magazines and professional photojournalists decided to employ iPhone journalism as a new approach . When the London Bombings happened in July 2005 , for the first time , both the '' New York Times '' and the '' Washington Post '' ran photos on their front pages made by citizen journalists with camera phones . As work of witnesses and survivors , the images were less the outcome of documentary intent than a response to a traumatic shock . These photos represented ' vivid , factual accounts of history as it explodes around us ' , as described by '' Washington Post '' journalist Robert MacMillan . In another instance , when superstorm Sandy hit the East Coast , causing great damage and casualty , Time sent out five photographers with iPhones to document the devastation . Photographers dived deep into the site and captured pictures in close proximity to the storm and human suffering . One of the shots , raging ocean waves collapsing on Coney Island in Brooklyn , taken by Benjamin Lowy , made the cover of Time 's November 12 issue . Then in 2013 , the Chicago Sun-Times got rid of its entire staff of 28 photographers , including John H. White , a Pulitzer Prize winner in photography . The newspaper cited viewers shifting towards more video as a reason . They then employed freelance photographers and required them to train in how to use an iPhone for photography to fill the gap .

		ANSWER=2004 general elections
		GOLD_MENTION=
		CONTEXT=The 2004 general elections defied the predictions made by pre-poll predictions and exit polls and allowed the newly formed UPA alliance led by Sonia Gandhi , to come to power . This election also saw the rise of marginalized parties like the left , to join forces with the opposition , which led to a major realignment in social and political power . Though pre-poll predictions were for an overwhelming majority for the BJP , the exit polls ( immediately after the elections and before the counting began ) predicted a hung parliament . However , even the exit polls could only indicate the general trend and nowhere close to the final figures . There is also the general perception that as soon as the BJP started realising that events might not proceed entirely in its favour , it changed the focus of its campaign from India Shining to issues of stability . The Congress , who was regarded as " old - fashioned " by the ruling BJP , was largely backed by poor , rural , lower - caste and minority voters that did not participate in the economic boom of previous years that created a large wealthy middle class and thus achieved its overwhelming victory . The reverses in the pre-poll predictions are ascribed to various reasons depending on the point of view .

You 're showing your tits and he 's not showing his ass . ' But is n't it the people who are hiding women behind layers of clothes who are the misogynists ? I 'm a real person , so it 's a statement to say , ' Alright , I 'm a forty year-old woman , and this is what you get with no plastic surgery . ' '' Lolo '' was Delpy 's second French-language feature film . It was also the first film she directed since '' 2 Days in New York '' .

He took the lead in establishing the European concert during the Armenian massacres of 1896 , and again resisted isolated action on the part of any of the great powers during the Cretan troubles and the Greco-Turkish War . In November 1897 , when the Austro-Hungarian flag was insulted at Mersina , he threatened to bombard the town if instant reparation were not made , and by his firm attitude greatly enhanced Austrian prestige in the East . In his speech to the delegations in 1898 he dwelt on the necessity of expanding Austria 's mercantile marine , and of raising the fleet to a strength which , while not vying with the fleets of the great naval powers , would ensure respect for the Austrian flag wherever her interests needed protection . He also hinted at the necessity for European combination to resist American competition

		CONTEXT=Perhaps the best known appearance of Cephalonia in popular culture is in the novel '' Captain Corelli 's Mandolin '' , by the English author Louis de Bernières .

During filming there was lively debate between the production team , local authorities as well as groups of citizens , as to the complex historical details of the island 's antifascist resistance . As a result , political references were omitted from the film , and the romantic core of the book was preserved , without entering complex debates about the island 's history . In 2005 , Riccardo Milani made his TV movie , '' Cefalonia '' , also about the massacre , with music by Ennio Morricone

		CONTEXT=Critical opinion regarding the film has been overwhelmingly positive . '' The Village Voice '' critic J. Hoberman , who in 1981 included the film in his list of the ten best films commercially released in the United States during that year , more recently wrote that the film is one " of the richest avant-garde features of the 1970s " and praised its " winning combination of sexual frankness and visual wit , " while another critic , Dennis Schwartz , wrote that the " film 's beauty is derived from its sexual frankness and playfully drawn out intimate relationship scenes , witty use of photography , and its originality as it breaks free of conventional unities of body , space and time . Export skillfully edits montage and integrates video , still photography , and performance art with elements from Cubism , Surrealism , Dada and avant-garde cinema . " '' Artforum '' noted in November 1980 that " w atching their scenes together , we realize how seldom , if ever before , the details of sexual intimacy have been shown in film from the point of view from a woman . Export privileges rupture over unity and never settles for one-dimensional solutions " and it was called one " of the most original films in this year 's exposition " and a " tour de force of cinematic invention " grounded in the director 's " fresh and intelligent sensibility , characteristically self-referential . Her visual resources include mirrors , still photography , video , dance , and films within the film , all employed with a bold and surprising inventiveness " by the catalogue notes of the 1978 Los Angeles International Film Exposition . Similarly , critic Alison Butler wrote that the " film is a witty and visually brilliant essay on gender and experience , culture and environment " and program notes used by the San Francisco Cinematheque during a screening quote critic Amy Taubin as opining that the film " makes you reconsider what you and everyone else is doing — in life and in art " and critic Steve Anker underscoring that it is an important " crossover film " combining " avant-garde and theatrical sensibilities , made during the mid-1970s . It chronicles the nightmarish breakdown of a fashion photographer as she confronts her waning identity and security as a career woman ; blending narrative experimentation , fantasy , fact and theoretical critique , it has enormous impact on independent features which followed it . " PopMatters noted that the film has " enough originality to nag at patient viewers and get at least partially under our skin " and critic Michael Atkinson wrote that it is a " weird , restless , beguilingly offbeat bit of dreamwork . " The film was presented for the first time at the Berlin International Film Festival in 1977 , it has won a Special Jury Prize at the Venice Film Festival and was recently called " seminal " during a screening at a repertory cinema , " a strong and humoristic showdown " at another and " a sonically-complex , montage-rich , darkly funny and uriniferous cornerstone of avant-garde cinema " during a screening at a New York University class . Critic Peter Hajek wrote in the Austrian newspaper '' Kurier '' that " Valie Export presents this psychopanoptic view of the present in solid , striking images and often in unexpected humorous passages . " Critic Chris Holmlund , author of the scholarly article " Feminist Makeovers : The Celluloid Surgery of Valie Export and Su Friedrich , " referred to '' Invisible Adversaries '' as a feminist version of '' Invasion of the Body Snatchers '' , noted that the film includes references to famous paintings and to '' Un Chien Andalou '' , and wrote that therefore it " is visually rick , entertaining , striking , but also demanding . " A few reviews , however , were negative . For example , London 's '' Time Out '' wrote about the film that it is " n ot unlike '' W.R. : Mysteries of the Organism '' " and that it will " probably age as badly " and a reviewer for '' The Heights '' wrote that " I was expecting a great feminist work here , but got mediocrity . I can not recommend that you see this film , " though he nevertheless praised the film as a " cornucopia of video spectacle in which Export delights , confounds and amuses the audience with her antics .

		CONTEXT=The pattern of displacement along the Imperial Fault was very similar to that observed for the northern part of the rupture during the 1940 El Centro earthquake , although on this occasion the rupture did not extend across the border into Mexico . This had been explained as the behavior of individual slip patches along the Imperial Fault with two patches rupturing in 1940 and only the northern one in 1979 . The faulting that gave rise to the earthquake has been modeled by comparing synthetic seismograms with near-source strong motion recordings . This analysis showed that the rupture speed had at times exceeded the shear wave velocity , making this the first earthquake for which supershear rupture was inferred

In previous years , countries that received a top 10 placing were automatically granted a spot in the next year 's final without having to compete in a semi-final , but for 2008 , the EBU changed the automatic qualification regulations so that all countries except the " Big 4 " ( France , Germany , Spain , and the United Kingdom ) and host country , would have to pass through one of two semi-finals . The EBU split up countries with a friendly voting history into separate semi-finals , to give a better chance for other countries to win . Greece and Cyprus had often been accused of favoring each other , with each awarding the other the maximum number of points ( twelve ) at the previous contest . On January 28 , 2008 , the EBU held a special draw which determined that Greece would be in '' Semi-final 1 '' held on May 20 , 2008 in Belgrade , Serbia ; Cyprus was subsequently placed in the second semi-final

		CONTEXT=The 2003 Istanbul bombings provide the strongest implication of ties between IBDA-C and al-Qaeda , although the exact nature of their cooperation remains unclear . Al-Qaeda may have acted merely as an outside support base , or possibly in tandem with IBDA-C in terms of planning and execution . Some , on the other hand , assert that IBDA-C had no involvement at all ; contradicting reports from the Turkish media solely credit al-Qaeda with the attacks , implying that IBDA-C did not have the means to carry out such a sophisticated act of terrorism . Indeed , IBDA-C showed no willingness to exercise suicide terrorism prior to November 2003 . Regardless of whether or not IBDA-C actively participated in these particular attacks , the attention received provided the group with a heightened level of international infamy , as they were previously not well known at the global level

		CONTEXT=The music video for " Chandelier " was released on 6 May 2014 , featuring then-11-year-old dancer Maddie Ziegler . In the video , Ziegler wears a medium-length blonde wig matching the one that Sia used to promote the album .

An alternative one-take version of the clip was released in June 2014 . Sia had seen Ziegler on '' Dance Moms '' and asked her to appear in the video via Twitter . The video was directed by Sia and Daniel Askill , shot by cinematographer Sebastian Winterø and was choreographed by Ryan Heffington . Ziegler shared her thoughts about the choreography with '' New York '' magazine : I like the whole dance . It was really different and weird for me , because I usually do n't , you know , be a crazy person every time . It was so fun to do and it was really out of the box and it expanded me a lot , because I 'm used to competition dances where you 're like , " Point your legs ! " But this time it was like , you just need to let go and feel it . The choreography was praised by media outlets ; an editor from '' The Guardian '' wrote that Ziegler " dances with such impressive flexibility " . Nolan Feenay from '' Time '' magazine commented that the dance moves in the video could be the best dance routine of 2014 . " Chandelier " received nominations at the MTV Video Music Awards for Video of the Year and Best Choreography , and ultimately won the latter .

When a guard finally grabbed him , Shafrazi shouted , " Call the curator . I am an artist . " The paint was easily removed as the painting was heavily varnished . It is believed that Shafrazi was protesting the announcement , the day before , of the release on bail of U.S. lieutenant William Calley . Calley , then under house arrest following his conviction , in 1971 , for his part in the My Lai massacre in Vietnam , had petitioned for habeas corpus ; he had initially been sentenced to life imprisonment . Although his appeal was overturned in June , he was finally released from U.S. Army custody later in the year after having received a limited pardon from Richard Nixon . Shafrazi was a member of the Art Workers ' Coalition , which in 1970 had staged a protest at MoMA by unfurling a copy of the famous My Lai protest poster '' And babies '' in front of the '' Guernica '' painting , which itself depicts the tragedies of war and the suffering it inflicts upon innocent civilians .

		CONTEXT=The Germans now took over the Italian zone , and soon proved to be a totally different opponent from the demoralized , war-weary and far less brutal Italians . Already since the early summer of 1943 , German troops had been pouring into Greece , fearing an Allied landing there ( in fact falling victims to a grand-scale Allied strategic deception operation , " Operation Barclay " ) . Soon they became involved in wide-ranging counterguerrilla operations , which they carried out with great ruthlessness , based on their experiences in Yugoslavia . In the course of these operations , mass reprisals were carried out , resulting in war crimes such as at Kommeno on August 16 , the Massacre of Kalavryta in December and the Massacre of Distomo in June 1944 . At the same time , hundreds of villages were systematically torched and almost one million people left homeless

		GOLD_MENTION=Distomo massacre
		CONTEXT=Operation Steinadler ( 3 – 13 July 1944 ) was the last counter-insurgency operation carried out by German forces in Macedonia . Although wide in its scope it ultimately failed to achieve its objectives as ELAS fighters successfully evaded the German patrols , returning to their hideouts once the operation was over . The civilian population thus became the main target for Axis reprisals . Shortly afterwards the German 1st Mountain Division and the 4th SS Polizei Panzergrenadier Division departed from the country , while in August Army Group E declared Greece a war zone . German shops and cultural institutions were closed , while civilians and older member of the army , secret police and SS were evacuated . Under Adolf Hitler 's orders the Wehrmacht adopted the policy of total war , in response to the rise of ELAS subversive activity which had hampered the summer harvest in areas still controlled by the collaborationist government . Army Group E 's staff deemed the preceding Distomo massacre and 1 May 1944 Kaisariani executions as excessive and even damaging to the image of the occupational authorities . The staff stressed the need to arrest insurgents rather than resorting to the collective punishment of civilians . Nevertheless , those orders were disregarded and atrocities continued unhindered . Between June and August , ELAS attacks led to the death of 30 German soldiers , 14 were wounded and 9 more were missing in action . German reprisals in their turn included the execution of 254 people

		ANSWER=Montreal massacre
		GOLD_MENTION=Montreal massacre
		CONTEXT=Adam Thrasher argued that the " Take Back the Night " marches cause polarization in gender relations , since women discourage men from participating . Thrasher said , as paraphrased by Dan Lazin of '' The Gateway '' , that " unthinking men may be incited to further hatred towards women . " Thrasher argued that while the strips criticize " the ideas of some hard-core feminists , " they are not against all women . Thrasher added that " The reason I did it is because it 's such a taboo to make fun of violence against women , against Take Back the Night . " Thrasher also stated that " When I drew up the cartoon , I was n't thinking about Marc Lepine and the Montreal massacre which was a crime against humanity , I think , more than a crime against women . " A Saturday October 25 , 1997 , editorial of '' The Globe and Mail '' argued that the actions against Thrasher were censorship and that " the instinct to block the juvenile humour was more disturbing than the juvenalia itself . " The '' Alberta Report '' said in 1997 that " '' Space Moose '' is a festival of caricatured scatology , violence , perversion , irreligion and even pedophilia . It has stimulated outrage before , but in five years the university had never suppressed the strip , despite lampoons of University institutions , Trekkies , the mentally retarded , and Christians . Only one group , it seems , has the clout to make the university turn censor . " In response to Thrasher 's argument that the marches could polarize gender relations and that the comic had a different message than perceived , Gretchen Hess said that the intent of the strip was not easily discernible and that the effect of the strip should be considered in addition to the intent . Linda Trimble argued that " t he pretty direct message of the cartoon was ' It 's open season on feminists . Kill all the women . " Joyce Green , a University of Regina political science professor who was another complainant , argued that " I do n't see any difference between the Montreal Massacre and the cartoon . " Green added that the group had complained about the strips " not because we 're paranoid but because we 're terrified . " Shannon Sampert , a political science student who was another one of the complainants , said that she was not surprised that the appeal went in favor of Thrasher . She believed that additional students would try to take the course of action that Thrasher took , and she believed that Feminists would cause an outcry against the appeals

Janet Maslin of '' The New York Times '' wrote : " A seemingly fluffy book suddenly touches base with vicious reality , in ways that may give '' Big Little Lies '' even more staying power than '' The Husband 's Secret '' Moriarty 's previous book . " Roberta Bernstein of '' USA Today '' gave it three stars out of four , deeming it " a fun , engaging and sometimes disturbing read , even if the characters are more conceits than flesh and blood . " Leah Greenblatt of '' Entertainment Weekly '' gave it an A and noted that , while the book fell in the " chick-lit " category , Moriarty still offered " insights that are n’t any less wise or funny or true just because she sometimes likes a champagne metaphor or hangs her story on a shoe . " Carol Memmott of '' The Washington Post '' wrote , " It takes a powerful stand against domestic violence even as it makes us laugh at the adults whose silly costume party seems more reminiscent of a middle-school dance . " A television mini-series adaptation of the novel was produced by HBO titled '' Big Little Lies '' , filmed on location in Monterey , California .

		CONTEXT=The ceremony was held on a night other than Sunday for the first time since 1976 ( the 28th Primetime Emmy Awards were also staged on a Monday that year , May 17 ) . The ceremony 's unusual date — a Monday night in late August — was due to two factors , primary being NBC 's commitment to '' Sunday Night Football '' ; since acquiring the National Football League 's Sunday night game package in 2006 , NBC , when it is their turn in the four-network rotation to air the Primetime Emmy Awards , usually schedules the ceremony for the Sunday before Labor Day weekend , to avoid conflicts with '' SNF '' in mid-September ( when ABC , CBS , or Fox normally air the ceremony ) . NBC 's ideal date on the 2014 calendar for the ceremony ( Sunday , August 24 ) led to the other scheduling factor — MTV 's Video Music Awards , which were set for that night more than a year in advance ( and would be staged in the L.A. area as well , at The Forum in Inglewood ) . On January 28 , 2014 , rather than go head-to-head with the VMA 's , NBC announced that the ceremony would take place on Monday , August 25 . The move would allow NBC to commit to a preseason '' Sunday Night Football '' broadcast for the 24th ( a game between the Cincinnati Bengals and Arizona Cardinals ) ; it also ensured the tradition of staging the Primetime Emmy Awards the weekend after the Creative Arts Emmy Awards ( that ceremony was already set for August 16 )

NBC 's ideal date on the 2014 calendar for the ceremony ( Sunday , August 24 ) led to the other scheduling factor — MTV 's Video Music Awards , which were set for that night more than a year in advance ( and would be staged in the L.A. area as well , at The Forum in Inglewood ) . On January 28 , 2014 , rather than go head-to-head with the VMA 's , NBC announced that the ceremony would take place on Monday , August 25 . The move would allow NBC to commit to a preseason '' Sunday Night Football '' broadcast for the 24th ( a game between the Cincinnati Bengals and Arizona Cardinals ) ; it also ensured the tradition of staging the Primetime Emmy Awards the weekend after the Creative Arts Emmy Awards ( that ceremony was already set for August 16 )

The outbreak produced the largest 24 - hour total of killer tornadoes until the 1974 Super Outbreak on April 3 – 4 . The precise number of tornadoes as well as fatalities incurred during the outbreak is unknown , but the death toll was variously estimated to range from 370 – 2,000 at the time . A reliable survey by the Signal Corps in 1889 located 182 fatalities , and a reanalysis by tornado researcher Thomas P. Grazulis in 1993 counted 178 deaths . Nonetheless , an inspection of newspaper reports and governmental studies published in the aftermath reveals successive , long - tracked tornado families striking Alabama , Georgia , Illinois , Indiana , Kentucky , Mississippi , North Carolina , South Carolina , Tennessee and Virginia , with an estimation of at least 37 tornadoes .

The Last Train to India restaurant at 94 Cashel Street was a graphic example of the damage caused . The wall of the adjacent former Zetland Hotel collapsed and crashed through the roof ; anybody standing in the restaurant 's bar area would likely have been killed , but it was still closed that morning

Despite these struggles , his on-field development was such that he would still debut in the 2010 season 's opening match , a 56-point Richmond loss against at the MCG . Martin recorded the sixth most disposals of any Tiger ( 18 ) to go along with four marks , three tackles and three clearances . Two weeks later Martin was convicted by the AFL tribunal for a high hit on Sydney 's Josh Kennedy in round 3 . He did not receive a suspension for the incident however , returning to football the following week . After four matches Martin ranked fourth in the league for clearances and eighth for hard-ball gets . Media reports emerged after round 8 that the 18 year old Martin had received a significant contract offer from expansion club the Greater Western Sydney Giants . The offer , which the Herald Sun ’s Mark Robinson claimed to be worth $ 2.4 million over three seasons , would have taken effect in the new club 's first AFL season in 2012 . Martin later said he had never entertained the idea of moving to the start-up club . In round 10 he had gained attention for his on-field efforts again , this time being nominated for the 2010 AFL Rising Star award after a 21 disposal and 11 clearance match against Port Adelaide . Due to his previous tribunal conviction however , Martin was ruled ineligible for the award and thus did not officially place in the end of season award 's points tally . He drew the attention of Sydney coach Paul Roos by round 14 , prompting Roos to send veteran Brett Kirk onto Martin in a tagging role . Despite this extra attention , he still managed to record 18 disposals and a goal in the match at the MCG . After 17 rounds Martin ranked second at the club for clearances and inside 50s as well as third for disposals and contested possessions . At the same time he ranked first among that season 's Rising Star nominees in clearances , contested possessions and inside 50s . He was also fourth for average disposals and fifth for average tackles . In round 19 he was rested by the club before returning to play out the final five matches of the season . He missed just that one game in his debut season and finished the year ranked second at Richmond for clearances and inside 50s , as well as third for both contested possessions and disposals . In addition to winning the Fred Swift Medal for fourth place at the club 's best and fairest night , Martin also received six votes in the Brownlow Medal count that year , the most by any Richmond debutant since Craig Lambert in 1988 . At season 's end he reiterated his commitment to the club ( and rejection of the former GWS overtures ) by signing a two-year contract extension that would keep him at Richmond until the end of the 2013 season . The extension was reported by the Herald Sun to be in the vicinity of $ 400,000-a-year

		ANSWER=US tour
		GOLD_MENTION=US tour in August
		CONTEXT=The publication in the US of Lennon 's remarks about the Beatles being " more popular than Jesus " then embroiled the band in controversy and protest in America 's Bible Belt . A public apology eased tensions , but a US tour in August that was marked by reduced ticket sales , relative to the group 's record attendances in 1965 , and subpar performances proved to be their last . The author Nicholas Schaffner writes : On the Beatles ' return to England , rumours began to circulate that they had decided to break up . George Harrison informed Epstein that he was leaving the band , but was persuaded to stay on the assurance that there would be no more tours . The group took a three-month break , during which they focused on individual interests . Harrison travelled to India for six weeks to study the sitar under the instruction of Ravi Shankar and develop his interest in Hindu philosophy . Having been the last of the Beatles to concede that their live performances had become futile , Paul McCartney collaborated with Beatles producer George Martin on the soundtrack for the film '' The Family Way '' and holidayed in Kenya with Mal Evans , one of the Beatles ' tour managers . Lennon acted in the film '' How I Won the War '' and attended art showings , such as one at the Indica Gallery where he met his future wife Yoko Ono . Ringo Starr used the break to spend time with his wife Maureen and son Zak

		CONTEXT=Akhiok is an Alutiiq village dependent upon fishing and subsistence activities . The original village of Kashukugniut was occupied by Russians in the early 19th century . The community was originally a sea otter hunting settlement , located at Humpy Cove . The name Akhiok was reported in the 1880 census . In 1881 , residents relocated to the present site at Alitak Bay . The relocation was , in part , based on the switch to a fishing economy . Most families gain their livelihood from fishing , either directly by fishing for salmon and halibut or by working in a nearby cannery . The community 's Russian Orthodox church , Protection of the Theotokos Chapel , was built around 1900 at the site of an earlier structure . A post office was established in 1933 . Residents of nearby Kaguyak relocated to Akhiok after the 1964 earthquake and tsunami destroyed their village . The city was incorporated in 1972

		CONTEXT=Following the 1976 Tangshan earthquake , the ROC mobilized the FCRA to organize disaster relief operations in the areas of Beijing , Tianjin and Tangshan . The FCRA collaborated with the Bank of Taiwan to provide a large quantity of donated humanitarian aid and food items from the people of Taiwan and organized bulk shipments via the International Red Cross to be distributed in the mainland . Beijing refused the aid shipments and the FCRA decided to launch the aid parcels directly to the mainland using unmanned balloons in collaboration with the Ministry of National Defense . These actions apparently triggered the scrambling of MiG interceptors tasked with shooting down the balloons . ROC Ambassador to the U.S. James Shen confirmed ROC actions to provide mainland disaster relief : Taiwan 's furious response to the mainland 's refusal to accept the aid was a powerful piece of political drama at the time , serving its interests at home and abroad

		CONTEXT=Carmelite and the children returned to the Beloit for the period from 1888 to 1890 for the children 's education and then returned to Turkey . In 1893 the family moved to Tarsus to take up a post at St. Paul 's College . Carmelite by character and situation assumed non-traditional roles overseas . As part of his duties , Thomas left Turkey to raise money or went to surrounding mission stations to support them . In addition to her family responsibilities , she was involved in the activities of St. Paul 's College and the education of women and a supporter of suffrage for unmarried women . After the 1895 massacre at Marash , Carmelite wrote letters describing the events which were published in American newspapers . She reported on deaths , woundings , damage to the schools in Marash and threats to the missionary workers . Her reports were personal , having spent fifteen years among those who were living through the crisis and in one letter , she reported that she and her husband had been warned regarding violence which might spread to Tarsus . By August , the rioting had reached them , though the Christies were not at the school when it was looted . In the face of the ongoing violence , the family fled to Mersina , and eventually Carmelite returned with the children to the United States between 1897 and 1898 for their safety and schooling

		ANSWER=Mussel Slough Tragedy
		GOLD_MENTION=
		CONTEXT=The Mussel Slough Tragedy was a dispute over land titles between settlers and the Southern Pacific Railroad ( SP ) that took place on May 11 , 1880 , on a farm located northwest of Hanford , California , in the central San Joaquin Valley , leaving seven people dead . Frank Norris ' 1901 novel , The Octopus : A Story of California , was inspired by this incident , as was W. C. Morrow 's 1882 novel Blood - Money . May Merrill Miller 's novel , First the Blade , includes a fictionalized account of the conflict . The exact history of the incident has been the source of some disagreement , largely because popular anti-railroad sentiment in the 1880s interpreted the incident as a clear example of corrupt and cold - blooded corporate greed . Muckraking journalists and anti-railroad activists glorified the settlers and used the events as evidence and justification for their anti-corporate crusades .

		GOLD_MENTION=1976 Tangshan earthquake
		CONTEXT=Following the 1976 Tangshan earthquake , the ROC mobilized the FCRA to organize disaster relief operations in the areas of Beijing , Tianjin and Tangshan . The FCRA collaborated with the Bank of Taiwan to provide a large quantity of donated humanitarian aid and food items from the people of Taiwan and organized bulk shipments via the International Red Cross to be distributed in the mainland . Beijing refused the aid shipments and the FCRA decided to launch the aid parcels directly to the mainland using unmanned balloons in collaboration with the Ministry of National Defense . These actions apparently triggered the scrambling of MiG interceptors tasked with shooting down the balloons . ROC Ambassador to the U.S. James Shen confirmed ROC actions to provide mainland disaster relief : Taiwan 's furious response to the mainland 's refusal to accept the aid was a powerful piece of political drama at the time , serving its interests at home and abroad

		CONTEXT=Northwestern University Woman ’s Medical School is a defunct American medical school for the professional education of women . Located in Chicago , Illinois , it was organized in 1870 as the Woman 's Hospital Medical College of Chicago , and it was in close connection with the Chicago Hospital for Women and Children .

Co-education of the sexes , in medicine and surgery , was experimentally tried from 1868 to 1870 , but the experiment proved repugnant to the male students , who unanimously signed a protest against the continuance of the system . The result was the establishment of a separate school for women in 1870 , with a faculty of sixteen professors . The requirements for graduation were fixed at four years of medical study , including three annual graded college terms of six months each . The first term opened in the autumn of 1870 , with an attendance of twenty students . The original location of the school was in the " North Division " of Chicago , in temporary quarters . After the fire of 1871 a removal was effected to the " West Division , " where ( in 1878 - 79 ) a modest , but well arranged building was erected . A larger structure was built in 1884 . In 1891 or 1892 , the institution became part of the Northwestern University , and changed title to Northwestern University Woman 's Medical School . The university closed the college in 1902 . The college , in all its departments , was organized along the lines of the best medical schools of the country . In 1896 , there were twenty - four professorships , all capably filled , and among the faculty are some of the best known specialists in the country .

		GOLD_MENTION=Video Music Awards
		CONTEXT=The ceremony was held on a night other than Sunday for the first time since 1976 ( the 28th Primetime Emmy Awards were also staged on a Monday that year , May 17 ) . The ceremony 's unusual date — a Monday night in late August — was due to two factors , primary being NBC 's commitment to '' Sunday Night Football '' ; since acquiring the National Football League 's Sunday night game package in 2006 , NBC , when it is their turn in the four-network rotation to air the Primetime Emmy Awards , usually schedules the ceremony for the Sunday before Labor Day weekend , to avoid conflicts with '' SNF '' in mid-September ( when ABC , CBS , or Fox normally air the ceremony ) . NBC 's ideal date on the 2014 calendar for the ceremony ( Sunday , August 24 ) led to the other scheduling factor — MTV 's Video Music Awards , which were set for that night more than a year in advance ( and would be staged in the L.A. area as well , at The Forum in Inglewood ) . On January 28 , 2014 , rather than go head-to-head with the VMA 's , NBC announced that the ceremony would take place on Monday , August 25 . The move would allow NBC to commit to a preseason '' Sunday Night Football '' broadcast for the 24th ( a game between the Cincinnati Bengals and Arizona Cardinals ) ; it also ensured the tradition of staging the Primetime Emmy Awards the weekend after the Creative Arts Emmy Awards ( that ceremony was already set for August 16 )
