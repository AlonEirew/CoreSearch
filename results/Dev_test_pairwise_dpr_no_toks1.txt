QUERY_ANSWERS={'massive flood', '1977 flood', 'Johnstown Flood of 1977'}
QUERY_CONTEXT=The flood was preceded by rains from March 9 that did not stop until March 22 , 1936 . The storms brought warmer 50 °F ( 10 °C ) weather that was a cause of one stage of flooding and the continuous rains a second cause of flooding . The natural run-off of 1 to 3 inches ( 2.5 to 7.5 cm ) was far surpassed by the deluge of from 10 to 30 inches ( 25 to 75 cm ) of water in the region . The flood came before pending flood control legislation was enacted or any significant flood control measures implemented . The narrowness of the valleys and encroachment of buildings on the river banks contributed to record flooding . By the time nightfall came one-third of the city was under of water and by the time flooding was over twenty-five people lost their lives . The damages , estimated at $ 43 million , made it the worst flood since the flood of 1889 and the event is chronicled at the Johnstown Flood Museum After the flood , sweeping nationwide flood control laws were enacted and from 1938 to 1943 Johnstown saw many projects completed . These measures gave the people the feeling that the area was now " flood free " , and it was touted as such until the flood of 1977

QUERY_CONTEXT=In early August 2012 , Israel 's National Security Council 's counter-terrorism bureau renewed its travel advisory against visiting the Sinai Peninsula , due to information on potential terrorist attacks against tourists , including kidnappings . The warning may have been due to Hamas ' release of Abu Walid al-Maqdisi , a Salafi leader of an al-Qaeda-affiliated terrorist group , responsible for three bombings in Dahab in 2006 , and which is believed to have close ties with terror cells operating in the Sinai Peninsula . The following day , the United States also issued a travel warning to Americans to " take precautions in travel to the Sinai " and warned that " overland travel from Israel to the Sinai in particular is strongly discouraged . " Over the weekend prior to the attack on the border , various intelligence reports reaching the IDF 's Southern Command warned of an impending attack . Specific information regarding the time , target , and location of the attack could not be ascertained . Still , Southern Command Maj.-Gen . Tal Russo prepared his troops in case of an attack . Armored , Engineering , and Infantry soldiers were placed on high alert while the Israeli Air Force was deployed in the area as reinforcement .

QUERY_ANSWERS={'76th ceremony', '76th Academy Awards', '2004 Academy Awards', 'Academy Awards', "previous year 's ceremony"}
QUERY_CONTEXT=In the 1959 review for '' Sight & Sound '' , David Vaughan calls '' Gigi '' " an elegant film " with a " cultivated visual taste which is everywhere apparent " . He summarises that " while '' Gigi '' does not represent a revival of the MGM musical in its heyday , it is a welcome extension of latter-day musical style in its adult subject-matter and its avoidance of spectacle made vulgar by emphasis on size . " He praises Minnelli 's talent for " the delicious amorality of the anecdote , but also the honesty and irony of its telling which have become foreign to the American cinema . " Vaughan points out " Chevalier 's practiced but irresistible charm as one of the film 's greatest assets " as well as " the brilliant high-comedy playing of Isabel Jeans , who as Aunt Alicia consummately portrays the distinction and beauty of a retired aristocrat of the '' demimonde '' . " Bosley Crowther of '' The New York Times '' called it " a musical film that bears such a basic resemblance to '' My Fair Lady '' that the authors may want to sue themselves " . He added , " But do n't think this point of resemblance is made in criticism of the film , for '' Gigi '' is a charming entertainment that can stand on its own two legs . It is not only a charming comprehension of the spicy confection of Colette , but it is also a lovely and lyrical enlargement upon that story 's flavored mood and atmosphere … Vincente Minnelli has marshaled a cast to give a set of performances that , for quality and harmony , are superb . " Abel Green of '' Variety '' called the film " 100 % escapist fare " and predicted it " is destined for a global box-office mop-up " . He added , " Alan Jay Lerner 's libretto is tailor-made for an inspired casting job for all principals , and Fritz Loewe 's tunes ( to Lerner 's lyrics ) already vie with and suggest their memorable '' My Fair Lady '' score … Miss Caron is completely captivating and convincing in the title role … Skillful casting , performance and presentation have endowed realism to the sum total … Director Minnelli 's good taste in keeping it in bounds and the general sound judgment of all concerned … distinguishes this Arthur Freed independent production . The Metrocolor rates recognition for its soft pastels under Joseph Ruttenberg 's lensing ; the Beaton costumes , sets and general production design are vivid physical assets at first sight . The skillful integration of words-and-music with the plot motivation makes this '' Gigi '' a very fair lady indeed as a boxoffice entry . " '' Time Out New York '' said , " The dominating creative contribution comes from Minnelli and Cecil Beaton … The combination of these two visual elitists is really too much — it 's like a meal consisting of cheesecake , and one quickly longs for something solid and vulgar to weigh things down . No doubt inspired by the finicky , claustrophobic sets and bric-à-brac , the cast tries ( with unfortunate success ) to be more French than the French , especially Chevalier . The exception is Gingold , who inhabits , as always , a world of her own . " '' TV Guide '' rated the film 3 ½ out of five stars , calling it " Overbaked but enjoyable , and a banquet for the eyes , thanks to the visual wonder of the Minnelli-Beaton teaming … Caron … leads the cast in a contest to see who can be the most French . The winner is Chevalier , in a performance that makes one feel as if you 're gagging on pastry … Perhaps if the sweetness of '' Gigi '' was contrasted with elements of honest vulgarity , the picture could balance itself out … Ten minutes into the movie , you 've resolved the plot and are left to wallow in lovely frou-frou . The film makes wonderful use of the usual Parisian landmarks , and benefits from extraordinary period costumes and sets . " '' Gigi '' won a record-breaking nine Academy Awards ( at the 1959 Oscars ceremony ) ; however , this record only lasted for one year , as '' Ben-Hur '' broke this record the following year with 11 Oscars . In tribute to '' Gigi '' s domination of the Oscars , the MGM switchboard answered calls the following day with " M-Gigi-M " . '' Gigi '' , eventually along with 1987 's '' The Last Emperor '' , held the record as the film ( s ) with the most Academy Award wins in every category in which it was nominated , until 2003 's '' The Lord of the Rings : The Return of the King '' broke the record at the 2004 Oscars ceremony with 11 Oscar nominations and 11 Oscar wins

		CONTEXT=In the beginning of 1920 , Sultanov intensified his efforts to bring control of the region under Azerbaijani rule by issuing an ultimatum to the Armenian National Council . In early 1920 , the Paris Peace Conference had recognized Azerbaijan 's '' de facto '' claim to Karabakh . But since the conference had ended without issuing a conclusive decision on Karabakh , Sultanov advocated for a local solution , one which demanded that the region be incorporated into Azerbaijan . He bolstered the size of the garrisons at Khankendi and continued to move his troops around , once more without the required consent of his administrative council . Ethnic tension in Karabakh heightened once more , as Azerbaijani troops lynched and killed several Armenians in Khankendi and pillaged the surrounding areas in February of that year . In early March , after a delegation of Karabakh Armenians met in the village of Shosh and rejected the possibility of union with Azerbaijan , Sultanov sought to tighten his control of Karabakh : he forbade Armenians from leaving Shusha without permission , stationed Azerbaijani troops in Armenian homes , ordered Armenian veterans of the former Russian Army to register so that they may not partake in military activities , and drew up plans to destroy several Armenian villages to sever the link between Armenians in Karabakh and the region of Zangezur . In March 1920 , mass killings of the Armenian population took place in the Shusha massacre

		CONTEXT=Critical opinion regarding the film has been overwhelmingly positive . '' The Village Voice '' critic J. Hoberman , who in 1981 included the film in his list of the ten best films commercially released in the United States during that year , more recently wrote that the film is one " of the richest avant-garde features of the 1970s " and praised its " winning combination of sexual frankness and visual wit , " while another critic , Dennis Schwartz , wrote that the " film 's beauty is derived from its sexual frankness and playfully drawn out intimate relationship scenes , witty use of photography , and its originality as it breaks free of conventional unities of body , space and time . Export skillfully edits montage and integrates video , still photography , and performance art with elements from Cubism , Surrealism , Dada and avant-garde cinema . " '' Artforum '' noted in November 1980 that " w atching their scenes together , we realize how seldom , if ever before , the details of sexual intimacy have been shown in film from the point of view from a woman . Export privileges rupture over unity and never settles for one-dimensional solutions " and it was called one " of the most original films in this year 's exposition " and a " tour de force of cinematic invention " grounded in the director 's " fresh and intelligent sensibility , characteristically self-referential . Her visual resources include mirrors , still photography , video , dance , and films within the film , all employed with a bold and surprising inventiveness " by the catalogue notes of the 1978 Los Angeles International Film Exposition . Similarly , critic Alison Butler wrote that the " film is a witty and visually brilliant essay on gender and experience , culture and environment " and program notes used by the San Francisco Cinematheque during a screening quote critic Amy Taubin as opining that the film " makes you reconsider what you and everyone else is doing — in life and in art " and critic Steve Anker underscoring that it is an important " crossover film " combining " avant-garde and theatrical sensibilities , made during the mid-1970s . It chronicles the nightmarish breakdown of a fashion photographer as she confronts her waning identity and security as a career woman ; blending narrative experimentation , fantasy , fact and theoretical critique , it has enormous impact on independent features which followed it . " PopMatters noted that the film has " enough originality to nag at patient viewers and get at least partially under our skin " and critic Michael Atkinson wrote that it is a " weird , restless , beguilingly offbeat bit of dreamwork . " The film was presented for the first time at the Berlin International Film Festival in 1977 , it has won a Special Jury Prize at the Venice Film Festival and was recently called " seminal " during a screening at a repertory cinema , " a strong and humoristic showdown " at another and " a sonically-complex , montage-rich , darkly funny and uriniferous cornerstone of avant-garde cinema " during a screening at a New York University class . Critic Peter Hajek wrote in the Austrian newspaper '' Kurier '' that " Valie Export presents this psychopanoptic view of the present in solid , striking images and often in unexpected humorous passages . " Critic Chris Holmlund , author of the scholarly article " Feminist Makeovers : The Celluloid Surgery of Valie Export and Su Friedrich , " referred to '' Invisible Adversaries '' as a feminist version of '' Invasion of the Body Snatchers '' , noted that the film includes references to famous paintings and to '' Un Chien Andalou '' , and wrote that therefore it " is visually rick , entertaining , striking , but also demanding . " A few reviews , however , were negative . For example , London 's '' Time Out '' wrote about the film that it is " n ot unlike '' W.R. : Mysteries of the Organism '' " and that it will " probably age as badly " and a reviewer for '' The Heights '' wrote that " I was expecting a great feminist work here , but got mediocrity . I can not recommend that you see this film , " though he nevertheless praised the film as a " cornucopia of video spectacle in which Export delights , confounds and amuses the audience with her antics .

		CONTEXT=From 2016 onwards , Y NOT Studios continued to contribute towards making " new wave films " in the Tamil film industry and experienced commercial success . The company collaborated with director Sudha Kongara , actor Madhavan , and debutante actress Ritika Singh to produce a bilingual sports drama film titled '' Irudhi Suttru '' ( 2016 ) in Tamil and '' Saala Khadoos '' ( 2016 ) in Hindi , which told the story of a boorish boxing coach taking on a rebellious young woman from a fishermen colony as his new student . With a publicity budget of 9 crore rupees , the promotions for the films were described by The Hindu to be " unlike other film promotions in the South " , considering that most film teams in the Tamil film industry do not usually tour around the state publicising their project . Before the release of the film , the team held several screenings to select Hindi and Tamil audiences and edited the film accordingly to the taste of the audiences . '' Irudhi Suttru '' opened to positive reviews , with a critic from Sify.com stating that the film was " a perfect sports drama , which should not be missed " and added that " this inspirational effort has a superb screenplay with all the typical elements of a good sports film in place " , while Rediff.com agreed that the film was " not to be missed " , adding " its refreshing characters , enjoyable plot , great music and visuals keeps you hooked " . Following the success of the film , Sudha Kongara remade the film in the Telugu language as '' Guru '' ( 2017 ) with Venkatesh in the lead role alongside Ritika Singh . '' Irudhi Suttru '' was later screened at the 29th Tokyo International Film Festival during October 2016 and was then also selected to be a part of the Indian Panorama section at 47th International Film Festival of India . It went on to win a National Film Award for Ritika Singh ; three Filmfare Awards for Best Director , Actor and Actress ; as well as Best Picture at the South Indian International Movie Awards and the IIFA Utsavam

In previous years , countries that received a top 10 placing were automatically granted a spot in the next year 's final without having to compete in a semi-final , but for 2008 , the EBU changed the automatic qualification regulations so that all countries except the " Big 4 " ( France , Germany , Spain , and the United Kingdom ) and host country , would have to pass through one of two semi-finals . The EBU split up countries with a friendly voting history into separate semi-finals , to give a better chance for other countries to win . Greece and Cyprus had often been accused of favoring each other , with each awarding the other the maximum number of points ( twelve ) at the previous contest . On January 28 , 2008 , the EBU held a special draw which determined that Greece would be in '' Semi-final 1 '' held on May 20 , 2008 in Belgrade , Serbia ; Cyprus was subsequently placed in the second semi-final

QUERY_CONTEXT=Although Greece had been granted a spot in the 2008 final because of its seventh-place finish at the Eurovision Song Contest 2007 , it had to compete in a semi-final for the first time since 2004 because of new rules put into effect by the European Broadcasting Union ( EBU ) . In previous years , countries that received a top 10 placing were automatically granted a spot in the next year 's final without having to compete in a semi-final , but for 2008 , the EBU changed the automatic qualification regulations so that all countries except the " Big 4 " ( France , Germany , Spain , and the United Kingdom ) and host country , would have to pass through one of two semi-finals . The EBU split up countries with a friendly voting history into separate semi-finals , to give a better chance for other countries to win . Greece and Cyprus had often been accused of favoring each other , with each awarding the other the maximum number of points ( twelve ) at the previous contest . On January 28 , 2008 , the EBU held a special draw which determined that Greece would be in '' Semi-final 1 '' held on May 20 , 2008 in Belgrade , Serbia ; Cyprus was subsequently placed in the second semi-final

The whole channel was even boycotted for a time by all kinds of Christian denominations due to " glorifying secularism and sacrilegious attitudes and spoiling the lives of young , innocent children and the youth of Finland " and the boycott was backed with the classic claims of backmasking having revealed hidden messages . At the time it was a widely believed stereotype that all metal and rock music was of the Satanist attitude , though these beliefs were mostly broken after the Eurovision Song Contest victory of Finnish heavy metal band Lordi in 2006 , which made metal music mainstream

In previous years , countries that received a top 10 placing were automatically granted a spot in the next year 's final without having to compete in a semi-final , but for 2008 , the EBU changed the automatic qualification regulations so that all countries except the " Big 4 " ( France , Germany , Spain , and the United Kingdom ) and host country , would have to pass through one of two semi-finals . The EBU split up countries with a friendly voting history into separate semi-finals , to give a better chance for other countries to win . Greece and Cyprus had often been accused of favoring each other , with each awarding the other the maximum number of points ( twelve ) at the previous contest . On January 28 , 2008 , the EBU held a special draw which determined that Greece would be in '' Semi-final 1 '' held on May 20 , 2008 in Belgrade , Serbia ; Cyprus was subsequently placed in the second semi-final

His refusal stemmed from his purported remorse at the part he had played in the killing of " all those children in Dublin " , which was a referral to his having instructed David Alexander Mulholland to drive and park the first car bomb which had detonated in Parnell Street , killing two infant girls and eight other people .

QUERY_CONTEXT=Duane Allman created the idea of having two lead guitarists , which was inspired by Curtis Mayfield ; " he wanted the bass , keyboards , and second guitar to form patterns behind the solo rather than just comping , " said Allman . Their style and incorporation of guitar harmonies was very influential on later musicians . " The pair also had a wide range of complementary techniques , often forming intricate , interlocking patterns with each other and with the bassist , Berry Oakley , setting the stage for dramatic flights of improvised melodies . " Dickey Betts ' playing was very melody-based ; " My style is just a little too smooth and round to play the blues stuff straight , because I 'm such a melody guy that even when I 'm playing the blues , I go for melody first , " he said . His listening of country and string bluegrass growing up influenced this considerably : " I played mandolin , ukulele , and fiddle before I ever touched a guitar , which may be where a lot of the major keys I play come from . " He later characterized their style as " question and answer , anticipation and conclusion , " which involved allowing each musician 's downbeat to arrive in a different spot , while also keeping consideration of the bass guitar lines . The group also held an improvisational approach to live performances , which connected the band with jam band culture . " Jazz and blues musicians have been doing this for decades , but I think they really brought that sense that anyone onstage can inspire anyone else at any given time to rock music , " said Haynes . " We sure did n't set out to be a " jam band " but those long jams just emanated from within the band , because we did n't want to just play three minutes and be over , " said Allman . '' Rolling Stone '' referred to the group as " without question the first great jam band , and they took the jam to heights that it had not previously reached . " The Allman Brothers Band were considerably influential within the Southern United States . Their arrival on the musical scene paved the way for several other notable Southern rock bands — among those Lynyrd Skynyrd , the Marshall Tucker Band and Wet Willie — to achieve commercial success , and also " almost single-handedly " made Capricorn Records into " a major independent label . " Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top , writing for '' Rolling Stone '' , wrote that the group " defined the best of every music from the American South in that time . They were the best of all of us . " He went on to call the band " a true brotherhood of players — one that went beyond race and ego . It was a thing of beauty . " The band 's extended popularity through heavy touring in the early 1990s created a new generation of fans , one that viewed the Allmans as pioneers of " latter-day collegiate jam rock . " AllMusic praised the band 's history : " they went from being America 's single most influential band to a shell of their former self trading on past glories , to reach the 21st century resurrected as one of the most respected rock acts of their era . " In 2012 , an official historic marker was erected on the site of the July 1970 Second Atlanta International Pop Festival near Byron , Georgia . The Allman Brothers Band had played two sets at the festival , which was a significant event in their career . The marker text reads , in part : " Over thirty musical acts performed , including ... Macon 's Allman Brothers Band on their launching pad to national fame . " Official sponsors of the marker included the Georgia Allman Brothers Band Association , The Allman Brothers Band Museum at the Big House , and '' Hittin ' the Note '' . In 2003 , the band released a recording of their festival opening and closing performances , '' Live at the Atlanta International Pop Festival : July 3 & 5 , 1970 ''

QUERY_CONTEXT=In a positive review for '' Cuepoint '' , Robert Christgau argued that while Azalea may never demonstrate a powerful , soulful , or attractively melodic delivery , her " striving Australian-Atlantan cadence " is original and carries every song . He deemed ' ' The New Classic '' " plenty authentic -- and damn good to boot " while dismissing Azalea 's media naysayers : " predictably , the songs where she expresses wonderment that ' Impossible Is Nothing ' are more relatable than the ones where she flaunts her liquid assets . But the ones where she pledges to keep on striving are more relatable than that , because striving is built into her flow itself . That 's what her complexity is about . " Phil Johnson from '' The Independent '' called it " an instantly engaging showcase of the 23-year-old Aussie 's talents – poppy without diluting her fierce-flowing charisma . " Kellan Miller of '' XXL '' said despite some poor songs near the end of the record , it is " a persuasive indicator that Iggy Azalea will be around for the long haul . " '' The New Classic '' was named one of the best hip-hop albums of the year by '' XXL '' on a list published on 30 June 2014 , adding that " the album proved to a gang of skepts who doubted Iggy 's controversial style from the start that she was more than capable of making hip-hop tracks with a pop appeal . " It was placed at number twenty-five on Digital Spy 's top albums of 2014 and listed among Fuse 's 40 best albums of 2014 . The album won the Breakthrough Artist Release award at the 2014 ARIA Music Awards and Favorite Rap/Hip-Hop Album at the 2014 American Music Awards , beating out Drake 's '' Nothing Was the Same '' and Eminem 's '' The Marshall Mathers LP 2 '' . It received a nomination for Best Rap Album at the 57th Grammy Awards . The album was also up for Top Rap Album at the 2015 Billboard Music Awards

		CONTEXT=Ryan Reed of '' Paste Magazine '' called it " a driving pop anthem that moves from a punchy , ' Roxanne ' - esque new-wave groove to a soulful , synth-driven chorus . " Matt Cibula of PopMatters further explained the track , writing , " It starts out like an early Police single , with some straight-up '' Reggatta de Blanc '' syncopation and a shockingly good Sting vocal impression . But the chorus opens up to turn into something less Police-y and more , dare I say it , Bruno Mars-y . " Kitty Empire of '' The Observer '' wrote that the song " channels the Police , but its 21st-century builds owe as much to rave-pop as they do to producer Mark Ronson . It 's an ill-omened meeting that somehow gels . " Jason Lipshut of '' Billboard '' gave a very positive review , stating that " ' Locked out of Heaven ' is Mars ' best solo single to date , with the singer-songwriter yelping about fornication as a tossed salad of chopped guitars and vocal exclamations buttress his sumptuous leading-man act . Sometimes , the perfect lead single is hard to find ; other times , it walks right up to you and delivers a big , cozy hug . " Melinda Newman of HitFix praised " Mars ' singing and the catchy little background vocals , " which according to her , " keep the song moving downstream at a rapid pace . " She also noted that " Even clumsy lyrics like ' your sex takes me to paradise ' ca n’t diminish that joy that the beats and melody bring .

		CONTEXT=In a positive review for '' Cuepoint '' , Robert Christgau argued that while Azalea may never demonstrate a powerful , soulful , or attractively melodic delivery , her " striving Australian-Atlantan cadence " is original and carries every song . He deemed ' ' The New Classic '' " plenty authentic -- and damn good to boot " while dismissing Azalea 's media naysayers : " predictably , the songs where she expresses wonderment that ' Impossible Is Nothing ' are more relatable than the ones where she flaunts her liquid assets . But the ones where she pledges to keep on striving are more relatable than that , because striving is built into her flow itself . That 's what her complexity is about . " Phil Johnson from '' The Independent '' called it " an instantly engaging showcase of the 23-year-old Aussie 's talents – poppy without diluting her fierce-flowing charisma . " Kellan Miller of '' XXL '' said despite some poor songs near the end of the record , it is " a persuasive indicator that Iggy Azalea will be around for the long haul . " '' The New Classic '' was named one of the best hip-hop albums of the year by '' XXL '' on a list published on 30 June 2014 , adding that " the album proved to a gang of skepts who doubted Iggy 's controversial style from the start that she was more than capable of making hip-hop tracks with a pop appeal . " It was placed at number twenty-five on Digital Spy 's top albums of 2014 and listed among Fuse 's 40 best albums of 2014 . The album won the Breakthrough Artist Release award at the 2014 ARIA Music Awards and Favorite Rap/Hip-Hop Album at the 2014 American Music Awards , beating out Drake 's '' Nothing Was the Same '' and Eminem 's '' The Marshall Mathers LP 2 '' . It received a nomination for Best Rap Album at the 57th Grammy Awards . The album was also up for Top Rap Album at the 2015 Billboard Music Awards

		CONTEXT=Ryan Reed of '' Paste Magazine '' called it " a driving pop anthem that moves from a punchy , ' Roxanne ' - esque new-wave groove to a soulful , synth-driven chorus . " Matt Cibula of PopMatters further explained the track , writing , " It starts out like an early Police single , with some straight-up '' Reggatta de Blanc '' syncopation and a shockingly good Sting vocal impression . But the chorus opens up to turn into something less Police-y and more , dare I say it , Bruno Mars-y . " Kitty Empire of '' The Observer '' wrote that the song " channels the Police , but its 21st-century builds owe as much to rave-pop as they do to producer Mark Ronson . It 's an ill-omened meeting that somehow gels . " Jason Lipshut of '' Billboard '' gave a very positive review , stating that " ' Locked out of Heaven ' is Mars ' best solo single to date , with the singer-songwriter yelping about fornication as a tossed salad of chopped guitars and vocal exclamations buttress his sumptuous leading-man act . Sometimes , the perfect lead single is hard to find ; other times , it walks right up to you and delivers a big , cozy hug . " Melinda Newman of HitFix praised " Mars ' singing and the catchy little background vocals , " which according to her , " keep the song moving downstream at a rapid pace . " She also noted that " Even clumsy lyrics like ' your sex takes me to paradise ' ca n’t diminish that joy that the beats and melody bring . " " Locked Out of Heaven " received several nominations , including Outstanding Song at the 2013 NAACP Image Awards . It was nominated for Top Radio Song and Top Pop Song at the 2013 Billboard Music Awards . The single received a nomination at the 2013 MTV Millennial Awards for International Hit of the Year .

According to Ibn al-Athir ( '' The Complete History '' , VII .370.5 – 7 ) , in AH 268 ( 881/82 CE ) , the Aghlabid commander Abū Ṯawr was defeated by the Byzantines ( probably commanded by the '' strategos '' Mosilikes ) and his was army annihilated , with only seven men surviving . The locality was later named in Arabic '' Qalʿat Abī Ṯawr '' ( " Castle of Abū Ṯawr " ) , which is the origin of the modern name . Others instead maintain that the name derives from the Arabic word " qal ' at " ( fortress ) and the Sicilian " vuturu " ( vulture ) meaning of " fortress of vultures . " The town existed under Byzantine rule pre Arab conquest as Aziz Ahmad in “ A Islamic History of Sicily ” ( edinburgh university press 1975 ) states that in 852 Abbas raided Caltavuturo in the northern part of the Island and took many prisoners who were sold as slaves , The town was the site of the so-called Caltavuturo massacre on 20 January 1893 , when local authorities killed 13 and wounded 21 peasants that had occupied communal land that they claimed was theirs

		CONTEXT=The Germans now took over the Italian zone , and soon proved to be a totally different opponent from the demoralized , war-weary and far less brutal Italians . Already since the early summer of 1943 , German troops had been pouring into Greece , fearing an Allied landing there ( in fact falling victims to a grand-scale Allied strategic deception operation , " Operation Barclay " ) . Soon they became involved in wide-ranging counterguerrilla operations , which they carried out with great ruthlessness , based on their experiences in Yugoslavia . In the course of these operations , mass reprisals were carried out , resulting in war crimes such as at Kommeno on August 16 , the Massacre of Kalavryta in December and the Massacre of Distomo in June 1944 . At the same time , hundreds of villages were systematically torched and almost one million people left homeless

However , the nascent Republican Party 's first convention took place in Philadelphia , and the 1860 elections saw the Republican Party win the state 's presidential vote and the governor 's office . After the failure of the Crittenden Compromise , the secession of the South , and the Battle of Fort Sumter , the Civil War began with Pennsylvania as a key member of the Union .

In the U.S. Presidential campaign of 1848 , Gibson supported Whig candidate , " Rough and Ready " General Zachary Taylor . However , he was concerned about the Whig Party 's lack of opposition to the abolition of slavery and personally visited Henry Clay at his home in Ashland , Kentucky in 1848 to discuss this issue .

QUERY_CONTEXT=The first official Republican convention in Illinois was held on May 29 , 1856 , in Bloomington . Chairman John M. Palmer was elected convention president after his opening address .

The following resolutions defining the party platform were approved : Resolved , That foregoing all former differences of opinions upon other questions , we pledge ourselves to unite in opposition to the present administration and to the party which upholds and supports it and to use all honorable and constitutional means to wrest the Government from the unworthy hands which now control it and to bring it back in its administration to the principles and practices of Washington , Jefferson and their great and good compatriots of the Revolution . Resolved , That foregoing all former differences of opinions upon other questions , we pledge ourselves to unite in opposition to the present administration of the Government ; that under the Constitution Congress possesses the power to prohibit slavery in the Territories ; and that , whilst we will maintain all constitutional rights of the South , we also hold that justice , humanity , the principles of freedom as expressed in our Declaration of Independence and our national constitution , and the purity and perpetuity of our Government require that that power shall be exerted to prevent the extension of slavery into territory heretofore free . Resolved , That the repeal of the Missouri Compromise was unwise and injurious ; an open and aggravated violation of the plighted faith of the States , and that the attempt of the present administration to force slavery into Kansas against the known wishes of the legal voters of that Territory is an arbitrary and tyrannous violation of the rights of the people to govern themselves , and that we will strive by all constitutional means to secure to Kansas and Nebraska the legal guaranty against slavery of which they were deprived at the cost of the violation of the plighted faith of the nation . Resolved , That we are devoted to the Union and will , to the last extremity , defend it against the efforts now being made by the dis-unionists of this administration to compass its dissolution , and that we will support the Constitution of the United States , in all its provisions regarding it , as the sacred bond of our Union and the only safeguard for the preservation of the rights of ourselves and our posterity . Resolved , That we are in favor of the immediate admission of Kansas as a member of this Confederacy under the constitution adopted by the people of said Territory . Resolved , That the spirit of our institutions as well as the Constitution of our country , guarantees the liberty of conscience as well as political freedom , and that we will proscribe no one by legislation or otherwise on account of religious opinions , or in consequence of place of birth . Lincoln delivered the closing address . The speech was purportedly so captivating that no reporter made a record of it . The address has become known as Lincoln 's Lost Speech .

They would have four more children in years to come : Alice , James , Margaret , and Harriet . It was around this time that Blaine left the Presbyterian church of his childhood and joined his wife 's new denomination , becoming a member of the South Parish Congregational Church in Augusta

		CONTEXT=The first official Republican convention in Illinois was held on May 29 , 1856 , in Bloomington . Chairman John M. Palmer was elected convention president after his opening address . Nine vice presidents and five secretaries were then elected . The convention nominated Bissell for governor with Francis Hoffmann as lieutenant governor , Ozias M. Hatch for secretary of state , Jesse K. Dubois as auditor , and James Miller as treasurer . Hoffmann was found to be ineligible for his position due to a residency requirement , and John Wood was nominated in his place . The following resolutions defining the party platform were approved : Resolved , That foregoing all former differences of opinions upon other questions , we pledge ourselves to unite in opposition to the present administration and to the party which upholds and supports it and to use all honorable and constitutional means to wrest the Government from the unworthy hands which now control it and to bring it back in its administration to the principles and practices of Washington , Jefferson and their great and good compatriots of the Revolution . Resolved , That foregoing all former differences of opinions upon other questions , we pledge ourselves to unite in opposition to the present administration of the Government ; that under the Constitution Congress possesses the power to prohibit slavery in the Territories ; and that , whilst we will maintain all constitutional rights of the South , we also hold that justice , humanity , the principles of freedom as expressed in our Declaration of Independence and our national constitution , and the purity and perpetuity of our Government require that that power shall be exerted to prevent the extension of slavery into territory heretofore free . Resolved , That the repeal of the Missouri Compromise was unwise and injurious ; an open and aggravated violation of the plighted faith of the States , and that the attempt of the present administration to force slavery into Kansas against the known wishes of the legal voters of that Territory is an arbitrary and tyrannous violation of the rights of the people to govern themselves , and that we will strive by all constitutional means to secure to Kansas and Nebraska the legal guaranty against slavery of which they were deprived at the cost of the violation of the plighted faith of the nation . Resolved , That we are devoted to the Union and will , to the last extremity , defend it against the efforts now being made by the dis-unionists of this administration to compass its dissolution , and that we will support the Constitution of the United States , in all its provisions regarding it , as the sacred bond of our Union and the only safeguard for the preservation of the rights of ourselves and our posterity . Resolved , That we are in favor of the immediate admission of Kansas as a member of this Confederacy under the constitution adopted by the people of said Territory . Resolved , That the spirit of our institutions as well as the Constitution of our country , guarantees the liberty of conscience as well as political freedom , and that we will proscribe no one by legislation or otherwise on account of religious opinions , or in consequence of place of birth . Lincoln delivered the closing address . The speech was purportedly so captivating that no reporter made a record of it . The address has become known as Lincoln 's Lost Speech .

		CONTEXT=He arrived at the club as an incredibly shy and underdeveloped personality , a fact that was noted by teammate Trent Cotchin who said though Martin was 18 “ he seemed much younger in some of the ways he behaved . ” Indeed , he struggled initially to adjust to the expectations of professional football . In one incident in the 2010 preseason he was removed from training and verbally reprimanded by club leadership when he was deemed unfit to train after a big night out . Despite these struggles , his on-field development was such that he would still debut in the 2010 season 's opening match , a 56-point Richmond loss against at the MCG . Martin recorded the sixth most disposals of any Tiger ( 18 ) to go along with four marks , three tackles and three clearances . Two weeks later Martin was convicted by the AFL tribunal for a high hit on Sydney 's Josh Kennedy in round 3 . He did not receive a suspension for the incident however , returning to football the following week . After four matches Martin ranked fourth in the league for clearances and eighth for hard-ball gets . Media reports emerged after round 8 that the 18 year old Martin had received a significant contract offer from expansion club the Greater Western Sydney Giants . The offer , which the Herald Sun ’s Mark Robinson claimed to be worth $ 2.4 million over three seasons , would have taken effect in the new club 's first AFL season in 2012 . Martin later said he had never entertained the idea of moving to the start-up club . In round 10 he had gained attention for his on-field efforts again , this time being nominated for the 2010 AFL Rising Star award after a 21 disposal and 11 clearance match against Port Adelaide . Due to his previous tribunal conviction however , Martin was ruled ineligible for the award and thus did not officially place in the end of season award 's points tally . He drew the attention of Sydney coach Paul Roos by round 14 , prompting Roos to send veteran Brett Kirk onto Martin in a tagging role . Despite this extra attention , he still managed to record 18 disposals and a goal in the match at the MCG . After 17 rounds Martin ranked second at the club for clearances and inside 50s as well as third for disposals and contested possessions . At the same time he ranked first among that season 's Rising Star nominees in clearances , contested possessions and inside 50s . He was also fourth for average disposals and fifth for average tackles . In round 19 he was rested by the club before returning to play out the final five matches of the season . He missed just that one game in his debut season and finished the year ranked second at Richmond for clearances and inside 50s , as well as third for both contested possessions and disposals . In addition to winning the Fred Swift Medal for fourth place at the club 's best and fairest night , Martin also received six votes in the Brownlow Medal count that year , the most by any Richmond debutant since Craig Lambert in 1988 . At season 's end he reiterated his commitment to the club ( and rejection of the former GWS overtures ) by signing a two-year contract extension that would keep him at Richmond until the end of the 2013 season . The extension was reported by the Herald Sun to be in the vicinity of $ 400,000-a-year

Despite this extra attention , he still managed to record 18 disposals and a goal in the match at the MCG . After 17 rounds Martin ranked second at the club for clearances and inside 50s as well as third for disposals and contested possessions .

		SCORE=0.00010342165478505194
		CONTEXT=Safety has long been a concern in the mining business , especially in sub-surface mining . The Courrières mine disaster , Europe 's worst mining accident , involved the death of 1,099 miners in Northern France on March 10 , 1906 . This disaster was surpassed only by the Benxihu Colliery accident in China on April 26 , 1942 , which killed 1,549 miners . While mining today is substantially safer than it was in previous decades , mining accidents still occur . Government figures indicate that 5,000 Chinese miners die in accidents each year , while other reports have suggested a figure as high as 20,000 . Mining accidents continue worldwide , including accidents causing dozens of fatalities at a time such as the 2007 Ulyanovskaya Mine disaster in Russia , the 2009 Heilongjiang mine explosion in China , and the 2010 Upper Big Branch Mine disaster in the United States . Mining has been identified by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ( NIOSH ) as a priority industry sector in the National Occupational Research Agenda ( NORA ) to identify and provide intervention strategies regarding occupational health and safety issues . The Mining Safety and Health Administration ( MSHA ) was established in 1978 to " work to prevent death , illness , and injury from mining and promote safe and healthful workplaces for US miners . " Since its implementation in 1978 , the number of miner fatalities has decreased from 242 miners in 1978 to 28 miners in 2015

		CONTEXT=The Newton family home is located at 904 McDonald Avenue in Santa Rosa , which is still standing . The stone railway station in the film was built in 1904 for the Northwestern Pacific Railroad and is one of the few commercial buildings in central Santa Rosa to survive the earthquake of April 18 , 1906 . The station is currently a visitor center . The library was a Carnegie Library which was demolished in 1964 due to seismic concerns . Some of the buildings in the center of Santa Rosa that are seen in the film were damaged or destroyed by earthquakes in 1969 ; much of the area was cleared of debris and largely rebuilt . The film was scored by Dimitri Tiomkin , his first collaboration with Hitchcock ( the others being '' Strangers on a Train '' , '' I Confess '' and '' Dial M for Murder '' ) . In his score , Tiomkin quotes the '' Merry Widow Waltz '' of Franz Lehár , often in somewhat distorted forms , as a leitmotif for Uncle Charlie and his serial murders . During the opening credits , the waltz theme is heard along with a prolonged shot of couples dancing

QUERY_CONTEXT=And Japan was eager to take every opportunity . In 1869 they took advantage of the defeat of the rebels of the Republic of Ezo to incorporate definitely the island of Hokkaido to Japan . For centuries , Japan viewed the Ryukyu Islands as one of its provinces . In 1871 the Mudan incident happened : cannibal Taiwanese aborigines murdered 54 Ryūkyūan sailors that had their ship shipwrecked . At that time the Ryukyu Islands were claimed by both Qing China and Japan , and the Japanese interpreted the incident as an attack on their citizens . They took steps to bring the islands in their jurisdiction : in 1872 the Japanese Ryukyu Domain was declared , and in 1874 a retaliatory incursion to Taiwan was sent , which was a success . The success of this expedition emboldened the Japanese : not even the Americans could defeat the Taiwanese cannibals in the Formosa Expedition of 1867 . Very few gave it much thought at the time , but this was the first move in the Japanese expansionism series . Japan occupied Taiwan for the rest of 1874 and then left owing to Chinese pressures , but in 1879 it finally annexed the Ryukyu Islands . In 1875 Qing China sent a 300-men force to subdue the Taiwanese cannibals , but unlike the Japanese the Chinese were routed , ambushed and 250 of their men were killed ; the failure of this expedition exposed once more the failure of Qing China to exert effective control in Taiwan , and acted as another incentive for the Japanese to annex Taiwan . Eventually , the spoils for winning the First Sino-Japanese War in 1894 included Taiwan

		SCORE=0.0002181621857744176
		CONTEXT=In the beginning of 1920 , Sultanov intensified his efforts to bring control of the region under Azerbaijani rule by issuing an ultimatum to the Armenian National Council . In early 1920 , the Paris Peace Conference had recognized Azerbaijan 's '' de facto '' claim to Karabakh . But since the conference had ended without issuing a conclusive decision on Karabakh , Sultanov advocated for a local solution , one which demanded that the region be incorporated into Azerbaijan . He bolstered the size of the garrisons at Khankendi and continued to move his troops around , once more without the required consent of his administrative council . Ethnic tension in Karabakh heightened once more , as Azerbaijani troops lynched and killed several Armenians in Khankendi and pillaged the surrounding areas in February of that year . In early March , after a delegation of Karabakh Armenians met in the village of Shosh and rejected the possibility of union with Azerbaijan , Sultanov sought to tighten his control of Karabakh : he forbade Armenians from leaving Shusha without permission , stationed Azerbaijani troops in Armenian homes , ordered Armenian veterans of the former Russian Army to register so that they may not partake in military activities , and drew up plans to destroy several Armenian villages to sever the link between Armenians in Karabakh and the region of Zangezur . In March 1920 , mass killings of the Armenian population took place in the Shusha massacre

		CONTEXT=In the beginning of 1920 , Sultanov intensified his efforts to bring control of the region under Azerbaijani rule by issuing an ultimatum to the Armenian National Council . In early 1920 , the Paris Peace Conference had recognized Azerbaijan 's '' de facto '' claim to Karabakh . But since the conference had ended without issuing a conclusive decision on Karabakh , Sultanov advocated for a local solution , one which demanded that the region be incorporated into Azerbaijan . He bolstered the size of the garrisons at Khankendi and continued to move his troops around , once more without the required consent of his administrative council . Ethnic tension in Karabakh heightened once more , as Azerbaijani troops lynched and killed several Armenians in Khankendi and pillaged the surrounding areas in February of that year . In early March , after a delegation of Karabakh Armenians met in the village of Shosh and rejected the possibility of union with Azerbaijan , Sultanov sought to tighten his control of Karabakh : he forbade Armenians from leaving Shusha without permission , stationed Azerbaijani troops in Armenian homes , ordered Armenian veterans of the former Russian Army to register so that they may not partake in military activities , and drew up plans to destroy several Armenian villages to sever the link between Armenians in Karabakh and the region of Zangezur . In March 1920 , mass killings of the Armenian population took place in the Shusha massacre

		CONTEXT=Jasser has said that he and his family have helped build a number of small mosques in different cities using locally raised funds , and at times encountering , but always overcoming local opposition . In 2010 Jasser strongly opposed the building of the Park51 project , a 13-story Islamic community center and mosque two blocks from the World Trade Center site , which is also known as Ground Zero . He said he was concerned that the funding of the $ 100 million project might be coming from foreign Islamist sources , and also said : " Ground Zero is purely about being American . It can never be about being Muslim . " Jasser believes acts of Islamic terrorism are rooted in the ideology of political Islam or Islamism . He has expressed the opinion that the 2009 Christmas Day attempted airplane bombing , the 2009 Fort Hood shooting , and the 2010 Times Square car bombing attempt have not prodded the United States into the appropriate action , but rather have resulted in politically correct denial by U.S. government authorities , and inaction by most American Muslims . He believes that even the Bush administration took inadequate measures against Islamism in America . He says the U.S. needs to provide alternatives for Muslim youth and promote reformist groups . In his television appearances , Jasser has claimed that 3 to 5 percent of U.S. Muslims are militant and 30 to 40 percent do not believe in separation of mosque and state . He also states that he believes many Western Muslim imams are too timid in their response to Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant seemingly both criticizing but also sympathizing with its goal of a caliphate stating " Clearly , the majority of the mosques in the United States are led by imams who are Islamists — who believe that in Muslim-majority countries that the state should be identified as an Islamic state . " Jasser is an outspoken supporter of Israel and believes that Muslim organizations and leaders need to be held to a litmus test to see whether they recognize Israel as a state . Jasser and a group of American Muslims founded the nonprofit American Islamic Forum for Democracy ( AIFD ) in 2003 with the goal of demonstrating the compatibility of Islam with democracy and American values . Jasser is the group 's president and chief spokesman . The AIFD supports separation of religion and state , religious pluralism , equality of the sexes , the unconditional recognition of Israel , and the creation of an independent Palestine " on the current ' occupied territories . ' " The organization rejects terrorism and any justification for it
