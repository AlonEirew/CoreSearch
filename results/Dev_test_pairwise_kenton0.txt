QUERY_ANSWERS={'1977 flood', 'massive flood', 'Johnstown Flood of 1977'}
QUERY_CONTEXT=The flood was preceded by rains from March 9 that did not stop until March 22 , 1936 . The storms brought warmer 50 °F ( 10 °C ) weather that was a cause of one stage of flooding and the continuous rains a second cause of flooding . The natural run-off of 1 to 3 inches ( 2.5 to 7.5 cm ) was far surpassed by the deluge of from 10 to 30 inches ( 25 to 75 cm ) of water in the region . The flood came before pending flood control legislation was enacted or any significant flood control measures implemented . The narrowness of the valleys and encroachment of buildings on the river banks contributed to record flooding . By the time nightfall came one-third of the city was under of water and by the time flooding was over twenty-five people lost their lives . The damages , estimated at $ 43 million , made it the worst flood since the flood of 1889 and the event is chronicled at the Johnstown Flood Museum After the flood , sweeping nationwide flood control laws were enacted and from 1938 to 1943 Johnstown saw many projects completed . These measures gave the people the feeling that the area was now " flood free " , and it was touted as such until the flood of 1977

		CONTEXT=Just Gjessing ( Oslo , 13 July 1926 – 29 October 2005 ) was a Norwegian geographer . Gjessing obtained a Ph.D. degree in 1960 with a study on Norway ’s hydrology during deglaciation . One year later he was appointed full professor . In the late 1960s Gjessing became increasingly interested in nature conservation so that in the 1970s shifted the focus of his research into environmental impact assessments . This meant leaving behind his work on pure fluvial geomorphology that had previously brought him acclaim . Following this interest he joined in 1967 the Oslo University ’s Commission for Watercourse Regulation . In 1971 he became chairman of the commission while also entering the Joint Commission for Hydroelectric Power Development and Nature Conservation , of which he was a member until 1981 . He co-authored various notable books including Beste Store Norge Atlas ( 1983 ) and the five volume work Norge ( 1984 – 1986 ) and the journal Norsk Geografisk Tidsskrift from 1979 to 1987 . In the 1980s the work of Gjessing turned increasingly international with many travels to West and North Africa where he studied environmental issues in arid and semi-arid landscapes . Gjessing ’s personality and approach made him subject of strong and lasting criticism from so - called “ rejectionist ” even within his own department at the University of Oslo . Despite their opposition Gjessing managed to establish the course Resource Geography and Landscape Ecology in 1985 , attending student demands that had emerged in the 1970s about the need of courses on natural resources and environmental management .

According to the interview , the name was derived from a local football team that was in his home town in Trinidad and Tobago , who called themselves " Oceans 11 " . In 1976 , he recorded his first album , '' Billy Ocean '' , with its first single release , " Love Really Hurts Without You " , charting at No. 2 in the UK Singles Chart and No. 22 in the US '' Billboard '' Hot 100 . He enjoyed club success from the songs " Are You Ready " and " Stay The Night " from the album '' City Limit '' — both of which were later covered by La Toya Jackson . More successes ensued , including " L.O.D. ( Love on Delivery ) " . He also wrote and composed songs for other artists . In 1981 , he scored the US R&B chart with " Nights ( Feel Like Getting Down ) . " Ocean 's period of greatest success began with the releases , during 1984 , of the album '' Suddenly '' and its main single , " Caribbean Queen ( No More Love on the Run ) " . The song 's title and lyrics were changed for different regions , such that the song is also known as " African Queen " or " European Queen " . The song won Ocean the Grammy Award for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance at the 1985 Grammy Awards and was also nominated for Best R&B Song , losing to " I Feel for You " by Prince ( songwriter ) . Ocean was later presented his award by Shalamar group member Jeffrey Daniel on '' 620 Soul Train '' , a UK incarnation of the American music dance show '' Soul Train '' . The album 's title track also became a success , peaking at No. 4 in both the US and the UK and the song " Loverboy " , while also being a No. 2 US success in 1985 was also featured in the first scene of the popular UK BBC One TV series '' Casualty '' , in 1986 .

		CONTEXT=Academic bias is the bias or perceived bias of scholars allowing their beliefs to shape their research and the scientific community . It can refer to several types of scholastic prejudice , e.g. , logocentrism , phonocentrism , ethnocentrism or the belief that some sciences and disciplines rank higher than others . In United States of America in particular , claims of bias are often linked to claims by conservatives of pervasive bias against political conservatives and religious Christians . This claim focuses on what conservatives such as David Horowitz say is discrimination against those who hold a conservative ideology and on the argument that research has been corrupted by a desire to promote a progressive agenda . Barry Ames et al. , John Lee and Henry Giroux have argued that these claims are based upon anecdotal evidence that would not reliably indicate systematic bias . Russell Jacoby has argued that claims of academic bias have been used to push measures that infringe on academic freedom .

QUERY_CONTEXT=In the 1959 review for '' Sight & Sound '' , David Vaughan calls '' Gigi '' " an elegant film " with a " cultivated visual taste which is everywhere apparent " . He summarises that " while '' Gigi '' does not represent a revival of the MGM musical in its heyday , it is a welcome extension of latter-day musical style in its adult subject-matter and its avoidance of spectacle made vulgar by emphasis on size . " He praises Minnelli 's talent for " the delicious amorality of the anecdote , but also the honesty and irony of its telling which have become foreign to the American cinema . " Vaughan points out " Chevalier 's practiced but irresistible charm as one of the film 's greatest assets " as well as " the brilliant high-comedy playing of Isabel Jeans , who as Aunt Alicia consummately portrays the distinction and beauty of a retired aristocrat of the '' demimonde '' . " Bosley Crowther of '' The New York Times '' called it " a musical film that bears such a basic resemblance to '' My Fair Lady '' that the authors may want to sue themselves " . He added , " But do n't think this point of resemblance is made in criticism of the film , for '' Gigi '' is a charming entertainment that can stand on its own two legs . It is not only a charming comprehension of the spicy confection of Colette , but it is also a lovely and lyrical enlargement upon that story 's flavored mood and atmosphere … Vincente Minnelli has marshaled a cast to give a set of performances that , for quality and harmony , are superb . " Abel Green of '' Variety '' called the film " 100 % escapist fare " and predicted it " is destined for a global box-office mop-up " . He added , " Alan Jay Lerner 's libretto is tailor-made for an inspired casting job for all principals , and Fritz Loewe 's tunes ( to Lerner 's lyrics ) already vie with and suggest their memorable '' My Fair Lady '' score … Miss Caron is completely captivating and convincing in the title role … Skillful casting , performance and presentation have endowed realism to the sum total … Director Minnelli 's good taste in keeping it in bounds and the general sound judgment of all concerned … distinguishes this Arthur Freed independent production . The Metrocolor rates recognition for its soft pastels under Joseph Ruttenberg 's lensing ; the Beaton costumes , sets and general production design are vivid physical assets at first sight . The skillful integration of words-and-music with the plot motivation makes this '' Gigi '' a very fair lady indeed as a boxoffice entry . " '' Time Out New York '' said , " The dominating creative contribution comes from Minnelli and Cecil Beaton … The combination of these two visual elitists is really too much — it 's like a meal consisting of cheesecake , and one quickly longs for something solid and vulgar to weigh things down . No doubt inspired by the finicky , claustrophobic sets and bric-à-brac , the cast tries ( with unfortunate success ) to be more French than the French , especially Chevalier . The exception is Gingold , who inhabits , as always , a world of her own . " '' TV Guide '' rated the film 3 ½ out of five stars , calling it " Overbaked but enjoyable , and a banquet for the eyes , thanks to the visual wonder of the Minnelli-Beaton teaming … Caron … leads the cast in a contest to see who can be the most French . The winner is Chevalier , in a performance that makes one feel as if you 're gagging on pastry … Perhaps if the sweetness of '' Gigi '' was contrasted with elements of honest vulgarity , the picture could balance itself out … Ten minutes into the movie , you 've resolved the plot and are left to wallow in lovely frou-frou . The film makes wonderful use of the usual Parisian landmarks , and benefits from extraordinary period costumes and sets . " '' Gigi '' won a record-breaking nine Academy Awards ( at the 1959 Oscars ceremony ) ; however , this record only lasted for one year , as '' Ben-Hur '' broke this record the following year with 11 Oscars . In tribute to '' Gigi '' s domination of the Oscars , the MGM switchboard answered calls the following day with " M-Gigi-M " . '' Gigi '' , eventually along with 1987 's '' The Last Emperor '' , held the record as the film ( s ) with the most Academy Award wins in every category in which it was nominated , until 2003 's '' The Lord of the Rings : The Return of the King '' broke the record at the 2004 Oscars ceremony with 11 Oscar nominations and 11 Oscar wins

The book is believed to have been inspired by the village of Farsa , just outside Argostoli . The love story comprising the theme of the book is set before and after the Acqui Division massacre , during the Second World War . A film adaptation was released in 2001 . During filming there was lively debate between the production team , local authorities as well as groups of citizens , as to the complex historical details of the island 's antifascist resistance . As a result , political references were omitted from the film , and the romantic core of the book was preserved , without entering complex debates about the island 's history .

The Germans therefore summarily executed over half of the divisions soldiers and all of its officers in revenge during the Massacre of the Acqui Division

		CONTEXT=The Germans now took over the Italian zone , and soon proved to be a totally different opponent from the demoralized , war-weary and far less brutal Italians . Already since the early summer of 1943 , German troops had been pouring into Greece , fearing an Allied landing there ( in fact falling victims to a grand-scale Allied strategic deception operation , " Operation Barclay " ) . Soon they became involved in wide-ranging counterguerrilla operations , which they carried out with great ruthlessness , based on their experiences in Yugoslavia . In the course of these operations , mass reprisals were carried out , resulting in war crimes such as at Kommeno on August 16 , the Massacre of Kalavryta in December and the Massacre of Distomo in June 1944 . At the same time , hundreds of villages were systematically torched and almost one million people left homeless

		CONTEXT=During the summer of 1944 , the head of the local resistance organization , Napoleon Zervas , asked the Cham Albanians to join EDES in its fight against the left-wing ELAS , but their response was negative . After that and in accordance to orders given specifically to EDES by the Allied forces to push them out of the area , fierce fighting occurred between the two sides . According to British reports , the Cham collaborationist bands managed to flee to Albania with all of their equipment , together with half million stolen cattle as well as 3,000 horses , leaving only the elderly members of the community behind . On 18 June 1944 , EDES forces with Allied support launched an attack on Paramythia . After short-term conflict against a combined Cham-German garrison , the town was finally under Allied command . Soon after , violent reprisals were carried out against the town 's Muslim community , which was considered responsible for the massacre of September 1943

		CONTEXT=The division was formed in 1939 as part of the '' Ordnungspolizei '' or Orpo ( uniformed national police ) . While all German police organizations were controlled by Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler in his capacity as Chief of German Police in the Interior Ministry , they were not at this time considered part of the SS , nor was the '' Polizei '' Division on par with the other Waffen-SS divisions . This status was reflected in the quality of the equipment they were issued and their retention of police insignia and rank structure . The division was transferred to the Waffen-SS in 1942 and was upgraded to a '' Panzergrenadier '' division . It fought in France , the Soviet Union , Greece ( where it orchestrated the Distomo massacre ) and Pomerania and surrendered to the Americans in May 1945

		CONTEXT=Operation Steinadler ( 3 – 13 July 1944 ) was the last counter-insurgency operation carried out by German forces in Macedonia . Although wide in its scope it ultimately failed to achieve its objectives as ELAS fighters successfully evaded the German patrols , returning to their hideouts once the operation was over . The civilian population thus became the main target for Axis reprisals . Shortly afterwards the German 1st Mountain Division and the 4th SS Polizei Panzergrenadier Division departed from the country , while in August Army Group E declared Greece a war zone . German shops and cultural institutions were closed , while civilians and older member of the army , secret police and SS were evacuated . Under Adolf Hitler 's orders the Wehrmacht adopted the policy of total war , in response to the rise of ELAS subversive activity which had hampered the summer harvest in areas still controlled by the collaborationist government . Army Group E 's staff deemed the preceding Distomo massacre and 1 May 1944 Kaisariani executions as excessive and even damaging to the image of the occupational authorities . The staff stressed the need to arrest insurgents rather than resorting to the collective punishment of civilians . Nevertheless , those orders were disregarded and atrocities continued unhindered . Between June and August , ELAS attacks led to the death of 30 German soldiers , 14 were wounded and 9 more were missing in action . German reprisals in their turn included the execution of 254 people

The love story comprising the theme of the book is set before and after the Acqui Division massacre , during the Second World War . A film adaptation was released in 2001 . During filming there was lively debate between the production team , local authorities as well as groups of citizens , as to the complex historical details of the island 's antifascist resistance . As a result , political references were omitted from the film , and the romantic core of the book was preserved , without entering complex debates about the island 's history . In 2005 , Riccardo Milani made his TV movie , '' Cefalonia '' , also about the massacre , with music by Ennio Morricone

		CONTEXT=Famines became common in northern China in the early 17th century because of unusually dry and cold weather that shortened the growing season – effects of a larger ecological event now known as the Little Ice Age . Famine , alongside tax increases , widespread military desertions , a declining relief system , and natural disasters such as flooding and inability of the government to properly manage irrigation and flood-control projects caused widespread loss of life and normal civility . The central government , starved of resources , could do very little to mitigate the effects of these calamities . Making matters worse , a widespread epidemic spread across China from Zhejiang to Henan , killing an unknown but large number of people . The deadliest earthquake of all time , the Shaanxi earthquake of 1556 , occurred during the Jiajing Emperor 's reign , killing approximately 830,000 people

		CONTEXT=Around the early 16th century , following the construction of the Ribeira Palace beside the Tagus river , the Palace of Alcáçova began to lose its importance . An earthquake occurring in 1531 further damaged the old castle , contributing further to its decay and neglect . In 1569 , King Sebastian ordered the rebuilding of the royal apartments in the castle , intending to use it as his official residence . As part of the rebuilding , in 1577 Filippo Terzi demolished one of the towers near the principal facade of the Church of Loreto . However , many of the works were never completed after the young king 's apparent death during the Battle of Alcácer Quibir . The following Portuguese dynastic crisis opened the way for sixty years of Spanish rule and the castle was converted into military barracks and a prison . On 30 December 1642 , Teodósio de Frias the Younger was appointed master builder to continue the works begun by his father , Luís de Frias , and his grandfather , Teodósio de Frias . This was part of a greater plan by the Spanish forces to recommission the fortification . However , after Portugal regained its independence following the Portuguese Restoration War , the works were taken over by the Portuguese government . On 6 November 1648 , Nicolau de Langres was called upon to take over the design , execution and construction of a new fortification that would surround the Castle of São Jorge and the city walls of Lisbon . In 1650 the military architect Mateus do Couto was named master builder of the project and reconstruction took on a new formality : although the military engineer João Gillot built new walls in 1652 , construction again followed Couto 's plans between 1657 and 1733 . In 1673 , the Soldiers ' Hospital , dedicated to '' São João de Deus '' ( St John of God ) , was installed on the grounds beside the Rua do Recolhimento . At the end of the 17th century the '' Recolhimento do Castelo '' ( " Castle Shelter " ) was constructed along the southeast angle of the courtyard , and in 1733 , new projects were initiated by master Custódio Vieira

In previous years , countries that received a top 10 placing were automatically granted a spot in the next year 's final without having to compete in a semi-final , but for 2008 , the EBU changed the automatic qualification regulations so that all countries except the " Big 4 " ( France , Germany , Spain , and the United Kingdom ) and host country , would have to pass through one of two semi-finals . The EBU split up countries with a friendly voting history into separate semi-finals , to give a better chance for other countries to win . Greece and Cyprus had often been accused of favoring each other , with each awarding the other the maximum number of points ( twelve ) at the previous contest . On January 28 , 2008 , the EBU held a special draw which determined that Greece would be in '' Semi-final 1 '' held on May 20 , 2008 in Belgrade , Serbia ; Cyprus was subsequently placed in the second semi-final

In previous years , countries that received a top 10 placing were automatically granted a spot in the next year 's final without having to compete in a semi-final , but for 2008 , the EBU changed the automatic qualification regulations so that all countries except the " Big 4 " ( France , Germany , Spain , and the United Kingdom ) and host country , would have to pass through one of two semi-finals . The EBU split up countries with a friendly voting history into separate semi-finals , to give a better chance for other countries to win . Greece and Cyprus had often been accused of favoring each other , with each awarding the other the maximum number of points ( twelve ) at the previous contest . On January 28 , 2008 , the EBU held a special draw which determined that Greece would be in '' Semi-final 1 '' held on May 20 , 2008 in Belgrade , Serbia ; Cyprus was subsequently placed in the second semi-final

In previous years , countries that received a top 10 placing were automatically granted a spot in the next year 's final without having to compete in a semi-final , but for 2008 , the EBU changed the automatic qualification regulations so that all countries except the " Big 4 " ( France , Germany , Spain , and the United Kingdom ) and host country , would have to pass through one of two semi-finals . The EBU split up countries with a friendly voting history into separate semi-finals , to give a better chance for other countries to win . Greece and Cyprus had often been accused of favoring each other , with each awarding the other the maximum number of points ( twelve ) at the previous contest . On January 28 , 2008 , the EBU held a special draw which determined that Greece would be in '' Semi-final 1 '' held on May 20 , 2008 in Belgrade , Serbia ; Cyprus was subsequently placed in the second semi-final

QUERY_CONTEXT=Duane Allman created the idea of having two lead guitarists , which was inspired by Curtis Mayfield ; " he wanted the bass , keyboards , and second guitar to form patterns behind the solo rather than just comping , " said Allman . Their style and incorporation of guitar harmonies was very influential on later musicians . " The pair also had a wide range of complementary techniques , often forming intricate , interlocking patterns with each other and with the bassist , Berry Oakley , setting the stage for dramatic flights of improvised melodies . " Dickey Betts ' playing was very melody-based ; " My style is just a little too smooth and round to play the blues stuff straight , because I 'm such a melody guy that even when I 'm playing the blues , I go for melody first , " he said . His listening of country and string bluegrass growing up influenced this considerably : " I played mandolin , ukulele , and fiddle before I ever touched a guitar , which may be where a lot of the major keys I play come from . " He later characterized their style as " question and answer , anticipation and conclusion , " which involved allowing each musician 's downbeat to arrive in a different spot , while also keeping consideration of the bass guitar lines . The group also held an improvisational approach to live performances , which connected the band with jam band culture . " Jazz and blues musicians have been doing this for decades , but I think they really brought that sense that anyone onstage can inspire anyone else at any given time to rock music , " said Haynes . " We sure did n't set out to be a " jam band " but those long jams just emanated from within the band , because we did n't want to just play three minutes and be over , " said Allman . '' Rolling Stone '' referred to the group as " without question the first great jam band , and they took the jam to heights that it had not previously reached . " The Allman Brothers Band were considerably influential within the Southern United States . Their arrival on the musical scene paved the way for several other notable Southern rock bands — among those Lynyrd Skynyrd , the Marshall Tucker Band and Wet Willie — to achieve commercial success , and also " almost single-handedly " made Capricorn Records into " a major independent label . " Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top , writing for '' Rolling Stone '' , wrote that the group " defined the best of every music from the American South in that time . They were the best of all of us . " He went on to call the band " a true brotherhood of players — one that went beyond race and ego . It was a thing of beauty . " The band 's extended popularity through heavy touring in the early 1990s created a new generation of fans , one that viewed the Allmans as pioneers of " latter-day collegiate jam rock . " AllMusic praised the band 's history : " they went from being America 's single most influential band to a shell of their former self trading on past glories , to reach the 21st century resurrected as one of the most respected rock acts of their era . " In 2012 , an official historic marker was erected on the site of the July 1970 Second Atlanta International Pop Festival near Byron , Georgia . The Allman Brothers Band had played two sets at the festival , which was a significant event in their career . The marker text reads , in part : " Over thirty musical acts performed , including ... Macon 's Allman Brothers Band on their launching pad to national fame . " Official sponsors of the marker included the Georgia Allman Brothers Band Association , The Allman Brothers Band Museum at the Big House , and '' Hittin ' the Note '' . In 2003 , the band released a recording of their festival opening and closing performances , '' Live at the Atlanta International Pop Festival : July 3 & 5 , 1970 ''

In the autumn of 1893 , labour conflicts in the cities and the mines came together with the protests and claims of the farmers . The movement reached its greatest breadth in the manifestations against taxes , involving the lowest tiers of the city and the countryside , becoming difficult , if not impossible , to control by its leaders

Disturbances continued throughout the year . The Fasci started out as urban movements , animated by artisans , which evolved into a more popular and combative mass movement with the adherence of sulphur miners , and in a later stage with the involvement of peasants and sharecroppers . In the autumn of 1893 , labour conflicts in the cities and the mines came together with the protests and claims of the farmers . The movement reached its greatest breadth in the manifestations against taxes , involving the lowest tiers of the city and the countryside , becoming difficult , if not impossible , to control by its leaders

		CONTEXT=On September 12 , 2009 , the EPB commemorated the birthday of Albizu . Noting that he died after being jailed , the organization insisted that justice was not yet made , expressing chagrin at the idea that some of the responsible were now regarded as historically influential people . The EBP then drew a parallel between the death of Albizu and Ojeda Ríos , accusing the local and federal authorities of complicity , as well as some pro-independence organization ms due to their silence on the matter . The group closed by claiming that the General Inspector 's report tried to blame Ojeda Ríos for the actions of a FBI squad that " wanted to eliminate the real representative of armed resistance in Puerto Rico " and compared it to the actions taken during the Romero Barceló administration in regards to the Cerro Maravilla murders , and expressed disbelief that despite cooperating with the federal agencies the local government , most notably the Police of Puerto Rico , concluded that the scene was not tampered when they only saw photographic evidence provided by the FBI . Noting that the Civil Rights Commission investigating the case questioned if the scene was tampered , the organization lamented that the report concluded that no criminal charges could be presented against the federal agent identified as " Brian " or any of the other involved

		CONTEXT=The 1977 Atocha massacre was an attack by right - wing extremists in the center of Madrid on January 24 , 1977 , which saw the assassination of five labor activists from the Communist Party of Spain ( PCE ) and the workers ' federation Comisiones Obreras ( CC.OO ) . The act occurred within the wider context of far - right reaction to Spain 's transition to constitutional democracy following the death of dictator Francisco Franco . Intended to provoke a violent left - wing response that would provide legitimacy for a subsequent right - wing counter coup d'état , the massacre had an immediate opposite effect ; generating mass popular revulsion of the far - right and accelerating the legalization of the long - banned Communist Party .

QUERY_ANSWERS={'Caltavuturo massacre'}
QUERY_CONTEXT=According to many scholars , the name and origin of the town are traced back to the period of Arab rule . According to Ibn al-Athir ( '' The Complete History '' , VII .370.5 – 7 ) , in AH 268 ( 881/82 CE ) , the Aghlabid commander Abū Ṯawr was defeated by the Byzantines ( probably commanded by the '' strategos '' Mosilikes ) and his was army annihilated , with only seven men surviving . The locality was later named in Arabic '' Qalʿat Abī Ṯawr '' ( " Castle of Abū Ṯawr " ) , which is the origin of the modern name . Others instead maintain that the name derives from the Arabic word " qal ' at " ( fortress ) and the Sicilian " vuturu " ( vulture ) meaning of " fortress of vultures . " The town existed under Byzantine rule pre Arab conquest as Aziz Ahmad in “ A Islamic History of Sicily ” ( edinburgh university press 1975 ) states that in 852 Abbas raided Caltavuturo in the northern part of the Island and took many prisoners who were sold as slaves , The town was the site of the so-called Caltavuturo massacre on 20 January 1893 , when local authorities killed 13 and wounded 21 peasants that had occupied communal land that they claimed was theirs

		CONTEXT=Tessarakonteres ( , " forty - rowed " ) , or simply " forty " was a very large catamaran galley reportedly built in the Hellenistic period by Ptolemy IV Philopator of Egypt . It was described by a number of ancient sources , including a lost work by Callixenus of Rhodes and surviving texts by Athenaeus and Plutarch . According to these descriptions , supported by modern research by Lionel Casson , the enormous size of the vessel made it impractical and it was built only as a prestige vessel , rather than an effective warship . The name " forty " refers not to the number of oars , but to the number of rowers on each column of oars that propelled it , and at the size described it would have been the largest ship constructed in antiquity , and probably the largest human - powered vessel ever built .

It is also stated that Bosniaks should be convinced that Serbs are their allies , so they would n't join the Partisans , and then kill them . " According to Bajo Stanišić , the final goal of the Chetniks was " founding of a new Serbian state , not a geographical term but a purely Serbian , with four basic attributes : the Serbian state Greater Serbia , the Serb King of the Karađorđević dynasty , Serbian nationality , and Serbian faith . The Balkan federation is also the next stage , but the main axis and leadership of this federation must be our Serbian state , that is , the Greater Serbia .

		CONTEXT=The ceremony was held on a night other than Sunday for the first time since 1976 ( the 28th Primetime Emmy Awards were also staged on a Monday that year , May 17 ) . The ceremony 's unusual date — a Monday night in late August — was due to two factors , primary being NBC 's commitment to '' Sunday Night Football '' ; since acquiring the National Football League 's Sunday night game package in 2006 , NBC , when it is their turn in the four-network rotation to air the Primetime Emmy Awards , usually schedules the ceremony for the Sunday before Labor Day weekend , to avoid conflicts with '' SNF '' in mid-September ( when ABC , CBS , or Fox normally air the ceremony ) . NBC 's ideal date on the 2014 calendar for the ceremony ( Sunday , August 24 ) led to the other scheduling factor — MTV 's Video Music Awards , which were set for that night more than a year in advance ( and would be staged in the L.A. area as well , at The Forum in Inglewood ) . On January 28 , 2014 , rather than go head-to-head with the VMA 's , NBC announced that the ceremony would take place on Monday , August 25 . The move would allow NBC to commit to a preseason '' Sunday Night Football '' broadcast for the 24th ( a game between the Cincinnati Bengals and Arizona Cardinals ) ; it also ensured the tradition of staging the Primetime Emmy Awards the weekend after the Creative Arts Emmy Awards ( that ceremony was already set for August 16 )

QUERY_CONTEXT='' The Amazing Race '' won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Reality-Competition Program for the first seven years after the creation of the award in 2003 , and ten of the twelve years since its creation , against other , more popular reality TV shows such as '' Survivor '' , '' Dancing with the Stars '' , and '' American Idol '' . Its streak was ended in 2010 when '' Top Chef '' won the Emmy for this category .

In 2011 , the show won in the category again for the eighth time . After its seventh consecutive win , some in the media , including '' Survivor '' host Jeff Probst suggested that '' The Amazing Race '' willingly drop out from the competition in future years , similar to Candice Bergen declining any further nominations after her fifth Emmy win for her role in '' Murphy Brown '' . Van Munster has stated that it is " not likely " he will pull the show from future Emmy awards , considering that it reflects on his and his crew 's hard work and high standards .

In the U.S. Presidential campaign of 1848 , Gibson supported Whig candidate , " Rough and Ready " General Zachary Taylor .

He lost as a Whig candidate for Ohio Attorney General in 1853 . In 1853 , following the large defeat of the Whig candidate General Winfield Scott in the U.S. Presidential election of 1852 , Gibson threw his support to the Free Soil Party and began organizing what would become the Republican Party in Ohio .

QUERY_CONTEXT=Gibson became involved in politics as a member of the Whig Party with strong anti-slavery views . During the U.S. Presidential campaign of 1844 , he gave stump speeches for Henry Clay due to the Whig Party 's platform that opposed admitting Texas into the Union because it was a slave state . In the U.S. Presidential campaign of 1848 , Gibson supported Whig candidate , " Rough and Ready " General Zachary Taylor . However , he was concerned about the Whig Party 's lack of opposition to the abolition of slavery and personally visited Henry Clay at his home in Ashland , Kentucky in 1848 to discuss this issue . He lost as a Whig candidate for Ohio Attorney General in 1853 . In 1853 , following the large defeat of the Whig candidate General Winfield Scott in the U.S. Presidential election of 1852 , Gibson threw his support to the Free Soil Party and began organizing what would become the Republican Party in Ohio .

QUERY_CONTEXT=The first official Republican convention in Illinois was held on May 29 , 1856 , in Bloomington . Chairman John M. Palmer was elected convention president after his opening address . Nine vice presidents and five secretaries were then elected . The convention nominated Bissell for governor with Francis Hoffmann as lieutenant governor , Ozias M. Hatch for secretary of state , Jesse K. Dubois as auditor , and James Miller as treasurer . Hoffmann was found to be ineligible for his position due to a residency requirement , and John Wood was nominated in his place . The following resolutions defining the party platform were approved : Resolved , That foregoing all former differences of opinions upon other questions , we pledge ourselves to unite in opposition to the present administration and to the party which upholds and supports it and to use all honorable and constitutional means to wrest the Government from the unworthy hands which now control it and to bring it back in its administration to the principles and practices of Washington , Jefferson and their great and good compatriots of the Revolution . Resolved , That foregoing all former differences of opinions upon other questions , we pledge ourselves to unite in opposition to the present administration of the Government ; that under the Constitution Congress possesses the power to prohibit slavery in the Territories ; and that , whilst we will maintain all constitutional rights of the South , we also hold that justice , humanity , the principles of freedom as expressed in our Declaration of Independence and our national constitution , and the purity and perpetuity of our Government require that that power shall be exerted to prevent the extension of slavery into territory heretofore free . Resolved , That the repeal of the Missouri Compromise was unwise and injurious ; an open and aggravated violation of the plighted faith of the States , and that the attempt of the present administration to force slavery into Kansas against the known wishes of the legal voters of that Territory is an arbitrary and tyrannous violation of the rights of the people to govern themselves , and that we will strive by all constitutional means to secure to Kansas and Nebraska the legal guaranty against slavery of which they were deprived at the cost of the violation of the plighted faith of the nation . Resolved , That we are devoted to the Union and will , to the last extremity , defend it against the efforts now being made by the dis-unionists of this administration to compass its dissolution , and that we will support the Constitution of the United States , in all its provisions regarding it , as the sacred bond of our Union and the only safeguard for the preservation of the rights of ourselves and our posterity . Resolved , That we are in favor of the immediate admission of Kansas as a member of this Confederacy under the constitution adopted by the people of said Territory . Resolved , That the spirit of our institutions as well as the Constitution of our country , guarantees the liberty of conscience as well as political freedom , and that we will proscribe no one by legislation or otherwise on account of religious opinions , or in consequence of place of birth . Lincoln delivered the closing address . The speech was purportedly so captivating that no reporter made a record of it . The address has become known as Lincoln 's Lost Speech .

		CONTEXT=He arrived at the club as an incredibly shy and underdeveloped personality , a fact that was noted by teammate Trent Cotchin who said though Martin was 18 “ he seemed much younger in some of the ways he behaved . ” Indeed , he struggled initially to adjust to the expectations of professional football . In one incident in the 2010 preseason he was removed from training and verbally reprimanded by club leadership when he was deemed unfit to train after a big night out . Despite these struggles , his on-field development was such that he would still debut in the 2010 season 's opening match , a 56-point Richmond loss against at the MCG . Martin recorded the sixth most disposals of any Tiger ( 18 ) to go along with four marks , three tackles and three clearances . Two weeks later Martin was convicted by the AFL tribunal for a high hit on Sydney 's Josh Kennedy in round 3 . He did not receive a suspension for the incident however , returning to football the following week . After four matches Martin ranked fourth in the league for clearances and eighth for hard-ball gets . Media reports emerged after round 8 that the 18 year old Martin had received a significant contract offer from expansion club the Greater Western Sydney Giants . The offer , which the Herald Sun ’s Mark Robinson claimed to be worth $ 2.4 million over three seasons , would have taken effect in the new club 's first AFL season in 2012 . Martin later said he had never entertained the idea of moving to the start-up club . In round 10 he had gained attention for his on-field efforts again , this time being nominated for the 2010 AFL Rising Star award after a 21 disposal and 11 clearance match against Port Adelaide . Due to his previous tribunal conviction however , Martin was ruled ineligible for the award and thus did not officially place in the end of season award 's points tally . He drew the attention of Sydney coach Paul Roos by round 14 , prompting Roos to send veteran Brett Kirk onto Martin in a tagging role . Despite this extra attention , he still managed to record 18 disposals and a goal in the match at the MCG .

After that , I would record my vocals on it and send it back to him . That 's how we started . " Among their first two singles duo release ' Rise on Your Broken Knees ' first which was n't a hit and did below the average at topping charts , however this gives the duo enough recognition so they would upload their second release . Overwhelming response from the audience led the artist to eventually meet and work on their second single for a better music video and re-release of the " '' Za Pakhtoon Yam '' " , for the video the maximum shot was done in Peshawar , while the rest was shot in Karachi . The song is entirely sung in Pashtu language , giving an inspirational message about Pakhtuns , according to duo its about giving them their identity , speaking about song Naseer explained , " The song is thematic . The reason why we recorded it in the first place was not only because we wanted Pakhtuns to relate to it but also to encourage like-minded Pakhtuns to celebrate their identity . " Success of " '' Za Pakhtoon Yam '' " , established the duo as a music band in the industry , cherishing the success Qamar says , " The most exciting part is the non-Pakhtuns coming in and expressed their genuine feelings and I think that is our biggest achievement to date " , while Naseer who penned down the song summarize , " I have tried my best to put the true Pashto identity in a compressed form in these verses . We have had so many peace loving people in our cultural history but sadly we never promote them . People are n't even aware of the fact that musician Haroon Bacha was threatened by conservative parties that he would be banished from Pakistan if does n't stop making music in K-P . " After the success of " '' Za Pakhtoon Yam '' " , the duo released " Za Sata Pashan Nayam " ( I am not like you ) , which added further acclaim to their success which leads them to national success earning wide spread acclaim .

		CONTEXT=This is one of three tracks on '' The Beginning '' to be produced by Damien " DJ Ammo " LeRoy , the other two being the lead single " The Time ( Dirty Bit ) " and " Do It Like This " . '' The Beginning '' 's third single was announced on The Black Eyed Peas ' official website on May 9 , 2011 . Described as a " buzzing , hot club jam " , it features whooshing synths and slap-funk bass grooves . It is the longest track on the album at close to six minutes . The Black Eyed Peas member will.i.am told '' Spin '' magazine that he is proud enough of the song that he 'd even play it for Jay-Z . " I would go to Jay 's studio and play this be like ' Boom ! Check it out ! " , said Will . " Then I go dirty Caribbean on him on the last verse . " Monica Herrera wrote for '' Billboard '' that " the music is expertly produced , but problems arise when Will.i.am claims the same of his wordplay . On the track ' Do n't Stop the Party ' , he chest-thumps , ' Kill you with my lyricals/Call me verbal criminal . ' It 's a silly boast for an artist who clearly focuses on beats over rhymes , and is probably better off for it . " Andy Gill wrote for '' The Independent '' that " with martial synth-stomp riffs , spartan electro beats and loping bass grooves driving tracks whose single-mindedness is signalled by titles like ' Do n't Stop the Party ' . " A positive review came from Bill Lamb , editor from About.com , who went to say that : " BEP boost the beat as they request ' Do n't Stop the Party ' . " Lamb said that " will.i.am starts talking about futurism here again and sure enough we find ourselves in the middle of a futuristic sounding trance break . The party reaches its peak about five minutes into the song , and it is exhilarating . " Other positive reaction came from John Bush , editor from Allmusic who went to say that the song is a " scattered moment of respectability " and chose it as an " AMG Pick " . Gavin Martin wrote for '' Daily Mirror '' that " the operatically ambitious ' Do n't Stop the Party ' gives way to a briefly terrifying interlude that is more or less a declaration of earth-shaking sonic war . " The music video , which is directed by Ben Mor , features on-stage and backstage footages of the group during their ' The E.N.D. World Tour ' in Brazil in 2010 and was released to iTunes and YouTube/VEVO on May 10 , 2011 .

		CONTEXT=2NE1 's first extended play '' 2NE1 '' ( 2009 ) was preceded by two singles . The first one , " Lollipop " , was recorded with label mate Big Bang and released on March 27 , 2009 to promote the LG Cyon phone . Though a music video was filmed , " Lollipop " was not promoted due to its product advertisement affiliation , which caused issues with the network chart eligibility . The second single , " Fire " , written and produced by 1TYM 's Teddy Park , was released that May and contained elements of hip-hop and reggae . Its music video had two versions — a " space " version and a " street " version . Within the first 24 hours of release , the videos each received over one million views . Both the song " Fire " and the group became popular online search terms . The final single , " I Do n't Care " , was released simultaneously alongside their first eponymous EP in July . Promotional activities quickly followed to demonstrate a softer , more feminine image of the group to contrast the edgier image previously portrayed in " Fire " . " I Do n't Care " became the most downloaded song of that month , later winning Song of the Year at the Mnet Asian Music Awards . Although group members recorded and released their own solo materials in August , they performed a reggae version of " I Do n't Care " on '' Inkigayo '' in September . Due to the remix 's popularity , it was released to digital outlets on September 3 as their next digital single . Buoyed by the success of their singles , sales of '' 2NE1 '' totaled 100,000 copies by the end of the year . 2NE1 later performed at the 6th Asia Song Festival , representing Korea alongside three other groups and later winning the Asian Newcomer 's award . In 2010 , 2NE1 unexpectedly released " Try to Follow Me " in February through various digital outlets without any prior announcement or promotion to support the Samsung 's Corby Folder . The song peaked at number one on the Gaon Digital Chart . That summer , 2NE1 traveled to Los Angeles and London to record English songs for an American debut album with The Black Eyed Peas 's member and music producer will.i.am . The group recorded a total of 10 songs in their initial sessions . The quartet 's first full-length album , '' To Anyone '' ( 2010 ) , was released on September 9 , and debuted at number 7 on the Billboard World Album Chart . Prior to the release of the album , it had already received 120,000 preorders . Containing a total of 12 tracks , four singles were released : the top five hits " Clap Your Hands " , " Ca n't Nobody " , " It Hurts ( Slow ) " and the chart-topping " Go Away " . A fifth song " Do n't Stop the Music " was recorded as a " special gift for Thai fans " and was also used in conjunction with the group 's Yamaha Fiore endorsement . At the 2010 Mnet Asian Music Awards , 2NE1 took home the most accolades : " Artist of the Year " , " Best Music Video " for " Ca n't Nobody " , " Best Female Group " , and " Album of the Year " award

		CONTEXT=He arrived at the club as an incredibly shy and underdeveloped personality , a fact that was noted by teammate Trent Cotchin who said though Martin was 18 “ he seemed much younger in some of the ways he behaved . ” Indeed , he struggled initially to adjust to the expectations of professional football . In one incident in the 2010 preseason he was removed from training and verbally reprimanded by club leadership when he was deemed unfit to train after a big night out . Despite these struggles , his on-field development was such that he would still debut in the 2010 season 's opening match , a 56-point Richmond loss against at the MCG . Martin recorded the sixth most disposals of any Tiger ( 18 ) to go along with four marks , three tackles and three clearances . Two weeks later Martin was convicted by the AFL tribunal for a high hit on Sydney 's Josh Kennedy in round 3 . He did not receive a suspension for the incident however , returning to football the following week . After four matches Martin ranked fourth in the league for clearances and eighth for hard-ball gets . Media reports emerged after round 8 that the 18 year old Martin had received a significant contract offer from expansion club the Greater Western Sydney Giants . The offer , which the Herald Sun ’s Mark Robinson claimed to be worth $ 2.4 million over three seasons , would have taken effect in the new club 's first AFL season in 2012 . Martin later said he had never entertained the idea of moving to the start-up club . In round 10 he had gained attention for his on-field efforts again , this time being nominated for the 2010 AFL Rising Star award after a 21 disposal and 11 clearance match against Port Adelaide . Due to his previous tribunal conviction however , Martin was ruled ineligible for the award and thus did not officially place in the end of season award 's points tally . He drew the attention of Sydney coach Paul Roos by round 14 , prompting Roos to send veteran Brett Kirk onto Martin in a tagging role . Despite this extra attention , he still managed to record 18 disposals and a goal in the match at the MCG . After 17 rounds Martin ranked second at the club for clearances and inside 50s as well as third for disposals and contested possessions . At the same time he ranked first among that season 's Rising Star nominees in clearances , contested possessions and inside 50s . He was also fourth for average disposals and fifth for average tackles . In round 19 he was rested by the club before returning to play out the final five matches of the season . He missed just that one game in his debut season and finished the year ranked second at Richmond for clearances and inside 50s , as well as third for both contested possessions and disposals . In addition to winning the Fred Swift Medal for fourth place at the club 's best and fairest night , Martin also received six votes in the Brownlow Medal count that year , the most by any Richmond debutant since Craig Lambert in 1988 . At season 's end he reiterated his commitment to the club ( and rejection of the former GWS overtures ) by signing a two-year contract extension that would keep him at Richmond until the end of the 2013 season . The extension was reported by the Herald Sun to be in the vicinity of $ 400,000-a-year

QUERY_CONTEXT=" Motivation " is a R&B slow jam song written by Richard Butler ( Rico Love ) , Jim Jonsin , Dwayne Carter and Danny Morris . The racy lyrics center around Rowland asking her man to use his hands all over her body , and are accompanied by a " synth-saturated beat " produced by Jonsin . In terms of instruments , " Motivation " uses sparse keyboard notes , programmed beats and pulsing synths in the chorus . Wayne adds a rap verse complementing Rowland 's seductive suggestions , using the kitchen and a car as metaphors for sex . According to Scott Shetler from AOL Music , Rowland uses the lyrics to promise " to be her lover 's motivation . " Rowland called the record a mixture between dance and mash-up . When asked by MTV what Rowland thought of the song , she said , " It has that personality and characteristic to it that I do n't think anybody can deny . That 's why when Wayne dropped that insane verse on there ... I was like , ' You really brought that up even more . ' He went into the studio and just did it . I do n't think it takes much for Wayne to think . He just does it . He 's so admirable . " Ryan Brockington , from the '' New York Post , '' was amongst the first to review " Motivation . " In his review , he said " The single is a big leap from the dance club synth pop that Kelly has been releasing the past year and it seems like she might be trying to shimmy her way back into the hip-hop world by teaming up with the Midas touch vocals of Lil Wayne . " Both '' Rap-Up '' and AOL Music 's Scott Shetler called the song " sexy . " Becky Bain from Idolator disliked the song for not being memorable . The short review was summed up with the closing phrase , " she ’s going to need another hit to help promote her album when it finally is ready to drop . " Wesley Case from '' The Baltimore Sun '' complemented the song 's sexy quality . " If this is n't the year 's hands-down sexiest song thus far , it has to be in the discussion . Rowland , whose sultry voice could get a priest hot , weaving in and out of the minimal beat , and setting the table for Lil Wayne 's stuttering , after-hours guest-verse . Stack the pieces together and it 's an understated knockout that gets sexier with each spin . " Billboard ranked it number five on their " Critics ' Picks : 20 Best Songs of 2011 " " Motivation " was nominated for two awards at the 2011 Soul Train Music Awards including Best Dance Performance and Song of the Year.It won the award for Song of the Year and was also nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration at the 54th Grammy Awards , which was held on February 12 , 2012

		CONTEXT=Not long after the launch of Operation Barbarossa Visaitov first saw combat against German forces in June 1941 as a squadron commander in the 34th Cavalry Regiment on the Southwestern Front . During the defense of Ukraine on 24 July 1941 he was wounded in the left shoulder and treated in a hospital until the end of August . After recovering he participated in the defense of Kiev as commander of a separate reconnaissance battalion of the 206th Rifle Division . On 19 September 1941 while the division was encircled near the city of Boryspil , Visaitov took command of over 200 men and managed to reunite them with troops in Donbas . He went on to take part in the defense of Rostov-on-Don before he sustained frostbite in his hand and severely injured his right leg in November 1941 . He was sent to a hospital in Pyatigorsk where he remained recovering until the beginning of 1942 , after which he was appointed as the chief of staff of the newly formed 255th Separate Chechen-Ingush Cavalry Regiment , which was initially placed under the command of Yaponts Abadiyev ; later Abadiyev was appointed to a different position and Visaitov was made the commander of the regiment on 13 May 1942 . From the very beginning of the Battle of Stalingrad the regiment saw heavy battle ; on 3 August 1942 while covering the retreat of Soviet troops the regiment was engaged by the 78th Tank Corps of the Wehrmacht near Kotelnikovo . During the engagement the regiment took out four German tanks but suffered heavy losses from both German tanks and aviation-based attacks from numerically superior forces . Facing constant bombardment and high casualties , the regiment was forced to retreat , and after suffering further losses in Stalingrad the regiment was divided into two independent reconnaissance battalions for the 4th Cavalry Corps . Visaitov himself had expressed his disagreement with orders to send horsemen to fight against heavily armored German tanks , and he was punished for expressing such concerns ; but members of his regiment appreciated that he did not want to lead them to a certain death . As the regiment was being dissolved , in October 1942 Visaitov was placed in command of one of the separate reconnaissance battalions , and remained in that position until January 1943 , after which he was placed in charge of cavalry courses which trained junior lieutenants of the Southern Front . In September that same year he was reassigned again as an assistant inspector of cavalry , and fought in battles throughout Ukraine until he was expelled from his post into the reserve in May 1944 because he was Chechen ; in February 1944 the entire Chechen nation was declared to be traitors , and the civilian population was deported to Central Asia

		SCORE=0.01797527214512229
		CONTEXT=Rasputin 's daughter Maria died in the 2006 crash of S7 Airlines Flight 778 , and his wife died six years later . He died in Moscow on 14 March 2015 , a day short of his 78th birthday . Patriarch Kirill of the Russian Orthodox Church conducted his funeral service , and President Vladimir Putin paid his respects . ( In 2014 Rasputin had co-signed a letter by writers in support of Putin 's annexation of the Crimea . ) Rasputin is closely associated with a movement in post-war Soviet literature known as " village prose , " or sometimes " rural prose " ( деревенская проза ) . Beginning in the time of the Khrushchev Thaw ( оттепель ) , village prose was praised for its stylistic and thematic departures from socialist realism . Village prose works usually focused on the hardships of the Soviet peasantry , espoused an idealized picture of traditional village life , and implicitly or explicitly criticized official modernization projects . Rasputin 's 1979 novel '' Farewell to Matyora '' , which depicts a fictional Siberian village which is to be evacuated and cleared so that a hydroelectric dam can be constructed further down the Angara River , was considered the epitome of this genre . The opening paragraph below is a good example of Rasputin 's writing style ( exceptional even for the village prose writers ) , and the novel 's theme of natural cycles disrupted by modernization : '' Once more spring had come , one more in the never-ending cycle , but for Matyora this spring would be the last , the last for both the island and the village that bore the same name . Once more , rumbling passionately , the ice broke , piling up mounds on the banks , and the liberated Angara River opened up , stretching out into a mighty , sparkling flow . Once more the water gushed boisterously at the island ’s upper tip , before cascading down both channels of the riverbed ; once more greenery flared on the ground and in the greens , the first rains soaked the earth , the swifts and swallows flew back , and at dusk in the bogs the awakened frogs croaked their love of life . It had all happened many times before . '' ( From Rasputin 's novel '' Farewell to Matyora '' , translated by Antonina W. Bouis , 1979 ) Rasputin 's nonfiction works contain similar themes , often in support of relevant political causes . He directed particularly trenchant criticism at large-scale dam building , like the project that flooded his own hometown , and water management projects , like the diversion of the Siberian rivers to Central Asia . He argued that these projects were destructive not simply in an ecological sense , but in a moral sense as well

		SCORE=0.004004384158179164
		CONTEXT=This was the epoch of the world oil trade . The underground black liquid promised entrepreneurs incredible profits and opened ambitious prospects . The only requirements were a large investment and the ability to run the business . These Mantashev had . His chief accountant recalled that not a single document went into effect without Alexander 's resolution , " Asttsov " ( " with God " in Armenian ) . Mantashev , not being afraid of high risk investments , bought ( together with another Armenian colleague , Michael Aramyants ) unprofitable oil wells in Baku that very soon became profitable . In 1894 he created a tentative association along with the other major oil interests in Russia , the Nobels and the Rothschilds , in order to cooperate in the marketing of petroleum products within certain geographical areas . This was in response to Standard Oil 's aggressive marketing policy . In 1896 , during a trip to Egypt , Mantashev met Calouste Gulbenkian who was fleeing the Ottoman Empire with his family as a result of the Hamidian massacres . Mantashev introduced Gulbenkian to the right circles in Cairo , including Sir Evelyn Baring . For refining oil , Mantashev built a kerosene plant in Baku , as well as a lubricant plant and a marine refinery for pumping oil and fuel to vessels . His company owned a factory for the fabrication of canisters for the packaging and storage of oil in Batumi , a mechanical workshop in Zabrat , an oil pumping station in Odessa , and even one hundred freight cars circulating in the southwestern railways of Russia . ( The young Joseph Stalin organized strikes in Mantashev 's Batumi factory and participated in street demonstrations in 1902 . ) In England Mantashev bought two tankers , which supplied oil to India , China , Japan and the Mediterranean countries . In 1899 he created the trading house " A.I. Mantashev and Co. " , opening representative offices and warehouses in the major cities of Europe and Asia : Smyrna , Thessaloniki , Constantinople , Alexandria , Cairo , Port Said , Damascus , Paris , London , Bombay and Shanghai . Mantashev became a shareholder in a number of oil companies , among them the Nobel Brothers . 51.3 % of the total stock of oil and 66.8 % of the oil content in the Caspian Sea was centered on the firm . In 1904 , it was the third largest oil company in Baku , next to only the Nobel Brothers and the Caspian Sea Society of the Rothschild brothers

In 1169 , a huge earthquake scattered the population of the mainland , divided between the numerous boroughs of Aci . Another Aquilia was founded in the late 14th century further north , creating the nucleus of the modern city . The only remains of the medieval Aquilia Nova ( " New Aquilia " ) is the Gothic-Lombard-styled portal of the church of Saint Anthony ( in Italian language called " chiesa di Sant ' Antonino di Padova " )

		CONTEXT=SISSA was founded in 1978 , as a part of the reconstruction following the Friuli earthquake of 1976 . Although the city of Trieste itself did not suffer any damage , physicist Paolo Budinich asked and obtained from the Italian government to include in the interventions the institution of a new , post-graduate teaching and research institute , modeled on the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa . The school became operative with a PhD course in theoretical physics , and Budinich himself was appointed as general director . In 1986 , Budinich left his position to Daniele Amati , who at the time was at the head of the theoretical division at CERN . Under his leadership , SISSA expanded its teaching and research activity towards the field of neuroscience , and instituted a new interdisciplinary laboratory aiming at connecting humanities and scientific studies . From 2001 to 2004 , the director was the Italian geneticist Edoardo Boncinelli , who fostered the development of the existing research areas . Other directors were appointed in the following years , which saw the strengthening of SISSA collaboration with other Italian and European universities in offering master 's degree programs in the three areas of the School ( mathematics , physics and neuroscience ) . The physicist Stefano Ruffo , the current director , was appointed in 2015 . He signed a partnership with the International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology to set up a new PhD program in Molecular Biology , with teaching activity organized by both institutions

In 1869 they took advantage of the defeat of the rebels of the Republic of Ezo to incorporate definitely the island of Hokkaido to Japan . For centuries , Japan viewed the Ryukyu Islands as one of its provinces . In 1871 the Mudan incident happened : cannibal Taiwanese aborigines murdered 54 Ryūkyūan sailors that had their ship shipwrecked . At that time the Ryukyu Islands were claimed by both Qing China and Japan , and the Japanese interpreted the incident as an attack on their citizens . They took steps to bring the islands in their jurisdiction : in 1872 the Japanese Ryukyu Domain was declared , and in 1874 a retaliatory incursion to Taiwan was sent , which was a success . The success of this expedition emboldened the Japanese : not even the Americans could defeat the Taiwanese cannibals in the Formosa Expedition of 1867 . Very few gave it much thought at the time , but this was the first move in the Japanese expansionism series . Japan occupied Taiwan for the rest of 1874 and then left owing to Chinese pressures , but in 1879 it finally annexed the Ryukyu Islands . In 1875 Qing China sent a 300-men force to subdue the Taiwanese cannibals , but unlike the Japanese the Chinese were routed , ambushed and 250 of their men were killed ; the failure of this expedition exposed once more the failure of Qing China to exert effective control in Taiwan , and acted as another incentive for the Japanese to annex Taiwan .

It is a form of efflorescence of salts formed by the reaction of acidic vapors with the basic calcareous surface . The efflorescence can sometimes superficially resemble a growth of mold . Although first described in the early 19th century , Bynesian decay was not well understood until almost a hundred years later . The condition is named after the man ( L. Byne ) who is best known for describing it in the late 19th century , even though he was not the first person to describe it in print . In addition , Byne mistakenly assumed that the condition was caused by bacteria , and thus the condition came to be referred to as a " disease " .

		CONTEXT=Spit Bay ( ) is an open bight formed by the northeast coastline of Heard Island and Spit Point , the east extremity of the island . The name derives from the conspicuous Elephant Spit which forms the south and east shore of the bight , and may have been given by American sealers at Heard Island in the period following their initiation of sealing there in 1855 . The name appears on a chart by the British utilized many names then in use by the sealers . Heard Island and McDonald Islands are located in the Southern Ocean , approximately from the Antarctic continent and southwest of Perth . As the only volcanically active subantarctic islands , they " open a window into the earth " , thus providing the opportunity to observe ongoing geomorphic processes and glacial dynamics . The distinctive conservation value of Heard and McDonald – one of the world 's rare pristine island ecosystems – lies in the complete absence of alien plants and animals , as well as human impact .

		CONTEXT=Diving hazards are the agents or situations that pose a threat to the underwater diver or their equipment . Divers operate in an environment for which the human body is not well suited . They face special physical and health risks when they go underwater or use high pressure breathing gas . The consequences of diving incidents range from merely annoying to rapidly fatal , and the result often depends on the equipment , skill , response and fitness of the diver and diving team . The classes of hazards include the aquatic environment , the use of breathing equipment in an underwater environment , exposure to a pressurised environment and pressure changes , particularly pressure changes during descent and ascent , and breathing gases at high ambient pressure . Diving equipment other than breathing apparatus is usually reliable , but has been known to fail , and loss of buoyancy control or thermal protection can be a major burden which may lead to more serious problems . There are also hazards of the specific diving environment , and hazards related to access to and egress from the water , which vary from place to place , and may also vary with time . Hazards inherent in the diver include pre-existing physiological and psychological conditions and the personal behaviour and competence of the individual . For those pursuing other activities while diving , there are additional hazards of task loading , of the dive task and of special equipment associated with the task .

		CONTEXT=By studying the designs on the porcelain shards , a team of researchers led by Scott Williams concluded in 2011 that the wreck must date from the late 17th century . According to the comprehensive records kept by the Spanish government of the time , only two Manila galleons went missing during that period – the '' Santo Christo de Burgos '' , in 1693 , and the '' San Francisco Xavier '' , in 1705 . The '' San Francisco Xavier '' was initially considered the more likely candidate , partly because it was thought that a tsunami which struck the Oregon coast in 1700 would have destroyed any evidence of an earlier shipwreck ; however , after conducting further surveys , Williams ' team now believes that the tsunami played a key role in dispersing the debris along the coastline , and that the wreck 's true identity is therefore the '' Santo Christo de Burgos '' . They also believe that the wreck is probably located further north than previously thought , close to Neahkahnie Mountain

		CONTEXT=Sloane 's viperfish , Chauliodus sloani , is a predatory , mesopelagic dragonfish found in deep - pelagic waters across the world . The species was first described by German scientists Marcus Elieser Bloch and Johann Gottlob Schneider in their 1801 book Systema ichthyologiae : iconibus CX illustratum , volume 1 . Its size can range from 64 mm to 260 mm , and it is an iridescent silver - blue color . It has two rows of photophores , one on each side of the ventral part of its body . It is believed that C. sloani adjusts the intensity of ventral photophores during diurnal migrations to camouflage itself from predators that might see its shadow from below .

QUERY_CONTEXT=In December 1871 , a Ryukyuan ship was shipwrecked on Taiwan and the crew were massacred .

		CONTEXT=And Japan was eager to take every opportunity . In 1869 they took advantage of the defeat of the rebels of the Republic of Ezo to incorporate definitely the island of Hokkaido to Japan . For centuries , Japan viewed the Ryukyu Islands as one of its provinces . In 1871 the Mudan incident happened : cannibal Taiwanese aborigines murdered 54 Ryūkyūan sailors that had their ship shipwrecked . At that time the Ryukyu Islands were claimed by both Qing China and Japan , and the Japanese interpreted the incident as an attack on their citizens . They took steps to bring the islands in their jurisdiction : in 1872 the Japanese Ryukyu Domain was declared , and in 1874 a retaliatory incursion to Taiwan was sent , which was a success . The success of this expedition emboldened the Japanese : not even the Americans could defeat the Taiwanese cannibals in the Formosa Expedition of 1867 . Very few gave it much thought at the time , but this was the first move in the Japanese expansionism series . Japan occupied Taiwan for the rest of 1874 and then left owing to Chinese pressures , but in 1879 it finally annexed the Ryukyu Islands . In 1875 Qing China sent a 300-men force to subdue the Taiwanese cannibals , but unlike the Japanese the Chinese were routed , ambushed and 250 of their men were killed ; the failure of this expedition exposed once more the failure of Qing China to exert effective control in Taiwan , and acted as another incentive for the Japanese to annex Taiwan . Eventually , the spoils for winning the First Sino-Japanese War in 1894 included Taiwan

		CONTEXT=The ceremony was held on a night other than Sunday for the first time since 1976 ( the 28th Primetime Emmy Awards were also staged on a Monday that year , May 17 ) . The ceremony 's unusual date — a Monday night in late August — was due to two factors , primary being NBC 's commitment to '' Sunday Night Football '' ; since acquiring the National Football League 's Sunday night game package in 2006 , NBC , when it is their turn in the four-network rotation to air the Primetime Emmy Awards , usually schedules the ceremony for the Sunday before Labor Day weekend , to avoid conflicts with '' SNF '' in mid-September ( when ABC , CBS , or Fox normally air the ceremony ) . NBC 's ideal date on the 2014 calendar for the ceremony ( Sunday , August 24 ) led to the other scheduling factor — MTV 's Video Music Awards , which were set for that night more than a year in advance ( and would be staged in the L.A. area as well , at The Forum in Inglewood ) . On January 28 , 2014 , rather than go head-to-head with the VMA 's , NBC announced that the ceremony would take place on Monday , August 25 . The move would allow NBC to commit to a preseason '' Sunday Night Football '' broadcast for the 24th ( a game between the Cincinnati Bengals and Arizona Cardinals ) ; it also ensured the tradition of staging the Primetime Emmy Awards the weekend after the Creative Arts Emmy Awards ( that ceremony was already set for August 16 )

		CONTEXT=The Primetime Emmy Awards generally air in mid-September , on the Sunday before the official start of the fall television season . They are currently seen in rotation among the four major networks ( ABC , CBS , FOX , NBC ) . The ceremony is typically moved to late-August if it is broadcast by NBC ( such as in 2006 , 2010 , and 2014 ) , so that it does not conflict with NBC 's commitment to broadcasting Sunday-night NFL games ( due to another conflict , this time with the MTV Video Music Awards , the 2014 ceremony was also shifted to a Monday ) . However , the 2018 ceremony , broadcast by NBC , was moved back to September and aired on a Monday

		CONTEXT=The ceremony was held on a night other than Sunday for the first time since 1976 ( the 28th Primetime Emmy Awards were also staged on a Monday that year , May 17 ) . The ceremony 's unusual date — a Monday night in late August — was due to two factors , primary being NBC 's commitment to '' Sunday Night Football '' ; since acquiring the National Football League 's Sunday night game package in 2006 , NBC , when it is their turn in the four-network rotation to air the Primetime Emmy Awards , usually schedules the ceremony for the Sunday before Labor Day weekend , to avoid conflicts with '' SNF '' in mid-September ( when ABC , CBS , or Fox normally air the ceremony ) . NBC 's ideal date on the 2014 calendar for the ceremony ( Sunday , August 24 ) led to the other scheduling factor — MTV 's Video Music Awards , which were set for that night more than a year in advance ( and would be staged in the L.A. area as well , at The Forum in Inglewood ) . On January 28 , 2014 , rather than go head-to-head with the VMA 's , NBC announced that the ceremony would take place on Monday , August 25 . The move would allow NBC to commit to a preseason '' Sunday Night Football '' broadcast for the 24th ( a game between the Cincinnati Bengals and Arizona Cardinals ) ; it also ensured the tradition of staging the Primetime Emmy Awards the weekend after the Creative Arts Emmy Awards ( that ceremony was already set for August 16 )

		CONTEXT=In a contemporary review for '' The Village Voice '' , Robert Christgau applauded Sade 's " taste , concept , sound " , and avoidance of indulgent musicianship , arguing that these qualities enhanced the " humanitarian " themed songs . The range of both the singer 's " grainy voice " and " well-meaning songwriting " was questioned by Christgau , who found " Hang On to Your Love " and " Smooth Operator " more " warming " than " seductive " and incapable of sustaining the rest of the album . Lynn Van Matre from the '' Chicago Tribune '' deemed the record " casual cocktail-lounge elegance " , performed " with far more style than substance " . Connie Johnson of the '' Los Angeles Times '' said " there 's an earthy substance to some of the cuts -- not much substance , but enough to draw you back for another listen " , while crediting Sade for knowing how to " clamp personal style onto recycled R&B idioms and make it all look invitingly new " . Paul Lester was more enthusiastic in a retrospective review for BBC Music , crediting Sade for her ability to write " songs that were sufficiently soulful and jazzy yet poppy , funky yet easy listening , to appeal to fans of all those genres " . Paul Evans called '' Diamond Life '' a " victory of attitude " in '' The Rolling Stone Album Guide '' ( 1992 ) , writing that Sade " projects a wised-up sensuality , and the record neither creaks with the revivalism of Harry Connick nor the sterility of Simply Red , to name but two of Sade 's neo-cocktail rivals . " '' Diamond Life '' was voted the 14th best album of the year in the 1985 Pazz & Jop , an annual poll of American critics , published by '' The Village Voice '' ; " Smooth Operator " was voted 25th in the singles poll . The album also won the 1985 Brit Award for the Best British Album .

		CONTEXT=Michael Cohl is a Canadian concert promoter , theatrical producer and touring impresario . He is the former Chairman of Live Nation . Cohl now runs S2BN Entertainment , with offices in New York and Toronto . Having been named the Howard Hughes of rock ‘ n ’ roll by '' Fortune '' magazine , Cohl is most famous for having overseen the tours and related ancillary businesses for more than 150 artists , including Frank Sinatra , Michael Jackson , The Rolling Stones , Prince , Stevie Wonder , Pink Floyd , Crosby , Stills , Nash and Young and U2 . He has also been credited with developing the concept of " package " touring . Eliminating the middleman , Cohl worked directly with the artist to strategize and route the tour , promote the dates , and assist in the development and exploitation of the lucrative aftermarket – books , films , DVDs , television specials , and merchandising . He is currently the lead producer of '' Spider-Man : Turn Off the Dark '' , the most expensive musical in Broadway history , with music by Bono and The Edge of U2 . In December 1995 , The Toronto Star printed a 4,000 word article entitled " King Cohl of Rock 'n' Roll and the Tax That Never Was . " From conversations with a number of managers of touring bands , the reporter argued that Cohl 's Concert Productions International misrepresented to touring artists that it was collecting a tax , while not remitting any such tax to any government body . The tax was a phoney tax Cohl added onto every ticket he sold at Toronto 's CNE Stadium . Fans paid an extra $ 3 per ticket for Springsteen , U2 , and Stones tickets . According to Canadian government auditors , that $ 3 per ticket added up to $ 5 million , all of which was pocketed by Cohl . He avoided jail time but had to sell back his BCL Entertainment Ltd stock to Labatt 's . Cohl was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame , when he received a Walt Grealis Special Achievement Award at the 2002 Juno Awards . Cohl is also a recipient of the 2004 Billboard Legend of Live award , an honour previously bestowed on such artists as Elton John and The Allman Brothers Band . When '' Spamalot '' won the 2005 Drama Desk and Tony Award for Best Musical , Cohl was among the producers who received the awards . He was inducted in Canada 's Walk of Fame in 2005 Cohl has produced several Broadway musicals as well as numerous other international touring shows . These include : CBC Television released a 2006 documentary directed by acclaimed filmmaker Barry Avrich as part of the '' Life and Times '' series chronicling Cohl 's rise to prominence in the entertainment industry . The film claims " When the Rolling Stones wo n’t make a move without talking to you first , your name must be Michael Cohl . " Mick Jagger , Keith Richards and Bono all make appearances

		CONTEXT=Three practice sessions were held before the Sunday race — two on Friday , and a third on Saturday . The Friday morning and afternoon sessions each lasted 90 minutes . The third session was held on Saturday morning and lasted an hour . The very first practice session on the newly opened Valencia Street Circuit was held on a dusty and slippery track , but despite the drivers ' relative unfamiliarity with the circuit there were no major incidents ( though David Coulthard did hit the barriers late in the session ) . Sébastien Bourdais went fastest early on , but it was his Toro Rosso teammate Sebastian Vettel who posted the quickest time of the session . Massa and Hamilton finished second and third , with Bourdais just behind them . Following the session , the drivers and personnel observed a minute 's silence for those killed in the plane crash in Madrid two days previously . Kimi Räikkönen topped the timesheets in second practice , having traded fastest times with teammate Massa for the majority of the session . Fernando Alonso had the set the quickest time late , but was surpassed by Räikkönen in his final flying lap . A notable incident in the session involved Nico Rosberg spinning under brakes in the final corners , and narrowly missing Mark Webber on the inside , before rejoining the track with no damage done . Surprsingly , usual back-runner Jenson Button , driving for Honda , finished third . After the session , Fernando Alonso , driving for Renault , was reprimanded and fined € 10,000 , after crossing the pitlane entry line early on in the second session . Rain overnight meant that the Valencia track began with almost no rubber on the surface , but Robert Kubica was still able to carry enough speed to become the first man of the weekend to break into the 1:38 s , with Rosberg and Bourdais close behind . There were minimal mishaps , with only Hamilton and Timo Glock spinning . Jarno Trulli spent the majority of the session in the pits with gearbox problems , completing only two laps

He characterized what he called the central syndrome of the cortex ( multisensory and bilateral disorder caused by a unilateral lesion in a parieto - occipital association area ) , which he interpreted based on physiological laws of nervous excitability and a model of brain dynamics where the cortex is conceived as a dynamic functional unit with specificity in gradation , providing a solution to the question of brain localization . He described and interpreted phenomena such as inverted perception and multisensory and motor facilitation , among others . By applying concepts of dynamic similarity , he formulated and proved potential allometric laws in the loss of functions and in the sensory organization . He belonged to the Spanish National Research Council ( CSIC ) from 1942 until his retirement , and he was lecturer of 21 PhD courses ( 1945 - 1966 ) on brain physiopathology at the Faculty of Medicine in the University of Madrid .

A heavily armed insurgent suicide squad occupied a six-story , half-built tower block , and began firing small arms and RPGs on nearby buildings including the British and German embassies . SBS operators and Afghan troops fought a close quarters battle for eight-and-a-half hours to eventually clear the militants from the structure .

A combat assault dog , a Belgian Malinois known as Mali , received the Dickin Medal for his actions during the battle . Despite being badly injured by grenade shrapnel , Mali stayed by the side of his handler and continued to find safe routes for the British and Afghan troops as they fought their way up the tower floor-by-floor , preventing the operators from suffering major casualties . On 23 December 2013 , Captain Richard Holloway was serving with the SBS when he was killed by Taliban small arms fire while conducting an operation to suppress the Taliban in a joint SBS-Afghan forces raid ( with air support ) on Taliban insurgents in a valley east of Kabul ahead of the Afghanistan elections

		CONTEXT=The Elmasry affair led to criticisms that the media focussed entirely on the comments of the CIC president while neglecting controversial comments made on the same program by a B'nai Brith official , Adam Aptowitzer , who stated that " When Israel uses terror ... to destroy a home and convince people ... to be terrified of what the possible consequences are , I 'd say that 's an acceptable use to terrify somebody . " The remarks only received attention several weeks after the broadcast , and after Elmasry 's apology and proffered resignation , when a press release by the Canadian Arab Federation highlighted them . Following the CAF press release , Aptowitzer retracted his comments and resigned his position with the B'nai Brith . '' Toronto Star '' city editor John Ferri told the '' Toronto Star '' 's ombud , Don Sellar , " we all had egg on our faces ... i t was embarrassing for every paper in the city not to get the whole story from the outset . " In a letter to the '' Toronto Star '' following Sellar 's column , Elmasary complained about the affair : Canadian news media - including the Star - launched a relentless and unfair attack against the Canadian Islamic Congress ( CIC ) and me while covering up for weeks the outrageous statements made on the same show by Adam Aptowitzer , then the Ontario chairman of the B'nai Brith Institute of International Affairs . While never referring to Aptowitzer 's statements , the media used news stories , editorials , op-ed pieces , columns , photos , front-page coverage , cartoons , and radio and television commentaries to paint a negative picture of CIC and myself which seriously distorts and falsifies the truth . It was widely reported , for example , that " Elmasry said all Israelis over 18 were legitimate targets for suicide bombers . " This is totally false . The media never questioned the completeness or the accuracy of the radio show transcript that was given to them . Instead , they totally and completely relied on the heavily selective one provided to them , which was one-sided and referred only to my remarks , but not to those by Aptowitzer . Elmasry also criticized Canadian Jewish groups over this incident . In an article entitled " When Jews Target a Canadian Muslim " , Elmasry accused the Canadian Jewish Congress ( CJC ) and Bnai Brith Canada of " putting pressure on my university to fire me " and that his words were " mis-represented to the public exactly as the CJC wished " . He also stated that " a Toronto Jewish businessman had threatened to withdraw his financial support for a chair of Jewish studies . " He also criticized the 2004 bombings of hotels in Taba , Egypt on the grounds that some of the victims there were not Israelis . These remarks prompted harshly-worded responses from representatives of the Canadian Jewish Congress and several prominent Canadian Muslims . At first , Elmasry defended his remarks by insisting that he was merely sharing the standard Palestinian point of view . This led to further charges from his critics , who accused him of using the Palestinians as a scapegoat . In a letter to the '' Toronto Star '' , he denied having said what he was reported to have said

QUERY_CONTEXT='' The Lovers '' was produced by Paul Breuls ' Corsan NV , Dale G. Bradley 's Limelight International Media Entertainment , Wei Han 's Bliss Media and co-financed by Ajey Jhankar 's Neelmudra Entertainment . Sales outfit Corsan World Sales , a division of Corsan NV , is handling international sales . Previously known as '' The Invaders '' , the film was in works from the late 1990s and was due originally to feature Hollywood actors Brendan Fraser and Neve Campbell and Bollywood actors Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Vivek Oberoi . The Anglo-Indian historical romance is Bipasha Basu 's first English language film . She was encouraged to take up her international debut by Oscar-winning actress Hilary Swank . Basu first met up with Swank at the New Seven Wonders of the World Official Declaration ceremony convened in Lisbon in 2007 and met her again at the 2011 International Indian Film Academy Awards in Toronto . Though originally planned for shooting partly in the United Kingdom , production began in Queensland , Australia , on 8 November 2010 . It concluded there on the third week of December 2010 . The production then moved to India on 31 March 2011 for a further five weeks , roaming the rocky terrain of Chambal , Orchha and Gwalior in the state of Madhya Pradesh . Principal photography wrapped on 23 April 2011 . The film was planned to premiere at the 65th annual Cannes International Film Festival in May 2012 , but in late 2011 the production company was placed in administration and all further filming was stopped when some ten percent remained . In June 2012 , Belgian-based financing and production outfit Corsan agreed to put further money into the production , and the final scenes were to be shot in London . In September 2012 , it was reported that the filming in London was finished , while some creditors were still waiting for payment .
