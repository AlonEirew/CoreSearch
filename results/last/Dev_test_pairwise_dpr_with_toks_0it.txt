QUERY_ANSWERS={'Johnstown Flood of 1977', '1977 flood', 'massive flood'}
QUERY_CONTEXT=The flood was preceded by rains from March 9 that did not stop until March 22 , 1936 . The storms brought warmer 50 °F ( 10 °C ) weather that was a cause of one stage of flooding and the continuous rains a second cause of flooding . The natural run-off of 1 to 3 inches ( 2.5 to 7.5 cm ) was far surpassed by the deluge of from 10 to 30 inches ( 25 to 75 cm ) of water in the region . The flood came before pending flood control legislation was enacted or any significant flood control measures implemented . The narrowness of the valleys and encroachment of buildings on the river banks contributed to record flooding . By the time nightfall came one-third of the city was under of water and by the time flooding was over twenty-five people lost their lives . The damages , estimated at $ 43 million , made it the worst flood since the flood of 1889 and the event is chronicled at the Johnstown Flood Museum After the flood , sweeping nationwide flood control laws were enacted and from 1938 to 1943 Johnstown saw many projects completed . These measures gave the people the feeling that the area was now " flood free " , and it was touted as such until the flood of 1977

		CONTEXT=Stinkfoot , a Comic Opera is an English musical with book , music , and lyrics by Vivian Stanshall and Ki Longfellow - Stanshall written for the Crackpot Theatre Company aboard the Old Profanity Showboat in Bristol , England . The show is based on a series of tales written by Longfellow about Stinkfoot , a New York City alley cat , a bit of a rogue and more than a bit of a rake . It had been intended for children , but when told by a New York City literary agent that " No mother in America would want her child identifying with Stinkfoot the alley cat , never mind its name , " the story went into a drawer for many years . It came out with the meeting in 1977 of Vivian and Ki , at which point the story became bedtime reading for Vivian 's son Rupert Stanshall ( born 1968 ) , and later for his daughter with Ki , Silky Longfellow - Stanshall ( born 1979 ) .

		CONTEXT=Since the early 2000s , Sinai has been the site of several terror attacks against tourists , the majority of whom are Egyptian . Investigations have shown that these were mainly motivated by a resentment of the poverty faced by many Bedouin in the area . Attacking the tourist industry was viewed as a method of damaging the industry so that the government would pay more attention to their situation . ( See 2004 Sinai bombings , 2005 Sharm El Sheikh bombings and 2006 Dahab bombings ) . Since the 2011 Egyptian Revolution , unrest has become more prevalent in the area including the 2012 Egyptian-Israeli border attack in which 16 Egyptian soldiers were killed by militants . ( See Sinai insurgency . ) Also on the rise are kidnappings of refugees . According to Meron Estifanos , Eritrean refugees are often kidnapped by Bedouin in the northern Sinai , tortured , raped , and only released after receiving a large ransom

QUERY_CONTEXT=In the 1959 review for '' Sight & Sound '' , David Vaughan calls '' Gigi '' " an elegant film " with a " cultivated visual taste which is everywhere apparent " . He summarises that " while '' Gigi '' does not represent a revival of the MGM musical in its heyday , it is a welcome extension of latter-day musical style in its adult subject-matter and its avoidance of spectacle made vulgar by emphasis on size . " He praises Minnelli 's talent for " the delicious amorality of the anecdote , but also the honesty and irony of its telling which have become foreign to the American cinema . " Vaughan points out " Chevalier 's practiced but irresistible charm as one of the film 's greatest assets " as well as " the brilliant high-comedy playing of Isabel Jeans , who as Aunt Alicia consummately portrays the distinction and beauty of a retired aristocrat of the '' demimonde '' . " Bosley Crowther of '' The New York Times '' called it " a musical film that bears such a basic resemblance to '' My Fair Lady '' that the authors may want to sue themselves " . He added , " But do n't think this point of resemblance is made in criticism of the film , for '' Gigi '' is a charming entertainment that can stand on its own two legs . It is not only a charming comprehension of the spicy confection of Colette , but it is also a lovely and lyrical enlargement upon that story 's flavored mood and atmosphere … Vincente Minnelli has marshaled a cast to give a set of performances that , for quality and harmony , are superb . " Abel Green of '' Variety '' called the film " 100 % escapist fare " and predicted it " is destined for a global box-office mop-up " . He added , " Alan Jay Lerner 's libretto is tailor-made for an inspired casting job for all principals , and Fritz Loewe 's tunes ( to Lerner 's lyrics ) already vie with and suggest their memorable '' My Fair Lady '' score … Miss Caron is completely captivating and convincing in the title role … Skillful casting , performance and presentation have endowed realism to the sum total … Director Minnelli 's good taste in keeping it in bounds and the general sound judgment of all concerned … distinguishes this Arthur Freed independent production . The Metrocolor rates recognition for its soft pastels under Joseph Ruttenberg 's lensing ; the Beaton costumes , sets and general production design are vivid physical assets at first sight . The skillful integration of words-and-music with the plot motivation makes this '' Gigi '' a very fair lady indeed as a boxoffice entry . " '' Time Out New York '' said , " The dominating creative contribution comes from Minnelli and Cecil Beaton … The combination of these two visual elitists is really too much — it 's like a meal consisting of cheesecake , and one quickly longs for something solid and vulgar to weigh things down . No doubt inspired by the finicky , claustrophobic sets and bric-à-brac , the cast tries ( with unfortunate success ) to be more French than the French , especially Chevalier . The exception is Gingold , who inhabits , as always , a world of her own .

		CONTEXT=The show received a mixed reception from media publications . On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes , the show holds an approval rating of 43 % based on 30 critics , and summarized , " The 90th Academy Awards played it safe and hit no major snags -- but by clocking in at over four hours , returning host Jimmy Kimmel and company wore out their welcome long before the surprise ending . " Hank Stuever of '' The Washington Post '' marked , " In his second year , Kimmel has shown that the telecast need n't be anything but sharp and sure , with a funny host whose bits are manageable , shareable and – best of all – forgotten . We 're not making showbiz history here ; we 're just trying to get through another Oscar night . " Chief critic David Edelstein of '' Vulture '' wrote , " This was the best , most inspiring , and most sheerly likable Academy Awards telecast I 've ever seen . ... It was also – in terms of the actual awards – among the most disappointing . " '' Vanity Fair '' s , Richard Lawson wrote , " As a host , Kimmel struck a careful , appropriately measured tone ... All told , Sunday 's ceremony did an admirable job of recognizing all the turmoil surrounding it while maintaining the silly , chintzy trappings that so many of us tune into the Oscars for . " CNN 's Brian Lowry quipped , " The Oscars are a big , unwieldy beast , which invariably try to serve too many masters . Yet if the intent was ultimately to maintain a celebratory tone without ignoring either the outside world or the elephant in the room throughout this year 's awards , host Jimmy Kimmel and the show itself largely succeeded . " Others were more critical of the show . Television critic Maureen Ryan of '' Variety '' said , " All things considered , the show had a more or less low-key vibe . Normally it takes about two hours for the numbing effect to set in , but despite host Jimmy Kimmel 's best efforts , Sunday 's telecast started to feel a bit languid and low-energy far earlier . " Television critic James Poniewozik of '' The New York Times '' said , " despite the recent upheaval in Hollywood , the ceremony at large still focused mainly on celebration and glitter literally , in the case of the blinding set , which looked as if the ceremony were encased in an enormous geode . There 's also the perennial problem of bloat . The hitch , of course , is that every part of the show has its constituency . " Darren Franich of '' Entertainment Weekly '' wrote , " What fun we had at this year 's Oscars ! Long show , sure , but where to cut it ? " Writing for '' Deadline '' Greg Evans said , " Did the nearly four-hour running time contain any moments for the Oscar ages ? Probably not . " David Wiegand of the '' San Francisco Chronicle '' wrote , " Even the hope that the noise of clapping might keep the audience at home and in the theater awake , there was little of that for anything except the entrance of actors of advance age . " '' The Oregonian '' columnist Kristi Turnquist wrote , " Was it respectful ? Absolutely . Did it make for kind of a dull , earnest Oscars show ? Yeah , kind of . " Attaining 26.5 million U.S. viewers according to Nielsen ratings , the ceremony 's telecast had a 16-percent drop in viewership from last year 's ceremony and had the lowest U.S. viewership in Oscar history . On March 6 , after the final ratings were confirmed , President Donald Trump took to his Twitter account , saying , " Lowest rated Oscars in HISTORY . Problem is , we do n't have stars anymore – except your President ( just kidding , of course ) ! " . In response , Kimmel also tweeted , saying , " Thanks , lowest rated President in HISTORY .

		CONTEXT=The show received a mixed reception from media publications . On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes , the show holds an approval rating of 43 % based on 30 critics , and summarized , " The 90th Academy Awards played it safe and hit no major snags -- but by clocking in at over four hours , returning host Jimmy Kimmel and company wore out their welcome long before the surprise ending . " Hank Stuever of '' The Washington Post '' marked , " In his second year , Kimmel has shown that the telecast need n't be anything but sharp and sure , with a funny host whose bits are manageable , shareable and – best of all – forgotten . We 're not making showbiz history here ; we 're just trying to get through another Oscar night . " Chief critic David Edelstein of '' Vulture '' wrote , " This was the best , most inspiring , and most sheerly likable Academy Awards telecast I 've ever seen . ... It was also – in terms of the actual awards – among the most disappointing . " '' Vanity Fair '' s , Richard Lawson wrote , " As a host , Kimmel struck a careful , appropriately measured tone ... All told , Sunday 's ceremony did an admirable job of recognizing all the turmoil surrounding it while maintaining the silly , chintzy trappings that so many of us tune into the Oscars for . " CNN 's Brian Lowry quipped , " The Oscars are a big , unwieldy beast , which invariably try to serve too many masters . Yet if the intent was ultimately to maintain a celebratory tone without ignoring either the outside world or the elephant in the room throughout this year 's awards , host Jimmy Kimmel and the show itself largely succeeded . " Others were more critical of the show . Television critic Maureen Ryan of '' Variety '' said , " All things considered , the show had a more or less low-key vibe . Normally it takes about two hours for the numbing effect to set in , but despite host Jimmy Kimmel 's best efforts , Sunday 's telecast started to feel a bit languid and low-energy far earlier . " Television critic James Poniewozik of '' The New York Times '' said , " despite the recent upheaval in Hollywood , the ceremony at large still focused mainly on celebration and glitter literally , in the case of the blinding set , which looked as if the ceremony were encased in an enormous geode . There 's also the perennial problem of bloat . The hitch , of course , is that every part of the show has its constituency . " Darren Franich of '' Entertainment Weekly '' wrote , " What fun we had at this year 's Oscars ! Long show , sure , but where to cut it ? " Writing for '' Deadline '' Greg Evans said , " Did the nearly four-hour running time contain any moments for the Oscar ages ? Probably not . " David Wiegand of the '' San Francisco Chronicle '' wrote , " Even the hope that the noise of clapping might keep the audience at home and in the theater awake , there was little of that for anything except the entrance of actors of advance age . " '' The Oregonian '' columnist Kristi Turnquist wrote , " Was it respectful ? Absolutely . Did it make for kind of a dull , earnest Oscars show ? Yeah , kind of . " Attaining 26.5 million U.S. viewers according to Nielsen ratings , the ceremony 's telecast had a 16-percent drop in viewership from last year 's ceremony and had the lowest U.S. viewership in Oscar history . On March 6 , after the final ratings were confirmed , President Donald Trump took to his Twitter account , saying , " Lowest rated Oscars in HISTORY . Problem is , we do n't have stars anymore – except your President ( just kidding , of course ) ! " . In response , Kimmel also tweeted , saying , " Thanks , lowest rated President in HISTORY . " In July 2018 , the ceremony presentation received eight nominations for the 70th Primetime Creative Arts Emmys

		CONTEXT=The show received a mixed reception from media publications . On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes , the show holds an approval rating of 43 % based on 30 critics , and summarized , " The 90th Academy Awards played it safe and hit no major snags -- but by clocking in at over four hours , returning host Jimmy Kimmel and company wore out their welcome long before the surprise ending . " Hank Stuever of '' The Washington Post '' marked , " In his second year , Kimmel has shown that the telecast need n't be anything but sharp and sure , with a funny host whose bits are manageable , shareable and – best of all – forgotten . We 're not making showbiz history here ; we 're just trying to get through another Oscar night . " Chief critic David Edelstein of '' Vulture '' wrote , " This was the best , most inspiring , and most sheerly likable Academy Awards telecast I 've ever seen . ... It was also – in terms of the actual awards – among the most disappointing . " '' Vanity Fair '' s , Richard Lawson wrote , " As a host , Kimmel struck a careful , appropriately measured tone ... All told , Sunday 's ceremony did an admirable job of recognizing all the turmoil surrounding it while maintaining the silly , chintzy trappings that so many of us tune into the Oscars for . " CNN 's Brian Lowry quipped , " The Oscars are a big , unwieldy beast , which invariably try to serve too many masters . Yet if the intent was ultimately to maintain a celebratory tone without ignoring either the outside world or the elephant in the room throughout this year 's awards , host Jimmy Kimmel and the show itself largely succeeded . " Others were more critical of the show . Television critic Maureen Ryan of '' Variety '' said , " All things considered , the show had a more or less low-key vibe . Normally it takes about two hours for the numbing effect to set in , but despite host Jimmy Kimmel 's best efforts , Sunday 's telecast started to feel a bit languid and low-energy far earlier . " Television critic James Poniewozik of '' The New York Times '' said , " despite the recent upheaval in Hollywood , the ceremony at large still focused mainly on celebration and glitter literally , in the case of the blinding set , which looked as if the ceremony were encased in an enormous geode . There 's also the perennial problem of bloat . The hitch , of course , is that every part of the show has its constituency . " Darren Franich of '' Entertainment Weekly '' wrote , " What fun we had at this year 's Oscars ! Long show , sure , but where to cut it ? " Writing for '' Deadline '' Greg Evans said , " Did the nearly four-hour running time contain any moments for the Oscar ages ? Probably not . " David Wiegand of the '' San Francisco Chronicle '' wrote , " Even the hope that the noise of clapping might keep the audience at home and in the theater awake , there was little of that for anything except the entrance of actors of advance age . " '' The Oregonian '' columnist Kristi Turnquist wrote , " Was it respectful ? Absolutely . Did it make for kind of a dull , earnest Oscars show ? Yeah , kind of . " Attaining 26.5 million U.S. viewers according to Nielsen ratings , the ceremony 's telecast had a 16-percent drop in viewership from last year 's ceremony and had the lowest U.S. viewership in Oscar history . On March 6 , after the final ratings were confirmed , President Donald Trump took to his Twitter account , saying , " Lowest rated Oscars in HISTORY . Problem is , we do n't have stars anymore – except your President ( just kidding , of course ) ! " . In response , Kimmel also tweeted , saying , " Thanks , lowest rated President in HISTORY . " In July 2018 , the ceremony presentation received eight nominations for the 70th Primetime Creative Arts Emmys

At the time of the arrival of the Europeans in 1492 , Yaguana — modern-day Léogâne — was the capital of Jaragua , one of the five chiefdoms on the island of Hispaniola . This province was the last independent holdout during the Spanish conquest of Hispaniola until their leader Queen Anacaona was captured and killed by the Spaniards in 1503 . The French secured legal access to one-third of the island from the Spanish crown by the Treaty of Ryswick in 1697 and established a city in Yaguana and renamed it Léogâne in 1711 . The town was destroyed in an earthquake in 1770 . In 1803 , during the Haitian Revolution Jean-Jacques Dessalines ordered his men to burn the town to the ground to force out the last of the French colonists

		CONTEXT=The Obice da 149/19 modello 37 was a heavy howitzer which served with Italy during World War II . It was intended to replace Italy 's assortment of World War I - era heavy howitzers , but this was prevented by the prolonged development time and the very slow pace of production . Despite orders totaling 1392 weapons only 147 had been built by September 1942 . There were three models , the 37 , 41 and 42 , differing only in details . The standard tractor was the Trattore SPA TM 40 . While an unremarkable design the Germans liked it enough to keep it in production with the designation of 15 cm sFH 404 ( i ) after the Italian surrender in 1943 . With the same weight it had superior range compared to the German 15 cm sFH 18 . It was used by the Italian army until 1974 .

However , the Greek Justice Minister refused to grant the required permission to enforce the judgment in Greece . In response , the plaintiffs attempted to enforce the judgment at the European Court of Human Rights and in the German courts , but were denied on grounds of state immunity . Finally , after the '' Ferrini '' decision , the plaintiffs petitioned for enforcement in Italy ; the Italian courts agreed to enforce the judgment and during 2007 the plaintiffs placed a legal charge on Villa Vigoni , a property in Italy owned by the German state

The book is believed to have been inspired by the village of Farsa , just outside Argostoli . The love story comprising the theme of the book is set before and after the Acqui Division massacre , during the Second World War . A film adaptation was released in 2001 . During filming there was lively debate between the production team , local authorities as well as groups of citizens , as to the complex historical details of the island 's antifascist resistance . As a result , political references were omitted from the film , and the romantic core of the book was preserved , without entering complex debates about the island 's history . In 2005 , Riccardo Milani made his TV movie , '' Cefalonia '' , also about the massacre , with music by Ennio Morricone

		CONTEXT='' The Philadelphia Inquirer '' published a review by Carrie Rickey , who wrote , " Under the obvious influence of Francis Ford Coppola , Bouchareb frames his shadow-ridden guerrilla heroes as the Algerian counterparts of the Corleones " , referring to the American film '' The Godfather '' , and further that '' Outside the Law '' owes " an enormous debt to Jean-Pierre Melville 's '' Army of Shadows '' ( 1969 ) , about French resistance fighters one-minded in their goal to subvert Nazis " . Rickey wrote , " Bouchareb is sometimes a little too one-minded : His movie might have been richer emotionally had he written scenes showing the characters ' domestic lives and not strictly their professional spheres . " Stephen Holden of '' The New York Times '' called '' Outside the Law '' a " didactic , unashamedly manipulative film " , and also saw parallels to '' The Godfather '' and '' Army of Shadows '' : " Those are mighty shoes to fill , and as powerful and well-made as it is , '' Outside the Law '' is too schematic and single-minded to lodge itself in your mind as a fully realized cinematic epic . Its few female characters are sketchy at best . " Before the film premiered , already it was met by political controversy and nationalist-oriented criticism in France . Lionnel Luca , a member of the National Assembly for the UMP , appealed for a review by the Defence Historical Service as soon as he heard about the project . Guy Pervillé deplored the inevitable acceptance by moviegoers of the film as representing historical truth . The Defence Historical Service claimed that " the errors and anachronisms are so many and so gross that they can be identified by any historian ... The numerous improbabilities present in the scenario show that the writing of the latter was not preceded by a serious historical study . " The center of the controversy was the depiction of the 1945 Sétif massacre early in the film . The report elaborated , " The director wants to suggest that on May 8 , 1945 , Muslims in Sétif were blindly massacred by Europeans , whereas it 's the contrary that transpired . ... A ll historians agree that ... Europeans lashed out against Muslims in response to Muslims massacring Europeans . " This reaction is at odds with mainstream history , which concluded that , after restoring order in the town , French military and police then carried out a series of reprisals and summary executions of native civilians . Before even seeing the film , Luca also criticized the decision to give public funding to a film which he considered " anti-French " . Mustapha Orif , one of the film 's co-producers , responded to the accusations and defended the film 's portrayal of the massacre . " Rachid Bouchareb interviewed many people , witnesses and historians . From this point of view , I do not think at all that he has deviated from historical reality , " he said

' Jonathan is too much a part of us to replace him . " Geary repeated these sentiments when Jackson confirmed leaving in 1999 .

But I do n't really get surprised with a lot of things that they do . " The role was recast with Jacob Young , and by the time he appeared on-screen in February 2000 , the character had been off-screen for almost a year , speculated to be an attempt to ease the transition between actors due to Jackson 's popularity . Young was able to become accepted by fans ; in 2001 , Candace Havens wrote in '' The Free Lance – Star '' : " His hard work has paid off and many fans ca n't even remember there was ever someone else in the role .

At the start of 2008 , '' Zap2it '' named Vaughan No. 6 on their Top 10 Most Improved list , stating : " The gorgeous Mr. Vaughan plays angry and sexy very well .

		CONTEXT=New Regent Street is a pedestrian mall in Christchurch . Built as a private development in the early 1930s with 40 shops in Spanish Mission architectural style , it is one of the city 's major tourist attractions . Providing a number of small shops as a comprehensive development was an advanced idea at the time , and New Regent Street is regarded as a forerunner to modern shopping malls . Due to its coherent architectural character , the buildings in the streets are listed as Category I heritage items by Heritage New Zealand , and in addition , the entire street has a historic area listing . The street was pedestrianised in 1994 in preparation for the introduction of the Christchurch heritage tram , which began operation in February 1995 . Damaged in the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake , the street and buildings reopened in April 2013 , and the tram returned from November of that year . Following the 2016 Valentine 's Day earthquake , five of the buildings that had not been repaired after the previous earthquakes have been cordoned off , which stopped the tram from operating on its original heritage loop until May

However the IAF added similar equipment produced indigenously to the aircraft after delivery . In October 2011 , India announced its intent to exercise the option for the six additional aircraft , following the C-130J 's favorable performance in the 2011 Sikkim earthquake relief operations . In July 2012 , the U.S. accepted India 's request for the six more C-130Js through the FMS program . On 20 December 2013 , India 's CCS approved the order for 6 more aircraft

		CONTEXT=Marc Lamont Hill , a professor at Columbia University , compared the fugitive ex – Los Angeles police officer Christopher Dorner to a real-life Django , saying " It 's almost like watching ' Django Unchained ' in real life . It 's kind of exciting . " Writing in the '' Los Angeles Times '' , journalist Erin Aubry Kaplan noted the difference between Tarantino 's '' Jackie Brown '' and '' Django Unchained '' : " It is an institution whose horrors need no exaggerating , yet '' Django '' does exactly that , either to enlighten or entertain . A white director slinging around the n-word in a homage to '70s blaxploitation à la '' Jackie Brown '' is one thing , but the same director turning the savageness of slavery into pulp fiction is quite another . " While hosting NBC 's '' Saturday Night Live '' , Jamie Foxx joked about being excited " to kill all the white people in the movie " . Conservative columnist Jeff Kuhner wrote a reaction to the '' SNL '' skit for '' The Washington Times '' , saying : " Anti-white bigotry has become embedded in our postmodern culture . Take '' Django Unchained '' . The movie boils down to one central theme : the white man as devil — a moral scourge who must be eradicated like a lethal virus . " Samuel L. Jackson told Vogue Man that " '' Django Unchained '' was a harder and more detailed exploration of what the slavery experience was than '' 12 Years a Slave '' , but director Steve McQueen is an artist and since he 's respected for making supposedly art films , it 's held in higher esteem than '' Django '' , because that was basically a blaxploitation movie . " Some reviews criticized the film for being too violent . The originally planned premiere of '' Django '' was postponed following the Sandy Hook school shooting on December 14 , 2012 . Thomas Frank criticized the film 's use of violence as follows : Not surprisingly , Quentin Tarantino has lately become the focus for this sort of criticism ( about the relationship between the movies and acts of violence ) . The fact that '' Django Unchained '' arrived in theaters right around the time of the Sandy Hook massacre did n't help . Yet he has refused to give an inch in discussing the link between movie violence and real life . Obviously I do n't think one has to do with the other . Movies are about make-believe . It 's about imagination . Part of the thing is trying to create a realistic experience , but we are faking it . Is it possible that anyone in our cynical world credits a self-serving sophistry like this ? Of course an industry under fire will claim that its hands are clean , just as the NRA has done – and of course a favorite son , be it Tarantino or LaPierre , can be counted on to make the claim louder than anyone else . But do they really believe that imaginative expression is without consequence ? '' The Independent '' said the movie was part of " the new sadism in cinema " and added , " There is something disconcerting about sitting in a crowded cinema as an audience guffaws at the latest garroting or falls about in hysterics as someone is beheaded or has a limb lopped off "

		CONTEXT=The film received positive reviews and response from both the critics and audience . Rachit Gupta from '' Filmfare '' gave the film a rating of 4.5 / 5 , stating , " SS Rajamouli 's much-awaited sequel is the kind of movie Indian cinema should make regularly . It 's the kind of sweeping magnum opus that Indian mythos and culture deserve . It 's the biggest film we have ever made and barring a few minor glitches in CGI , this film is possibly the greatest spectacle you 'll see on a big screen , in your life . " Sangeetha Devi Dundoo from '' The Hindu '' stated , " For the most part , The Conclusion does n't let us take our eyes off the screen . It 's designed to be a cinematic celebration , one that deserves to be watched on the largest screen possible " . Anupama Subramanian of the '' Deccan Chronicle '' gave the film a 3.5 / 5 , praising the acting of the stars while complaining about " the lack of a solid plot ' and called the ending " predictable . " Vishnuprasad Pillai of '' Asianet News '' gave a negative review , writing that the film " offers nothing new ... The writing from KV Vijayendra Prasad fails inspire or to do justice to an epic of such scale , " adding that " the dialogues at times are downright corny and plot developments cringe-worthy . " Dipanjan Sinha of '' Hindustan Times '' gave the film a rating of 3/5 stars , praising the film 's cinematography and special effects , but found faults with some of the female characters . Sinha stated , " Devasena ... starts off as an ace warrior only to be tamed into someone who has to be protected . " Shubhra Gupta of '' Indian Express '' rated the film 2/5 stars , noting problems with pacing and sound , writing , " The background music is relentless , and the pitch at which the declamatory dialogues are delivered is deafening : there were times I felt like closing my ears . " Taran Adarsh of '' Bollywood Hungama '' rates the film 4.5 out of 5 and praises the performance of the cast , writing , " It 's a feast for moviegoers and has the trappings to make all generations its fan . " Meena Iyer from '' The Times of India '' rated it 4/5 , writing : " Just savor it . It is a visual extravaganza that India must feast on ... Prabhas is terrific as father and son . Of course , it is CGI and VFX that grab you in your seat . " Hemanth Kumar from '' Firstpost '' called it " Rajamouli 's epic drama " and rated it 4/5 . Sukanya Verma from '' Rediff '' rated the film 3.5 / 5 , writing the film , " continues its tradition of grandiloquence and magnitude ... high drama , more than spectacle , is what lends its riveting tale of revenge and glory all its wallop and wizardry . " She also praised the film 's cast and director stating , " Equipped with a cast that 's not only in tune with Rajamouli 's vision but knows exactly where to hold back and when to give their all adds to Baahubali 's might . " It was further featured in Rotten Tomatoes ' list of Best Off the Radar Films of 2017 , in which Tim Ryan writes , " '' Baahubali 2 : The Conclusion '' plays like a shotgun wedding between '' Ben Hur '' and '' Kung Fu Hustle '' , seasoned with bits of Shakespeare , Kurosawa , and Buster Keaton , " opining , " it 's a blockbuster that 's both gigantic and lighter than air . " Mike McCahill of The Guardian gave a 4/5 rating and called it " a jaw-dropping blockbuster that combines nimble action with genuine heart " . He also stated , " This production 's triumph is the room it 's granted Rajamouli to head into the fields and dream up endlessly expressive ways to frame bodies in motion . Of the many sequences here primed to cut through jadedness , perhaps the most wondrous is that which finds Baahu guiding Deva mid-battle to shoot three arrows simultaneously – a set piece that speaks both to a love of action , and love in action . The budget 's big , the muscle considerable , but they 're nothing compared with '' Baahubali '' s heart . " Manjusha Radhakrishnan of '' Gulf News '' rates the film 3.5 out of 5 and writes , " This is a sweeping visual spectacle filled with epic battle scenes , clashes between warring troops from Indian mythology and elephants on a rampage , " but further added , " There were times in the second half where you felt the computer-generated graphics took over the story . But all this is new and exotic for Indian cinema . " Shilpa Jamkhandikar of '' Reuters '' writes , " It may not up the ante from the last film , but it does n't let up on the pace either . For an Indian film , that is no mean feat . " J Hurtado of '' ScreenAnarchy '' writes , " It 's a bit daunting because it does begin in media res immediately following the complex actions of the first film , but astute viewers will put together the pieces soon enough . " Kabita Maharana of '' International Business Times '' gave a rating of 4 out of 5 and writes , " From the very first scene , the film is a visual extravaganza . Every frame is meticulously captured by SS Rajamouli and his team . This is the first Indian film hailed for excelling in visual effects . " Simon Abrams of RogerEbert.com gave the film a 4/4 rating and writes the film " is everything I want but rarely get from superhero and big-budget fantasy movie " adding " the fight scenes ... are so creative that they make even the most frequently abused creative shortcuts seem novel , everything from computer-generated imagery ( CGI ) to speed-ramping ... You care what happens to the cast as they , aided by wires , hurl volleys of arrows at disposable minions and CGI animals . " Anita Iyer from '' Khaleej Times '' rates the film 3.5 out of 5 and writes , " What stands out in the film is the powerful star cast . Enough has been said already about the acting prowess of Prabhas but he has an equally supportive cast to hold the film . Ramya Krishna as Sivagami , is known for her impressive acting talent and proves her mettle here . Another veteran , Sathyaraj as Katappa excels and you develop a camaraderie with him . Rana Daggubati is aptly spiteful in his portrayal of the villain ... Nassar , as his father , is busy spewing venom but his role could have been meatier . " '' The Conclusion '' won the Telstra People 's Choice Award at the Indian Film Festival of Melbourne , sharing the prize with '' Dangal '' . Tamannaah Bhatia and K.V. Vijayendra Prasad won the Global Indian Impact Icon Award for '' The Conclusion '' at NRI of the Year Awards .

		CONTEXT=Later in 1979 , Sellers starred opposite Shirley MacLaine , Melvyn Douglas and Jack Warden in the black comedy '' Being There '' as Chance , a simple-minded gardener addicted to watching TV who is regarded as a sage by the rich and powerful . In a BBC interview in 1971 , Sellers had said that more than anything else , he wanted to play the role , and successfully persuaded the author of the book , Jerzy Kosinski , to allow him and director Hal Ashby to make the film , provided Kosinski could write the script . During filming , to remain in character , Sellers refused most interview requests and kept his distance from the other actors . Sellers considered Chance 's walking and voice the character 's most important attributes , and in preparing for the role worked alone with a tape recorder or with his wife , and then with Ashby , to perfect the clear enunciation and flat delivery needed to reveal " the childlike mind behind the words " . Sellers described his experience of working on the film as " so humbling , so powerful " , and co-star Shirley MacLaine found Sellers " a dream " to work with . Sellers 's performance was universally lauded by critics and is considered by critic Danny Smith to be the " crowning triumph of Peter Sellers 's remarkable career " . Critic Frank Rich wrote that the acting skill required for this sort of role , with a " schismatic personality that Peter had to convey with strenuous vocal and gestural technique ... A lesser actor would have made the character 's mental dysfunction flamboyant and drastic ... His intelligence was always deeper , his onscreen confidence greater , his technique much more finely honed " : in achieving this , Sellers " makes the film 's fantastic premise credible " . The film earned Sellers a Best Actor award at the 51st National Board of Review Awards ; the London Critics Circle Film Awards Special Achievement Award , the Best Actor award at the 45th New York Film Critics Circle Awards ; and the Best Actor – Musical or Comedy award at the 37th Golden Globe Awards . Additionally , Sellers was nominated for the Best Actor award at the 52nd Academy Awards and the Best Actor in a Leading Role award at the 34th British Academy Film Awards

		CONTEXT=Marc Lamont Hill , a professor at Columbia University , compared the fugitive ex – Los Angeles police officer Christopher Dorner to a real-life Django , saying " It 's almost like watching ' Django Unchained ' in real life . It 's kind of exciting . " Writing in the '' Los Angeles Times '' , journalist Erin Aubry Kaplan noted the difference between Tarantino 's '' Jackie Brown '' and '' Django Unchained '' : " It is an institution whose horrors need no exaggerating , yet '' Django '' does exactly that , either to enlighten or entertain . A white director slinging around the n-word in a homage to '70s blaxploitation à la '' Jackie Brown '' is one thing , but the same director turning the savageness of slavery into pulp fiction is quite another . " While hosting NBC 's '' Saturday Night Live '' , Jamie Foxx joked about being excited " to kill all the white people in the movie " . Conservative columnist Jeff Kuhner wrote a reaction to the '' SNL '' skit for '' The Washington Times '' , saying : " Anti-white bigotry has become embedded in our postmodern culture . Take '' Django Unchained '' . The movie boils down to one central theme : the white man as devil — a moral scourge who must be eradicated like a lethal virus . " Samuel L. Jackson told Vogue Man that " '' Django Unchained '' was a harder and more detailed exploration of what the slavery experience was than '' 12 Years a Slave '' , but director Steve McQueen is an artist and since he 's respected for making supposedly art films , it 's held in higher esteem than '' Django '' , because that was basically a blaxploitation movie . " Some reviews criticized the film for being too violent . The originally planned premiere of '' Django '' was postponed following the Sandy Hook school shooting on December 14 , 2012 . Thomas Frank criticized the film 's use of violence as follows : Not surprisingly , Quentin Tarantino has lately become the focus for this sort of criticism ( about the relationship between the movies and acts of violence ) . The fact that '' Django Unchained '' arrived in theaters right around the time of the Sandy Hook massacre did n't help . Yet he has refused to give an inch in discussing the link between movie violence and real life . Obviously I do n't think one has to do with the other . Movies are about make-believe . It 's about imagination . Part of the thing is trying to create a realistic experience , but we are faking it . Is it possible that anyone in our cynical world credits a self-serving sophistry like this ? Of course an industry under fire will claim that its hands are clean , just as the NRA has done – and of course a favorite son , be it Tarantino or LaPierre , can be counted on to make the claim louder than anyone else . But do they really believe that imaginative expression is without consequence ? '' The Independent '' said the movie was part of " the new sadism in cinema " and added , " There is something disconcerting about sitting in a crowded cinema as an audience guffaws at the latest garroting or falls about in hysterics as someone is beheaded or has a limb lopped off "

In previous years , countries that received a top 10 placing were automatically granted a spot in the next year 's final without having to compete in a semi-final , but for 2008 , the EBU changed the automatic qualification regulations so that all countries except the " Big 4 " ( France , Germany , Spain , and the United Kingdom ) and host country , would have to pass through one of two semi-finals . The EBU split up countries with a friendly voting history into separate semi-finals , to give a better chance for other countries to win . Greece and Cyprus had often been accused of favoring each other , with each awarding the other the maximum number of points ( twelve ) at the previous contest . On January 28 , 2008 , the EBU held a special draw which determined that Greece would be in '' Semi-final 1 '' held on May 20 , 2008 in Belgrade , Serbia ; Cyprus was subsequently placed in the second semi-final

		CONTEXT=Although Greece had been granted a spot in the 2008 final because of its seventh-place finish at the Eurovision Song Contest 2007 , it had to compete in a semi-final for the first time since 2004 because of new rules put into effect by the European Broadcasting Union ( EBU ) . In previous years , countries that received a top 10 placing were automatically granted a spot in the next year 's final without having to compete in a semi-final , but for 2008 , the EBU changed the automatic qualification regulations so that all countries except the " Big 4 " ( France , Germany , Spain , and the United Kingdom ) and host country , would have to pass through one of two semi-finals . The EBU split up countries with a friendly voting history into separate semi-finals , to give a better chance for other countries to win . Greece and Cyprus had often been accused of favoring each other , with each awarding the other the maximum number of points ( twelve ) at the previous contest . On January 28 , 2008 , the EBU held a special draw which determined that Greece would be in '' Semi-final 1 '' held on May 20 , 2008 in Belgrade , Serbia ; Cyprus was subsequently placed in the second semi-final

QUERY_CONTEXT=Duane Allman created the idea of having two lead guitarists , which was inspired by Curtis Mayfield ; " he wanted the bass , keyboards , and second guitar to form patterns behind the solo rather than just comping , " said Allman . Their style and incorporation of guitar harmonies was very influential on later musicians . " The pair also had a wide range of complementary techniques , often forming intricate , interlocking patterns with each other and with the bassist , Berry Oakley , setting the stage for dramatic flights of improvised melodies . " Dickey Betts ' playing was very melody-based ; " My style is just a little too smooth and round to play the blues stuff straight , because I 'm such a melody guy that even when I 'm playing the blues , I go for melody first , " he said . His listening of country and string bluegrass growing up influenced this considerably : " I played mandolin , ukulele , and fiddle before I ever touched a guitar , which may be where a lot of the major keys I play come from . " He later characterized their style as " question and answer , anticipation and conclusion , " which involved allowing each musician 's downbeat to arrive in a different spot , while also keeping consideration of the bass guitar lines . The group also held an improvisational approach to live performances , which connected the band with jam band culture . " Jazz and blues musicians have been doing this for decades , but I think they really brought that sense that anyone onstage can inspire anyone else at any given time to rock music , " said Haynes . " We sure did n't set out to be a " jam band " but those long jams just emanated from within the band , because we did n't want to just play three minutes and be over , " said Allman . '' Rolling Stone '' referred to the group as " without question the first great jam band , and they took the jam to heights that it had not previously reached . " The Allman Brothers Band were considerably influential within the Southern United States . Their arrival on the musical scene paved the way for several other notable Southern rock bands — among those Lynyrd Skynyrd , the Marshall Tucker Band and Wet Willie — to achieve commercial success , and also " almost single-handedly " made Capricorn Records into " a major independent label . " Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top , writing for '' Rolling Stone '' , wrote that the group " defined the best of every music from the American South in that time . They were the best of all of us . " He went on to call the band " a true brotherhood of players — one that went beyond race and ego . It was a thing of beauty . " The band 's extended popularity through heavy touring in the early 1990s created a new generation of fans , one that viewed the Allmans as pioneers of " latter-day collegiate jam rock . " AllMusic praised the band 's history : " they went from being America 's single most influential band to a shell of their former self trading on past glories , to reach the 21st century resurrected as one of the most respected rock acts of their era . " In 2012 , an official historic marker was erected on the site of the July 1970 Second Atlanta International Pop Festival near Byron , Georgia . The Allman Brothers Band had played two sets at the festival , which was a significant event in their career . The marker text reads , in part : " Over thirty musical acts performed , including ... Macon 's Allman Brothers Band on their launching pad to national fame . " Official sponsors of the marker included the Georgia Allman Brothers Band Association , The Allman Brothers Band Museum at the Big House , and '' Hittin ' the Note '' . In 2003 , the band released a recording of their festival opening and closing performances , '' Live at the Atlanta International Pop Festival : July 3 & 5 , 1970 ''

		CONTEXT=In a positive review for '' Cuepoint '' , Robert Christgau argued that while Azalea may never demonstrate a powerful , soulful , or attractively melodic delivery , her " striving Australian-Atlantan cadence " is original and carries every song . He deemed ' ' The New Classic '' " plenty authentic -- and damn good to boot " while dismissing Azalea 's media naysayers : " predictably , the songs where she expresses wonderment that ' Impossible Is Nothing ' are more relatable than the ones where she flaunts her liquid assets . But the ones where she pledges to keep on striving are more relatable than that , because striving is built into her flow itself . That 's what her complexity is about . " Phil Johnson from '' The Independent '' called it " an instantly engaging showcase of the 23-year-old Aussie 's talents – poppy without diluting her fierce-flowing charisma . " Kellan Miller of '' XXL '' said despite some poor songs near the end of the record , it is " a persuasive indicator that Iggy Azalea will be around for the long haul . " '' The New Classic '' was named one of the best hip-hop albums of the year by '' XXL '' on a list published on 30 June 2014 , adding that " the album proved to a gang of skepts who doubted Iggy 's controversial style from the start that she was more than capable of making hip-hop tracks with a pop appeal . " It was placed at number twenty-five on Digital Spy 's top albums of 2014 and listed among Fuse 's 40 best albums of 2014 . The album won the Breakthrough Artist Release award at the 2014 ARIA Music Awards and Favorite Rap/Hip-Hop Album at the 2014 American Music Awards , beating out Drake 's '' Nothing Was the Same '' and Eminem 's '' The Marshall Mathers LP 2 '' . It received a nomination for Best Rap Album at the 57th Grammy Awards . The album was also up for Top Rap Album at the 2015 Billboard Music Awards

He deemed ' ' The New Classic '' " plenty authentic -- and damn good to boot " while dismissing Azalea 's media naysayers : " predictably , the songs where she expresses wonderment that ' Impossible Is Nothing ' are more relatable than the ones where she flaunts her liquid assets . But the ones where she pledges to keep on striving are more relatable than that , because striving is built into her flow itself . That 's what her complexity is about . " Phil Johnson from '' The Independent '' called it " an instantly engaging showcase of the 23-year-old Aussie 's talents – poppy without diluting her fierce-flowing charisma . " Kellan Miller of '' XXL '' said despite some poor songs near the end of the record , it is " a persuasive indicator that Iggy Azalea will be around for the long haul . " '' The New Classic '' was named one of the best hip-hop albums of the year by '' XXL '' on a list published on 30 June 2014 , adding that " the album proved to a gang of skepts who doubted Iggy 's controversial style from the start that she was more than capable of making hip-hop tracks with a pop appeal . " It was placed at number twenty-five on Digital Spy 's top albums of 2014 and listed among Fuse 's 40 best albums of 2014 . The album won the Breakthrough Artist Release award at the 2014 ARIA Music Awards and Favorite Rap/Hip-Hop Album at the 2014 American Music Awards , beating out Drake 's '' Nothing Was the Same '' and Eminem 's '' The Marshall Mathers LP 2 '' . It received a nomination for Best Rap Album at the 57th Grammy Awards . The album was also up for Top Rap Album at the 2015 Billboard Music Awards

" The victims of the massacre were members of an indigenous-rights group known as Las Abejas ; however , the current president of that organization , Porfirio Arias , claims that the alleged victims were in fact not residents of Acteal at all .

According to Ibn al-Athir ( '' The Complete History '' , VII .370.5 – 7 ) , in AH 268 ( 881/82 CE ) , the Aghlabid commander Abū Ṯawr was defeated by the Byzantines ( probably commanded by the '' strategos '' Mosilikes ) and his was army annihilated , with only seven men surviving . The locality was later named in Arabic '' Qalʿat Abī Ṯawr '' ( " Castle of Abū Ṯawr " ) , which is the origin of the modern name . Others instead maintain that the name derives from the Arabic word " qal ' at " ( fortress ) and the Sicilian " vuturu " ( vulture ) meaning of " fortress of vultures . " The town existed under Byzantine rule pre Arab conquest as Aziz Ahmad in “ A Islamic History of Sicily ” ( edinburgh university press 1975 ) states that in 852 Abbas raided Caltavuturo in the northern part of the Island and took many prisoners who were sold as slaves , The town was the site of the so-called Caltavuturo massacre on 20 January 1893 , when local authorities killed 13 and wounded 21 peasants that had occupied communal land that they claimed was theirs

		CONTEXT=About Minoan warfare , Branigan concluded : Archaeologist Olga Krzyszkowska agreed : " The stark fact is that for the prehistoric Aegean we have no direct evidence for war and warfare '' per se '' . " Between 1935 and 1939 , Greek archaeologist Spyridon Marinatos posited the Minoan eruption theory . An eruption on the island of Thera ( present-day Santorini ) , about from Crete , occurred during the LM IA period ( 1550 – 1500 BC ) . One of the largest volcanic explosions in recorded history , it ejected about of material and was measured at 7 on the Volcanic Explosivity Index . The eruption devastated the nearby Minoan settlement at Akrotiri on Santorini , which was entombed in a layer of pumice . Although it is believed to have severely affected the Minoan culture of Crete , the extent of its effects has been debated . Early theories proposed that volcanic ash from Thera choked off plant life on the eastern half of Crete , starving the local population ; however , more-thorough field examinations have determined that no more than of ash fell anywhere on Crete . Based on archaeological evidence , studies indicate that a massive tsunami generated by the Thera eruption devastated the coast of Crete and destroyed many Minoan settlements . Although the LM IIIA ( late Minoan ) period is characterized by affluence ( wealthy tombs , burials and art ) and ubiquitous Knossian ceramic styles , by LM IIIB Knossos ' wealth and importance as a regional center apparently declined

		CONTEXT=Kleisoura ( , also Βλαχοκλεισούρα , '' Vlachokleisoúra '' ; ) is a traditionally Aromanian ( Vlach ) settlement and a former municipality in Kastoria regional unit , West Macedonia , Greece . Since the 2011 local government reform , it is part of the municipality of Kastoria , of which it is a municipal unit . The municipal unit has an area of 37.069 km2 . Population 259 ( 2011 ) . On 5 April 1944 , the German occupation forces under the command of Karl Schümers , commander of the 7th regiment of the 4th Armored Division of the SS , the same unit to later that year commit the massacre in Distomo , slaughtered the women and children of Kleisoura in retaliation for the execution of three German soldiers by ELAS close to the village . The ELAS guerrillas , led by Alexis Rosios from Siatisti ( " Captain Ypsilantis " ) , who were active in the region , had attacked a German military phalanx at Daouli , close to Kleisoura , and had killed a vanguard of three motorcyclists . According to testimonies , the male residents , fearing retaliation , fled to the mountains surrounding the village . After finding the mutilated bodies of the Wehrmacht soldiers close to the local church , the German SS unit went to the homes , broke the doors of the majority of the houses , shot the people within , set fire to the buildings and also killed whom they found in the streets . Altogether 270 residents were killed , the overwhelming majority of them being women , children and elderly people . Involved in the atrocities was also a Bulgarian militia under German command , led by Andon Kalchev . Colonel Karl Schümers was summoned by the German administration for having ordered the slaughter of women and children . He testified that his soldiers were forced to kill the civilians because rebel forces were hiding and firing through the village , whereupon he was acquitted , despite the contradictory statements of his subordinates . After the war it was proved that his testimony was false

In 2011 , the show won in the category again for the eighth time . After its seventh consecutive win , some in the media , including '' Survivor '' host Jeff Probst suggested that '' The Amazing Race '' willingly drop out from the competition in future years , similar to Candice Bergen declining any further nominations after her fifth Emmy win for her role in '' Murphy Brown '' . Van Munster has stated that it is " not likely " he will pull the show from future Emmy awards , considering that it reflects on his and his crew 's hard work and high standards . The show has also been nominated and won several times for technical production ( Creative Arts ) Emmy awards , for Cinematography and Picture Editing for Non-Fiction programs , whereas it has only been nominated for Sound Mixing and Sound Editing for Non-Fiction programs .

Its streak was ended in 2010 when '' Top Chef '' won the Emmy for this category . Host Phil Keoghan revealed in an interview that the show 's loss that year made him and the producers realize that they will have to try harder to win the Emmy again . In 2011 , the show won in the category again for the eighth time . After its seventh consecutive win , some in the media , including '' Survivor '' host Jeff Probst suggested that '' The Amazing Race '' willingly drop out from the competition in future years , similar to Candice Bergen declining any further nominations after her fifth Emmy win for her role in '' Murphy Brown '' . Van Munster has stated that it is " not likely " he will pull the show from future Emmy awards , considering that it reflects on his and his crew 's hard work and high standards . The show has also been nominated and won several times for technical production ( Creative Arts ) Emmy awards , for Cinematography and Picture Editing for Non-Fiction programs , whereas it has only been nominated for Sound Mixing and Sound Editing for Non-Fiction programs . The show has been nominated in the same five categories for three years consecutively , a trend which continued with the 2007 Primetime Emmy Awards

In the U.S. Presidential campaign of 1848 , Gibson supported Whig candidate , " Rough and Ready " General Zachary Taylor . However , he was concerned about the Whig Party 's lack of opposition to the abolition of slavery and personally visited Henry Clay at his home in Ashland , Kentucky in 1848 to discuss this issue . He lost as a Whig candidate for Ohio Attorney General in 1853 . In 1853 , following the large defeat of the Whig candidate General Winfield Scott in the U.S. Presidential election of 1852 , Gibson threw his support to the Free Soil Party and began organizing what would become the Republican Party in Ohio .

Resolved , That foregoing all former differences of opinions upon other questions , we pledge ourselves to unite in opposition to the present administration of the Government ; that under the Constitution Congress possesses the power to prohibit slavery in the Territories ; and that , whilst we will maintain all constitutional rights of the South , we also hold that justice , humanity , the principles of freedom as expressed in our Declaration of Independence and our national constitution , and the purity and perpetuity of our Government require that that power shall be exerted to prevent the extension of slavery into territory heretofore free . Resolved , That the repeal of the Missouri Compromise was unwise and injurious ; an open and aggravated violation of the plighted faith of the States , and that the attempt of the present administration to force slavery into Kansas against the known wishes of the legal voters of that Territory is an arbitrary and tyrannous violation of the rights of the people to govern themselves , and that we will strive by all constitutional means to secure to Kansas and Nebraska the legal guaranty against slavery of which they were deprived at the cost of the violation of the plighted faith of the nation . Resolved , That we are devoted to the Union and will , to the last extremity , defend it against the efforts now being made by the dis-unionists of this administration to compass its dissolution , and that we will support the Constitution of the United States , in all its provisions regarding it , as the sacred bond of our Union and the only safeguard for the preservation of the rights of ourselves and our posterity . Resolved , That we are in favor of the immediate admission of Kansas as a member of this Confederacy under the constitution adopted by the people of said Territory . Resolved , That the spirit of our institutions as well as the Constitution of our country , guarantees the liberty of conscience as well as political freedom , and that we will proscribe no one by legislation or otherwise on account of religious opinions , or in consequence of place of birth .

In one incident in the 2010 preseason he was removed from training and verbally reprimanded by club leadership when he was deemed unfit to train after a big night out . Despite these struggles , his on-field development was such that he would still debut in the 2010 season 's opening match , a 56-point Richmond loss against at the MCG . Martin recorded the sixth most disposals of any Tiger ( 18 ) to go along with four marks , three tackles and three clearances . Two weeks later Martin was convicted by the AFL tribunal for a high hit on Sydney 's Josh Kennedy in round 3 . He did not receive a suspension for the incident however , returning to football the following week . After four matches Martin ranked fourth in the league for clearances and eighth for hard-ball gets . Media reports emerged after round 8 that the 18 year old Martin had received a significant contract offer from expansion club the Greater Western Sydney Giants .

Despite this extra attention , he still managed to record 18 disposals and a goal in the match at the MCG .

In addition to winning the Fred Swift Medal for fourth place at the club 's best and fairest night , Martin also received six votes in the Brownlow Medal count that year , the most by any Richmond debutant since Craig Lambert in 1988 . At season 's end he reiterated his commitment to the club ( and rejection of the former GWS overtures ) by signing a two-year contract extension that would keep him at Richmond until the end of the 2013 season .

		CONTEXT=He arrived at the club as an incredibly shy and underdeveloped personality , a fact that was noted by teammate Trent Cotchin who said though Martin was 18 “ he seemed much younger in some of the ways he behaved . ” Indeed , he struggled initially to adjust to the expectations of professional football . In one incident in the 2010 preseason he was removed from training and verbally reprimanded by club leadership when he was deemed unfit to train after a big night out . Despite these struggles , his on-field development was such that he would still debut in the 2010 season 's opening match , a 56-point Richmond loss against at the MCG . Martin recorded the sixth most disposals of any Tiger ( 18 ) to go along with four marks , three tackles and three clearances . Two weeks later Martin was convicted by the AFL tribunal for a high hit on Sydney 's Josh Kennedy in round 3 . He did not receive a suspension for the incident however , returning to football the following week . After four matches Martin ranked fourth in the league for clearances and eighth for hard-ball gets . Media reports emerged after round 8 that the 18 year old Martin had received a significant contract offer from expansion club the Greater Western Sydney Giants . The offer , which the Herald Sun ’s Mark Robinson claimed to be worth $ 2.4 million over three seasons , would have taken effect in the new club 's first AFL season in 2012 . Martin later said he had never entertained the idea of moving to the start-up club . In round 10 he had gained attention for his on-field efforts again , this time being nominated for the 2010 AFL Rising Star award after a 21 disposal and 11 clearance match against Port Adelaide . Due to his previous tribunal conviction however , Martin was ruled ineligible for the award and thus did not officially place in the end of season award 's points tally . He drew the attention of Sydney coach Paul Roos by round 14 , prompting Roos to send veteran Brett Kirk onto Martin in a tagging role . Despite this extra attention , he still managed to record 18 disposals and a goal in the match at the MCG . After 17 rounds Martin ranked second at the club for clearances and inside 50s as well as third for disposals and contested possessions . At the same time he ranked first among that season 's Rising Star nominees in clearances , contested possessions and inside 50s . He was also fourth for average disposals and fifth for average tackles . In round 19 he was rested by the club before returning to play out the final five matches of the season . He missed just that one game in his debut season and finished the year ranked second at Richmond for clearances and inside 50s , as well as third for both contested possessions and disposals . In addition to winning the Fred Swift Medal for fourth place at the club 's best and fairest night , Martin also received six votes in the Brownlow Medal count that year , the most by any Richmond debutant since Craig Lambert in 1988 . At season 's end he reiterated his commitment to the club ( and rejection of the former GWS overtures ) by signing a two-year contract extension that would keep him at Richmond until the end of the 2013 season . The extension was reported by the Herald Sun to be in the vicinity of $ 400,000-a-year

Bob Dole , then head of the Republican Party , sharply criticized Time Warner after a meeting between Michael J. Fuchs ( head of the Warner Music Group ) , William Bennett , and C. Delores Tucker , at which Tucker and Bennett demanded that Fuchs read lyrics from NIN 's " Big Man with a Gun " . A year later , Bennett , Tucker , and Joseph Lieberman launched a similar campaign against MCA Records for their distribution of Marilyn Manson 's music . Many of his concerts were cancelled by authorities after this uproar . In addition , Dennis Cooper cited Ministry 's video for " Just One Fix " , which featured footage of William S. Burroughs , as an early example of heroin chic . Some initial reports claimed that Columbine High School shooters Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold were Marilyn Manson fans . In fact , they preferred KMFDM and Rammstein . Asa Coon , another school shooter , was a Manson fan . Manson , a former journalist , published a detailed response to the controversy following the Columbine shootings in an article published in '' Rolling Stone '' . It concluded : Sascha Konietzko reported that KMFDM was " sick and appalled " by the shootings , issuing a statement the following day saying : Rammstein stated that they " have no lyrical content or political beliefs that could have possibly influenced such behavior " . Rammstein have also been controversial for their use of Nazi imagery , including footage shot by Leni Riefenstahl for '' Olympia '' in their video for " Stripped " . Alec Empire , a German digital hardcore musician , declared that " Rammstein is successful for all the wrong reasons . I think they 're not a fascist band at all , but I think in Germany there 's a lot of misunderstanding and that 's why they sell records and I think that 's dangerous . " In response to the controversy , Rammstein stated that " We are not Nazis , Neo-Nazis , or any other kind of Nazi . We are against racism , bigotry or any other type of discrimination . " The band went on to create the song " Links 2-3-4 " , released in 2001 , which responded to the Nazi allegations by insinuating that they reside left on the political spectrum

The racy lyrics center around Rowland asking her man to use his hands all over her body , and are accompanied by a " synth-saturated beat " produced by Jonsin .

Wayne adds a rap verse complementing Rowland 's seductive suggestions , using the kitchen and a car as metaphors for sex . According to Scott Shetler from AOL Music , Rowland uses the lyrics to promise " to be her lover 's motivation . " Rowland called the record a mixture between dance and mash-up . When asked by MTV what Rowland thought of the song , she said , " It has that personality and characteristic to it that I do n't think anybody can deny .

		SCORE=0.0001831359877542127
		CONTEXT=The stories in '' After the Quake '' repeat motifs , themes , and elements common in much of Murakami 's earlier short stories and novels , but also present some notable stylistic changes . All six stories are told in the third person , as opposed to Murakami 's much more familiar first person narrative established in his previous work . Additionally , only one of the stories contains clear supernatural elements , which are present in the majority of Murakami 's stories . All of the stories are set in February 1995 , the month between the Kobe earthquake and the Tokyo gas attacks . Translator Jay Rubin says of the collection , " The central characters in '' After the Quake '' live far from the physical devastation , which they witness only on TV or in the papers , but for each of them the massive destruction unleashed by the earth itself becomes a turning point in their lives . They are forced to confront an emptiness they have borne inside them for years . " Komura , an early-thirties salesman living in Tokyo , comes home from work five days after the quake to find that his wife of five years has left him . She leaves a note saying that living with him is like living with a " chunk of air " and that other women would be lucky to be with him down the road . About a week later , he takes a week-long leave of absence . Before he leaves work that day , his friend Sasaki asks him if he would like to take an all-expenses-paid trip to Kushiro to deliver a small package to Sasaki 's sister Keiko ; he says yes

		CONTEXT=The stories in '' After the Quake '' repeat motifs , themes , and elements common in much of Murakami 's earlier short stories and novels , but also present some notable stylistic changes . All six stories are told in the third person , as opposed to Murakami 's much more familiar first person narrative established in his previous work . Additionally , only one of the stories contains clear supernatural elements , which are present in the majority of Murakami 's stories . All of the stories are set in February 1995 , the month between the Kobe earthquake and the Tokyo gas attacks . Translator Jay Rubin says of the collection , " The central characters in '' After the Quake '' live far from the physical devastation , which they witness only on TV or in the papers , but for each of them the massive destruction unleashed by the earth itself becomes a turning point in their lives . They are forced to confront an emptiness they have borne inside them for years . " Komura , an early-thirties salesman living in Tokyo , comes home from work five days after the quake to find that his wife of five years has left him . She leaves a note saying that living with him is like living with a " chunk of air " and that other women would be lucky to be with him down the road . About a week later , he takes a week-long leave of absence . Before he leaves work that day , his friend Sasaki asks him if he would like to take an all-expenses-paid trip to Kushiro to deliver a small package to Sasaki 's sister Keiko ; he says yes

		CONTEXT=Mattea 's decision to make an album about this topic was influenced by the fact that both of her grandfathers were miners , as well as by the Sago Mine disaster in 2006 , which , when it occurred , reminded Mattea of the Farmington Mine disaster that had occurred when she was nine years old . She has said that she was expecting a set of stories in the songs she covered on this album , but instead found a connection to her miner ancestors . Her deep interest in this topic was also noted by the album 's producer , Marty Stuart , as when they were recording the a cappella song " Black Lung " . Stuart said it would be like " trying to repaint the ' Mona Lisa ' " , in that it requires authentic commitment to the task . Mattea also stated that it was so difficult for her to learn the song that it took her six months to do so . Nevertheless , the first recording of Mattea 's version of the song ended up being kept after it made the recording engineer , whose father had died of black lung disease , cry . Stuart reacted by telling Mattea that this was a sign she was performing the song right

		CONTEXT=After Leonid Brezhnev assumed power in 1964 , much of Khrushchev 's reforms were reversed . The Brezhnev era began a new state of stagnation , and saw a decline in both the quality and quantity of products in the Soviet Union . Armenia was severely affected by these policies , as was to be demonstrated several years later in the catastrophic earthquake that hit Spitak . Material allocated to the building of new homes , such as cement and concrete , was diverted for other uses . Bribery and a lack of oversight saw the construction of shoddily built and weakly supported apartment buildings . When the earthquake hit on the morning of December 7 , 1988 , the houses and apartments least able to resist collapse were those built during the Brezhnev years . Ironically , the older the dwellings , the better they withstood the quake

QUERY_ANSWERS={'Mudan incident', 'were massacred'}
QUERY_CONTEXT=And Japan was eager to take every opportunity . In 1869 they took advantage of the defeat of the rebels of the Republic of Ezo to incorporate definitely the island of Hokkaido to Japan . For centuries , Japan viewed the Ryukyu Islands as one of its provinces . In 1871 the Mudan incident happened : cannibal Taiwanese aborigines murdered 54 Ryūkyūan sailors that had their ship shipwrecked . At that time the Ryukyu Islands were claimed by both Qing China and Japan , and the Japanese interpreted the incident as an attack on their citizens . They took steps to bring the islands in their jurisdiction : in 1872 the Japanese Ryukyu Domain was declared , and in 1874 a retaliatory incursion to Taiwan was sent , which was a success . The success of this expedition emboldened the Japanese : not even the Americans could defeat the Taiwanese cannibals in the Formosa Expedition of 1867 .

		CONTEXT=He established himself in Chicago , where in the great fire of 1871 he lost everything he possessed . In 1875 , he moved to New York City , finding work on the '' Century '' ( then '' Scribners '' ) magazine . Cole was associated with the magazine for 40 years as a pioneer craftsman of wood engraving . He immediately attracted attention by his unusual facility and his sympathetic interpretation of illustrations and pictures , and his publishers sent him abroad in 1883 to engrave a set of blocks after the old masters in the European galleries . These achieved for him a brilliant success . His reproductions of Italian , Dutch , Spanish , Flemish and English pictures were published in book form with appreciative notes by the engraver himself . '' Old Dutch and Flemish Masters '' was one of the books that Cole had contributed his wood engravings . Though the advent of new mechanical processes had rendered wood engraving almost a lost art and left practically no demand for the work of such craftsmen , Mr Cole was thus enabled to continue his work , and became one of the foremost contemporary masters of wood engraving . He received a medal of the first class at the Paris Exhibition of 1900 , and the only grand prize given for wood engraving at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition at St Louis , Missouri , in 1904 . In 1906 he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate Academician , and became a full Academician in 1908 . His son , Alphaeus Philemon Cole , was a noted portraitist who is also today recognized as having been the worlds oldest verified living man at the time of his death

		CONTEXT=Thousands of years prior to European settlement of the Pacific Northwest of the United States the native oyster species Ostrea lurida had been established as a valuable dietary resource for indigenous people living on the coastal waters . European settlers who began to colonize the Pacific Northwest developed an acquired taste for shellfish , especially oysters , a delicacy that were considered to be a symbol of wealth . In the early history of the Pacific Northwest , people satisfied their hunger for shellfish by harvesting naturally occurring oyster beds . It was initially believed that the populations of indigenous oysters were sufficient to supply both tribal and commercial harvest . A marketable industry was created on the export of oysters and soon exploitation of harvesting had depleted the natural oyster beds in California and Oregon . As a result Washington state became the main supplier to areas along the coast which had failed to establish any conservation practices . Noticing the economic value and decline of natural availability , farmers began efforts to cultivate oysters to try to satisfy demand . Over the years the oyster industry of the Pacific Northwest has gone from extremely lucrative to completely nonexistent , but still the industry has been able to adapt and survive .

		CONTEXT=On 1 January 1804 , Dessalines , the new leader under the dictatorial 1805 constitution , declared Haiti a free republic in the name of the Haitian people , which was followed by the massacre of the remaining whites . Dessalines ' secretary Boisrond-Tonnerre stated , " For our declaration of independence , we should have the skin of a white man for parchment , his skull for an inkwell , his blood for ink , and a bayonet for a pen ! " Haiti was the first independent nation in Latin America , the first post-colonial independent black-led nation in the world , and the only nation whose independence was gained as part of a successful slave rebellion . The country was damaged from years of war , its agriculture devastated , its formal commerce nonexistent . The country , therefore , had to be rebuilt . To realise this goal Dessalines adopted the economic organisation of serfdom . He proclaimed that every citizen would belong to one of two categories , laborer or soldier . Furthermore , he proclaimed the mastery of the state over the individual and consequently ordered that all laborers would be bound to a plantation . To avoid the appearance of slavery , however , Dessalines abolished the ultimate symbol of slavery , the whip . Likewise , the working day was shortened by a third . Dessalines ' chief motivator nonetheless was production and to this aim he granted much freedom to the plantations ' overseers . Barred from using the whip , many instead turned to lianes , which were thick vines abundant throughout the island , to persuade the laborers to keep working . Dessalines effectively sent the Haitian people back into slavery . Nevertheless , he succeeded in rebuilding much of the countryside and in raising production levels

" Stephen Holden of '' The New York Times '' called '' Outside the Law '' a " didactic , unashamedly manipulative film " , and also saw parallels to '' The Godfather '' and '' Army of Shadows '' : " Those are mighty shoes to fill , and as powerful and well-made as it is , '' Outside the Law '' is too schematic and single-minded to lodge itself in your mind as a fully realized cinematic epic . Its few female characters are sketchy at best . " Before the film premiered , already it was met by political controversy and nationalist-oriented criticism in France . Lionnel Luca , a member of the National Assembly for the UMP , appealed for a review by the Defence Historical Service as soon as he heard about the project . Guy Pervillé deplored the inevitable acceptance by moviegoers of the film as representing historical truth . The Defence Historical Service claimed that " the errors and anachronisms are so many and so gross that they can be identified by any historian ... The numerous improbabilities present in the scenario show that the writing of the latter was not preceded by a serious historical study . " The center of the controversy was the depiction of the 1945 Sétif massacre early in the film . The report elaborated , " The director wants to suggest that on May 8 , 1945 , Muslims in Sétif were blindly massacred by Europeans , whereas it 's the contrary that transpired . ... A ll historians agree that ... Europeans lashed out against Muslims in response to Muslims massacring Europeans . " This reaction is at odds with mainstream history , which concluded that , after restoring order in the town , French military and police then carried out a series of reprisals and summary executions of native civilians . Before even seeing the film , Luca also criticized the decision to give public funding to a film which he considered " anti-French " . Mustapha Orif , one of the film 's co-producers , responded to the accusations and defended the film 's portrayal of the massacre . " Rachid Bouchareb interviewed many people , witnesses and historians . From this point of view , I do not think at all that he has deviated from historical reality , " he said

		CONTEXT=As the Big East season progressed , the lack of a reliable shooting guard hurt Georgetown . Four different underclassmen started at the position , and , with poor shooting from the field by guards John Jacques ( 36.2 % in Big East play ) , Eric Micoud ( 34.3 % ) , and Irvin Church ( 17.9 % ) plaguing the Hoyas , they lost eight of their last eleven conference games to finish the Big East regular season with an 8-10 record , good for only an eighth-place finish . In the Big East Tournament , they defeated Miami in the first round but lost to ninth-ranked Seton Hall in the quarterfinal . Their 16-12 overall record at the end of the tournament , combined with their losing regular-season conference record and a weak non-conference schedule that included three non-Division I opponents , prevented them from receiving an invitation to the 1993 NCAA Tournament , breaking a 14-season streak of NCAA Tournament appearances for Georgetown dating back to the 1978-79 season

		CONTEXT=When Jackson left the role in 1999 , a recast was opposed by viewers and costars . When Jackson 's departure had previously been rumored in 1996 , Anthony Geary ( Luke ) told '' TV Guide '' that he " went to ( the '' GH '' powers ) and said , ' If we lose him , then let 's kill Lucky . ' Jonathan is too much a part of us to replace him . " Geary repeated these sentiments when Jackson confirmed leaving in 1999 . When a recast was rumored in early 2000 , Jackson stated : " When all the actors who are going to be working with the character do n't want it , it 's kind of too bad that they still do it . But I do n't really get surprised with a lot of things that they do . " The role was recast with Jacob Young , and by the time he appeared on-screen in February 2000 , the character had been off-screen for almost a year , speculated to be an attempt to ease the transition between actors due to Jackson 's popularity . Young was able to become accepted by fans ; in 2001 , Candace Havens wrote in '' The Free Lance – Star '' : " His hard work has paid off and many fans ca n't even remember there was ever someone else in the role . " Young was named Sexiest Soap Star by '' People '' magazine in 2001 . In 2002 , Young won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actor . Greg Vaughan , who took over the role from 2003 to 2009 , was the only portrayer of Lucky not to be nominated for an Emmy award . However , Vaughan did have a fan following . He was chosen by ABC Daytime and SOAPnet to participate in their 2008 Hot Guys Calendar , featuring popular male costars from ABC soap operas . At the start of 2008 , '' Zap2it '' named Vaughan No. 6 on their Top 10 Most Improved list , stating : " The gorgeous Mr. Vaughan plays angry and sexy very well . Thank goodness we 're getting to see it . " During Vaughan 's tenure , Lucky entered into a relationship with Sam McCall ( Kelly Monaco ) that was popular with fans . '' Zap2it '' named them No. 6 on their list of Top Couples of 2007 , and tied them for No. 3 in 2008 along with entangled couple Elizabeth ( Herbst ) and Jason Morgan ( Steve Burton ) , stating : " Lucky and Sam were conceived out of a revenge plot , yet quickly surprised fans and execs alike with their instant chemistry . Is the Quad in for another partner-switching shake-up in 2009 ? " When Vaughan left in 2009 , he reflected on his reception : " I am grateful as to how the fans embraced me , whether they liked me or not . It was my job to win them over and I did that in due time . " Some felt Vaughan was not a good fit for the character . In April 2008 , Allison Waldman of '' The Huffington Post '' named Jackson as one of the top ten actors to make an impact on '' General Hospital '' , stating : " He 's still the real Lucky to many people , even though two other actors have subsequently played the part . " When Jackson was hired to reprise the role in 2009 , his return was highly anticipated , but accompanied by controversy as Vaughan was let go in order to bring Jackson back . Fans had a bittersweet reaction to the switch . The network promoted Jackson 's return with the phrase , " Elizabeth 's first love is back ! " , which angered some of Vaughan 's fans . However , ratings rose the week Jackson returned , and his performance was well received . Jackson was nominated for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series in 2010 , only having been with the show for three months of 2009 . Jackson 's return changed the dynamic of the Elizabeth and Nikolas affair storyline , which had a negative reception from fans who thought it did not align with the history between Herbst and Jackson . The scenes in early 2010 where Lucky confronts Elizabeth and Nikolas about their affair received praise . That April , '' We Love Soaps '' named Jackson No. 26 of the top 50 Greatest Soap Actors , Damon L. Jacobs commenting : " From that first scene as Lucky in the Canadian diner , to his recent scenes of betrayal railing against Elizabeth and Nikolas , Jonathan adds a profound depth and spiritual gravity to the scripted words that is far beyond his years . His piercing bloodshot eyes shoot daggers far more deadly than Sonny 's guns , and his smile encapsulates all that was celebrated about Luke and Laura 's connection . " Michael Logan of '' TV Guide '' named Jackson the best actor of 2010 , referencing the affair confrontation when stating : Jackson submitted those scenes for the 38th Daytime Emmy Awards , where he won his fourth Daytime Emmy Award and first win as Outstanding Supporting Actor . The scenes were compared to classics such as Judith Light 's performance of Karen Wolek 's courtroom confession scene on '' One Life to Live '' and Kim Zimmer ’s performance of Reva Shayne 's fountain scene on '' Guiding Light '' . Jackson 's on-screen chemistry with Erin Chambers ( Siobhan ) also had a positive reception at the end of 2010 . However the following year they were rated the No. 6 Worst Soap Opera Couple of 2011 by '' Zap2it '' , who stated : " We spent 2011 desperately clinging to those few early memories , as Siobhan transformed from an appealing character into a shrill , insecure harpy ( ... ) Try as Jackson and Chambers might , the actors were unable to salvage an ounce of their prior appeal as a couple . " On the other hand , the entertainment website named Jackson No. 3 of the Top 10 Male Entertainers that year . Jackson had a range of emotional work in 2011 that received acclaim , including the scenes following the death of Lucky 's son Jake , a storyline met by criticism by some fans . In 2012 , Jackson won his fifth Daytime Emmy Award for his scenes where Lucky tells Luke that Luke was the driver that hit Jake and confronts him about his drinking . When Jackson was nominated , '' On-Air On-Soaps '' stated :

		CONTEXT=Former television columnist for '' The Star-Ledger '' Alan Sepinwall expressed his boredom on the focus given on Grey 's relationships storylines while reviewing the second season 's finale : " On those occasions when Meredith 's not involved in a plot about her love life , I do kind of like her , but those moments are so infrequent compared to her constant angsting over McDreamy -- not to mention all those seemingly unrelated storylines that always turn into a metaphor for that relationship -- that I really , really ca n't stand her . " During the show 's third season , the development of the character received negative reviews , with Cristopher Monfette of '' IGN '' stating that her storyline has become " some bizarrely under-developed sub-plot about depression and giving Derek a season 's worth of reconsidering to do . " Also during the third season , Robert Rorke of the '' New York Post '' noted the decline in Meredith 's role in the show , expressing disappointment : " She used to be the queen of the romantic dilemmas , but lately , she 's been a little dopey , what with the endless McDreamy soliloquies . " Similarly , Macleans.ca found their storyline in the fourth season overused , " This whole ' Oh I need more time , ' but ' Oh , I 'm jealous if you look at someone else ' angst was tired in the second season , frustrating in the third and now a total channel changer . The will-they-or-won ' t-they plot does n't work because they 've already been in and out of that relationship too many times . Meredith is a nag and McDreamy is henpecked . " On a more positive note , her relationship with Shepherd was included in AOL TV 's list of the " Best TV Couples of All Time " and in the same list by '' TV Guide '' . During the sixth season the development of the character was praised , Glenn Diaz of '' BuddyTV '' commented that " You got ta love Mer when she 's gloomy . " , in addition to praising Pompeo 's performance . In her review of the episode Tainted Obligation she wrote " I felt for Meredith , but after Lexie 's heartfelt begging and pleading , I was happy that Mere finally grows up and casts her selfishness aside . Three seasons ago Meredith would never have dreamed of putting Lexie first , and I was proud of her for giving up part of her liver — her offer to get to know her dad was an even bigger milestone . " Reviewing the first part of the eighth season , TV Fanatic lauded the character and wrote : " this season belongs to Meredith Grey . She is the '' heart and soul of the show '' and has been outstanding . This is a character that used to be so dark and twisty and has now grown into a more mature woman . Ellen Pompeo has been at the top of her game this season . " '' Wit & Fancy '' praised the transformation of the character and stated , " Of course Meredith will still make rash decisions like when she took off with Zola or tampered with the trial , but she does things out of love and the kindness of her heart now and not because she is dark and twisty . Considering where Meredith was at the beginning and where she is now , I think she went through a remarkable journey and did more than just growing up , she finally became ' all whole and healed ' . " Maura O'Malley of '' Bustle '' also lauded the development of the character ahead of season 12 saying , " When the series began , Meredith was just a girl sitting in a bar celebrating the exciting next phase of her life . She had graduated medical school , she was starting her residency at a prestigious hospital , and she was simply looking for a no-strings attached , one night stand . What she got instead was a complicated romantic relationship that rivals Romeo and Juliet — but the key is , she was n't searching for love . Working and learning were — and continue to be — her priorities , while McDreamy was simply an added perk . Hopefully , the new season of Grey 's Anatomy will reflect this change in tone , because Meredith is a strong , independent woman — and she will be just fine . " Later in the series , Ellen Pompeo received critical acclaim with numerous critics lauding her portrayal of the character . Reviewing the episode She 's Leaving Home '' CarterMatt '' called her the " anchor " for Grey 's saying , " Throughout , this was an episode completely anchored by Ellen Pompeo , who has done some of her best work ever on the show the past couple of weeks . Tonight , she cried , she fought , and she learned that she was carrying his child . " and added that Pompeo is often " ovelooked " saying , " Her subtlety is probably why she is often overlooked . " Rick Porter of '' Zap2it '' reviewing " How to Save a Life " wrote , " Without Meredith , and without one of Pompeo 's strongest performances in her long time on the show , " How to Save a Life " would have run the risk of coming across as a baldly manipulative death episode , the likes of which the show has done several times before . He added . " How to Save a Life " may not be the ideal Emmy-submission episode for Pompeo , considering Meredith is off screen for more than half of it . But it 's among the best work she 's ever done on the show . " '' USA Today '' also lauded Pompeo saying , " In some ways , the episode ( How to Save a Life ) was even more of a showcase for Pompeo . She had some of the more memorable and well-played scenes , from her angry response to the doctor who tries to tell her what her choices are , to her resignation when she realizes she has to comfort and motivate the young doctor whose mistakes cost Derek his life . " The relation between Meredith and Cristina has been acclaimed and been a highlight of the show . Mark Perigard of the Boston Herald considered the friendship to be " the secret core of Grey 's " . Aisha Harris of '' Slate '' called their relation '' The Best Female Friendship on TV '' adding that " With those two characters , showrunner Shonda Rhimes and her team of writers created one of the most nuanced and realistic portrayals of female friendship on television . " Samantha Highfill of '' Entertainment Weekly '' called Cristina and Meredith the best female friends on TV because " they do n't try to be " . There 's nothing fake about them , which is a rarity in how female friends are portrayed on television . She further went on to call them ' soulmates ' , " And even though they 'd never dare get sappy enough to say it , they 're soul mates . Margaret Lyons of Vulture ( magazine ) called the friendship " dream BFF relationship . " and the primary focus of the show , " One of the series ' calling cards has been its depiction of female friendship and particularly the primacy that friendship enjoyed over romantic relationships . " '' E! '' at the time of Sandra Oh 's exit wrote , " In Grey 's Anatomy 's 10-year history , the doctor duo has been through a lot together : weddings , deaths , plane crashes , bomb threats , shooting , you name it , they 've lived ( and danced ) through it . " and added , " And with the three words , ' Y '' ou 're my person . '' ' Cristina Yang and Meredith Grey solidified their status as the small screen 's best best friends ever . " Marama Whyte of '' Hypable '' wrote , " Critically , the key relationship in Meredith 's life was not her romance with Derek Shepherd , but her passionate , indestructible , absolutely enviable friendship with Cristina . Talk about relationship goals ; who wants McDreamy when Cristina Yang could be your person . These two were the real powerhouse , and Shonda Rhimes did n't shy away from making the audience remember this . Derek was the love of her life , but Cristina was her soul mate . More than anyone else , Cristina challenged Meredith , was honest with her and inspired her . For these reasons , it was Cristina who was constantly the source of Meredith 's character development , not Derek . " Pompeo 's character has also been used to define the image a strong woman , '' Bustle '' previewing the 12th season wrote , " Meredith Grey has always been capable of being on her own . Grey 's Anatomy is about Meredith 's journey . Men and romantic interests are a part of her life , but they are not the priority . She does n't need McDreamy . Grey 's Anatomy does n't need McDreamy . So even if the writers do decide to create a new love interest for Ms. Grey ( Martin Henderson , perhaps ? ) , it would n't matter . I have faith that the show 's writers will do this storyline justice , because TV needs more strong single women — and Meredith seems like the perfect candidate . " The site added , " This past season was almost a trial run for a McDreamy-less Grey 's Anatomy . When Derek left for Washington D.C. to pursue his research , Meredith stayed behind and focused on her own career . She did n't chase him . Her priority were her children and the Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital . Meredith showed that she would never put aside her own dreams and aspirations for a man , and I believe that this wo n't change after Derek 's death . " Pompeo has won and has been nominated for multiple awards for her portrayal of Grey . She and the '' Grey 's Anatomy '' cast won Best Ensemble in a Television Series at the 2006 Satellite Awards . During the following year 's ceremony , she was named Best Actress in a Television Drama Series . She was among the '' Grey 's Anatomy '' cast members awarded the Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series accolade at the 13th Screen Actors Guild Awards , and received nominations in the same category in 2006 and 2008 . Pompeo received a Best Performance by an Actress in a Drama Series nomination at the 64th Golden Globe Awards – the program won Best Drama Series at the same ceremony . Also in 2007 , Pompeo and the female cast and crew of '' Grey 's Anatomy '' received the Women in Film Lucy Award , which honors those " whose work in television has positively influenced attitudes toward women . " Pompeo 's performance has garnered her multiple People 's Choice Awards . At the 37th People 's Choice Awards , she was nominated against Dempsey and Oh in the Favorite TV Doctor category , and the following year , she was a contender in the Favorite TV Drama Actress category . Since 2012 , Pompeo has received a nomination at the People 's Choice Awards every year in two categories at 40th People 's Choice Awards alongside Patrick Dempsey and Sandra Oh respectively . She won the Best Drama Actress Award at both the 39th People 's Choice Awards and the 41st People 's Choice Awards . In 2007 , show-business awards reporter Tom O'Neil commented that Pompeo was overdue an Emmy Award nomination for her role in '' Grey 's Anatomy '' . Readers of O'Neil 's awards website , '' The Envelope '' , included Pompeo in their 2009 nominations for Best Drama Actress in the site 's Gold Derby TV Awards .

QUERY_CONTEXT=Writing for '' The New York Times '' , John J. O'Connor described the production as " a richly textured tapestry crammed with the social details that were the speciality of Mr. Delderfield " , with " a steady flow of insightful and touching moments " . He praised the performances of the cast and that of Duttine in particular . '' People '' magazine called the series a " colorful chronicle of post-World War I England that never crosses over to the gooey side of sentiment . " In a review for the DVD release in 2011 , '' PopMatters '' was less enthusiastic , calling Delderfield 's material " inconsequential " and writing : " The action veers sluggishly from the mildly diverting to the excruciatingly dull . " The review summarised the series as " basically a dated , dull , tiresome , tedious old drama by an author whose reputation is far from robust . " The adaptation was nominated in the Best Drama Series category at the 1981 British Academy Television Awards and in the Outstanding Limited Series category at the 1983 Primetime Emmy Awards

		CONTEXT=Three practice sessions were held before the Sunday race — two on Friday , and a third on Saturday . The Friday morning and afternoon sessions each lasted 90 minutes . The third session was held on Saturday morning and lasted an hour . The very first practice session on the newly opened Valencia Street Circuit was held on a dusty and slippery track , but despite the drivers ' relative unfamiliarity with the circuit there were no major incidents ( though David Coulthard did hit the barriers late in the session ) . Sébastien Bourdais went fastest early on , but it was his Toro Rosso teammate Sebastian Vettel who posted the quickest time of the session . Massa and Hamilton finished second and third , with Bourdais just behind them . Following the session , the drivers and personnel observed a minute 's silence for those killed in the plane crash in Madrid two days previously . Kimi Räikkönen topped the timesheets in second practice , having traded fastest times with teammate Massa for the majority of the session . Fernando Alonso had the set the quickest time late , but was surpassed by Räikkönen in his final flying lap . A notable incident in the session involved Nico Rosberg spinning under brakes in the final corners , and narrowly missing Mark Webber on the inside , before rejoining the track with no damage done . Surprsingly , usual back-runner Jenson Button , driving for Honda , finished third . After the session , Fernando Alonso , driving for Renault , was reprimanded and fined € 10,000 , after crossing the pitlane entry line early on in the second session . Rain overnight meant that the Valencia track began with almost no rubber on the surface , but Robert Kubica was still able to carry enough speed to become the first man of the weekend to break into the 1:38 s , with Rosberg and Bourdais close behind . There were minimal mishaps , with only Hamilton and Timo Glock spinning . Jarno Trulli spent the majority of the session in the pits with gearbox problems , completing only two laps

		CONTEXT=A seismic hazard is the probability that an earthquake will occur in a given geographic area , within a given window of time , and with ground motion intensity exceeding a given threshold . With a hazard thus estimated , risk can be assessed and included in such areas as building codes for standard buildings , designing larger buildings and infrastructure projects , land use planning and determining insurance rates . The seismic hazard studies also may generate two standard measures of anticipated ground motion , both confusingly abbreviated MCE ; the simpler probabilistic Maximum Considered Earthquake ( or Event ) , used in standard building codes , and the more detailed and deterministic Maximum Credible Earthquake incorporated in the design of larger buildings and civil infrastructure like dams or bridges . It is important to clarify which MCE is being discussed .

		CONTEXT=On 18 April 1906 a major earthquake hit San Francisco , and the resulting fires destroyed over 80 % of the city , killed thousands of people , and left half of the population homeless . Misled by local propaganda as to earthquake likelihood , few residents of San Francisco had bought earthquake insurance , but they had bought fire insurance . In the wake of the devastating fires following the earthquake , many insurance companies fought paying their policyholders , often by quibbling over causality ( since the insurance was not for earthquakes ) , or paying only 75 % of the amounts due . This led to many lawsuits from policyholders . At least 14 insurers went bankrupt , and some insurers – mostly German and Austrian – simply disappeared and denied all coverage

Haileybury suffered the worst damage , and approximately ninety percent of the town was destroyed , leaving only Millionaire 's Row and a few other neighborhoods intact . The mass destruction is partially attributable to strong wind on the day of the fire . Approximately 3500 people were left homeless by the fire . The Toronto Transit Commission ( TTC ) , with many retired street cars in its yards , sent many old car bodies to serve as houses during the reconstruction . Some of these cars remained for years , and one has recently been restored and is in the museum at Haileybury . As well , the area was affected by the 1935 Timiskaming earthquake , which had its epicentre at Lac Kipawa in Quebec , approximately halfway between the Haileybury/New Liskeard area and North Bay

		CONTEXT=Riverside Park is a park in Kamloops , British Columbia , Canada that encompasses a beach next to a river . The park is bordered by the Thompson River and Landsdowne Street . There is a monument in the park that indicates the height to which four different floods reached throughout the history of the park . Riverside Park also includes a water park . There is an 11 PM curfew at the park , but it is not normally enforced . In 1885 , the site that would eventually become the park was used as a campsite by Chinese Canadians from Savona 's Ferry working on the Canadian Pacific Railway . When members of the On - to - Ottawa Trek stopped in Kamloops on their way from Vancouver to Ottawa , Ontario in 1935 , Mayor W.J. Moffat offered the men an empty hospital to sleep in , but the men declined , many choosing rather to sleep in Riverside Park where they had only one blanket to share between three or four men . In 2011 , a parking garage was proposed to be built in the park , but a group called the Friends of Riverside Park gathered signatures from more than 10 % of the Kamloops electorate opposing the proposal , thereby forcing a referendum on the subject . Before the referendum could take place , however , the city council unanimously voted to put an end to the plans to build the parking garage .

		CONTEXT=On 4 October 2009 , Fred Halliday , Emeritus Professor of International Relations at the LSE and the School 's leading expert on the Middle East , wrote a memorandum to the LSE Council regarding the proposed cooperation with the Gaddafi Foundation . " I have repeatedly expressed reservations about formal educational and funding links with that country . " While those in favour of accepting the donation argued that " Libya is changing internally , " most informed observers agree that while some of the worst excesses for the moment have ceased , the rights of its people are badly protected . Libya " remains a country run by a secretive , erratic and corrupt elite . " Since 9/11 the Libyan government has reached compromises with the West on a number of issues , notably the Lockerbie bombing and nuclear weapons . Yet tactical changes in foreign policy are not sufficient for the purposes of evaluating political and academic links . There are also ways in which Libyan foreign policy has '' not '' changed : the country continues to call for the destruction of Israel ; Muammar Gaddafi recently called for the abolition of Switzerland , and he receives the leader of the Somali pirates operating off the Horn of Africa as honoured guests of state . Moreover , Libya 's handling of the Lockerbie bombing " has not been characterised by either consistency or clarity , " I have in the past , Halliday noted , defended accepting grants from authoritarian regimes such as the Gulf states , " but there should be clear limits on this , depending on the degree of political and human rights abuses perpetrated with them and on their ongoing foreign policy conduct . " Whitehall and the City are now happy to do business with Libya , but it does not follow that the LSE should do the same . Responsible leaders throughout the Middle East continue to express reservations regarding Libya , including " its more prominent ' liberal ' representatives . " We must remember , Halliday concluded , that the " liberal " wing within a regime such as Libya does not have the function of producing change but its role is instead " to reach compromises with internal hard-liners that serve to lessen external pressure . " A good case in point are the proposals LSE now is considering . It is , as LSE alumni in positions of responsibility in the region caution , " far too early for the School to take this step . " In 2009 , Human Rights Watch was allowed entry to Libya , via Saif al-Islam Gaddafi 's non-profit organization in order to gather facts about the human rights situation there . While HRW reported that there were concerns about the " repressive atmosphere , " they felt there were signs of " improvement " and Sarah Leah Whitson , director of HRW 's Middle East division said that one should not " underestimate the importance of the efforts made so far " by Gaddafi in the realm of human rights in Libya . She also wrote of her official visit that " the real impetus for the transformation rests squarely with a quasi-governmental organization , the Qaddafi Foundation for International Charities and Development " chaired by Gaddafi . She praised Gaddafi for establishing the country 's two semi-private newspapers , and said " it is impossible to underestimate the importance of the efforts made so far . Let 's hope this spring will last . " In January 2011 , HRW criticised other organisations as well as governments that had previously dealt with Gaddafi . HRW Business and Human Rights Director Arvind Ganesan condemned the London School of Economics ( LSE ) for allowing " abusive and corrupt officials or their families to launder their images in exchange for money " . This was later followed by Ganesen saying that " the London School of Economics did not act until Saif al-Islam 's father literally began to kill his own people " . According to NGO Monitor , this was despite the fact that David Held , Co-Director of LSE Global Governance , was partially influenced by Whitson 's remarks regarding her Libyan visit , referring to Saif al-Islam Gaddafi as a reformer

		CONTEXT=Regarding the neo-Nazi Admiral Duncan pub bombing in 1999 by David Copeland , Murray wrote in the '' Morning Star '' : " Everything about this episode strikes me as odd . It happened during a war i.e. the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia that is not going particularly well " , and alleged that some neo-Nazi groups " may very well have been established with MI5 or Special Branch connivance . And certainly the state — or groups within the security apparatus — is more than capable of manipulating deranged human-haters without the latter even noticing that they are being manipulated . " Murray told '' The Times '' in 2019 : " As I wrote at the time my speculations were no more than ' conjecture and supposition ' . There is no basis for any suggestion that the bombing of the Admiral Duncan was the responsibility of anyone other than David Copeland . " Murray is considered an apologist for Joseph Stalin by his critics , such as Nick Cohen . Described as an " admirer " in '' The Independent on Sunday '' in 2003 , in 1999 he wrote in his '' Morning Star '' column : In 1999 , Murray said of KGB spy Melita Norwood : " She herself says that she has no regrets and I do not see why she should . She took advantage of the position that she was in to give her side a bit of help in the international class struggle . The strength of the Soviet Union was a huge factor in favour of world peace , something which has become more obvious in its absence today . Those who contributed , however slightly , to that strength did all of us a service . " When asked about these comments by '' The Times '' in 2019 , he said " The Cold War is over . I would under no circumstances condone anyone acting as Melita Norwood did today . " In 2008 , Murray identified " one of the successes " of the " nationalities policy of the Soviet Union " as being the promotion of " the cultural , linguistic and educational development of each ethnic group , no matter how small or how historically marginalised . " This comment was criticised by author Edward Lucas in '' The Guardian '' who accused Murray of ignoring " the Chechens , Crimean Tatars and other victims of Stalin 's murderous deportation policies . " In a short history of the CPGB , published in 1995 , Murray wrote : " That things happened in the USSR which were inexcusable and which ultimately prejudiced Socialism ’s whole prospect is today undeniable . Whether Communists in the capitalist world could or should have done more than they did is much more contentious " . Oliver Kamm , in '' The Times '' commented in 2016 : " In short , Mr Murray believes that British communists in the 1930s were justified in backing the Great Terror , the Moscow Trials and the Ukraine famine . Mr Murray predictably supports the most nightmarish totalitarian state in the modern world " . Murray was a critic of David Miliband in his role as Foreign Secretary , arguing that his stance on the 2008 Georgian crisis revealed him as a ' neoconservative ' whose approach had ' made it abundantly clear where he stands on the great divide in world politics today . He is for the US empire '
