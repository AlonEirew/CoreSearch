		CONTEXT=Limbo Race was an American post-punk band formed in Boston , Massachusetts in 1979 by Randy Black on guitar , John Neidhart on bass , and Peter Keaveney on drums . In 1981 , Keaveney was replaced by drummer Mark Poulin and the band added saxophonist Mark Chenevert . Limbo Race featured an angular , sometimes harsh sound that some critics compared to the Gang of Four and The Cure . Black 's lyrics described an unsettled world where communication was difficult , and drew upon dark anthropological references , images from childhood , and intimate details of his relationships with friends and lovers . Limbo Race developed a passionate cult following and , after winning the WBCN Rock & Roll Rumble in 1982 , the band added keyboardist Catherine Coleman and toured extensively throughout the Northeastern United States until 1984 when the band finally broke up .

		CONTEXT=Eulalie Piccard ( Saint Petersburg , 26 October 1879 - Neuchâtel , June 1957 ) , sometimes called Eulalie Piccard Guée , was a Russian - Swiss novelist , translator and teacher , writing in French . She was one of the first literary writers to explore the transformation of Russia into the Soviet Union and the police state that was constructed there under Joseph Stalin . While her work does not approach the literary force of Alexander Solzhenitsyn or Varlam Shalamov and did n't reach major public attention , it represented an early sustained effort to expose legal and penal developments in the Soviet Union that , in the 1930s and 1940s , were little discussed outside Russian emigrant circles . When show trials and labour camps were referred to in newspapers and books at the time , the tone was generally sensational and made little attempt to connect them to Soviet political culture or to everyday life .

It was regarded as a natural successor to the progressive politics more closely associated with the Action Group and Unity Party of Nigeria ( UPN ) led by Chief Obafemi Awolowo in the First and Second Republics respectively . However , criticism of the party 's more pragmatic and less ideological political outlook associated with AG and UPN , has made many argue it was less of a worthy political heir .

		CONTEXT=In 1990 Rafelson directed '' Mountains of the Moon '' , a film about the 1857 – 58 journey of Richard Francis Burton and John Hanning Speke in their expedition to central Africa — the project that culminated in Speke 's discovery of the source of the Nile River . It starred Patrick Bergin as Burton and Iain Glen as Speke , and was hailed by critic Roger Ebert as " completely absorbing . " Ebert continued , " It tells its story soberly and intelligently , and with quiet style ... It 's the kind of movie that sends you away from the screen filled with curiosity to know more about this man Burton . " In '' Newsweek '' , critic Jack Kroll wrote , " The exploits of Sir Richard Francis Burton make Lawrence of Arabia look like a tourist . . . . From scene to scene this film grips you as few movies do , moving between Africa and England to spotlight an extraordinary range of characters in both ' primitive ' and ' civilized ' cultures : from the African tribal chiefs , mild or murderous , to the nabobs of the Royal Geographical Society , honest or treacherous . " Rafelson later observed , " I was very lucky to make that movie . And I can tell you , if there was ever a movie that I enjoyed making , it was that one . " In 1992 Rafelson teamed up with Nicholson and '' Five Easy Pieces '' screenwriter Carole Eastman for the film '' Man Trouble '' . In 1996 he made his last film with Nicholson to date , '' Blood and Wine '' . His most recent films are 1998 's '' Poodle Springs '' and 2002 's '' No Good Deed '' , based on works by Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett , respectively . '' No Good Deed '' was entered into the 24th Moscow International Film Festival

A more restrained album than their previous two efforts , the album was produced by Steve Cropper ( of Booker T. and the M.G. 's ) instead of hard rock producers as on Have a Good Time but Get out Alive ! . Among the more popular songs on the album were the title track , along with " Saints and Sinners " ( a song about a Vietnam veteran ) , and " Be My Friend " which includes a guitar riff in tribute to Van Morrison 's " Here Comes the Night " ; all of which still feature in Joe Grushecky 's modern live performances . Like the band 's previous two albums , Blood on the Bricks would be praised by critics but largely ignored by the public . Before their next album the band would change their name to simply " The Houserockers " in an attempt to achieve success outside of their native region .

		CONTEXT=Reviews of '' Under Rug Swept '' on its release were generally positive . '' Billboard '' described the album as " supreme " and " very human ... it satisfies with moments of darkness , enlightenment , anger , bittersweet tension , and happiness ... Although 2002 is still young , consider '' Under Rug Swept '' one of the year 's best . " '' Q '' magazine said the album was " a smart shot across the bows ... some of the most inviting music of her career ... Morissette has fashioned a lyrical Trojan Horse to be wheeled into unsuspecting homes for months to come . " Robert Christgau wrote , " The pop-rock here lacks the faux-punk edge on '' Jagged Little Pill '' ... But Morissette instantly demonstrates her gift for the catchy ... topping memorable verse with indelible chorus , she 's a self-actualized nut who goes for what she wants , exactly as pretentious as the college girls she represents for . " According to '' LA Weekly '' , the album " is Alanis Morissette in top form , exercising her God-given right to vent and sound beautiful doing so . " Other critical appraisals were less favorable . '' Rolling Stone '' , in a three-star review , wrote " The music is brawny and meticulous ... but '' Under Rug Swept '' just about drowns in psychobabble . While the tone of the songs , and the grain of Morissette 's voice , promise intimacy , there 's hardly a private detail anywhere . " '' Entertainment Weekly '' said " the album 's garbled title is also preparation for some of the clumsiest lyrics to be heard on a pop record in years ... The songs are riddled with such overwritten Psych 101 ruminations . " '' The Village Voice '' criticised the lyrics , saying " Much like even non-football fans used to be mesmerized by Howard Cosell 's genius for never using two words when 23 would do , you do n't have to be a love-damaged 17-year-old girl to find '' Under Rug Swept '' 's dense verbiage a trip . Words tumble forth and arrange themselves kaleidoscopically into all sorts of unusual categories ... I 'm just not sure that pop music should come out of a thesaurus . " '' NME '' called it " a tedious album " with " overwrought folk-rock like ' Surrendering ' and ' Hands Clean ' destined for a thousand organic juice bars . Lyrically , it 's often hilarious ... This record moves way beyond armchair psychology — in fact , there are armchairs that have a cannier grasp of the mind . " '' Under Rug Swept '' received a Juno Award nomination in the category of " Pop Album of the Year " . Morissette herself won the " Jack Richardson Producer of the Year " award for the songs " Hands Clean " and " So Unsexy " , and she was nominated in the " Artist of the Year " category . ( For more information , see Juno Awards of 2003 . ) '' Under Rug Swept '' entered the Canadian albums chart at number one with first week sales of 35,000 copies , and the CRIA certified it platinum the following month for shipments of 100,000 . In the U.S. the album sold 215,000 copies in its first week , debuting at number one on the '' Billboard '' 200 chart during a busy sales week following the 2002 Grammy Awards ceremony ; it stayed in the top spot for a week . Within a month of release it had sold 500,000 copies , and the RIAA certified it platinum for shipments of over one million .

		CONTEXT=The Committee for the Defence of National Interests ( original name in French : Comité pour la défense des intérêts nationaux ; abbreviated CDNI or CDIN ) was an anti-communist right - wing political party founded in the Kingdom of Laos on 17 June 1958 . Dismayed by the election of Lao communists to the National Assembly in the May 1958 elections , younger politicians and military officers founded CDNI as an alternative to older Lao politicians and senior officers then in power . The CDNI pronounced itself as a force for anti-corruption efforts in the Royal Lao Government . It was backed by the United States embassy ; American support was manifested in political advice and civic actions such as Operation Booster Shot . In the 24 April 1960 elections , which were obviously rigged , the CDNI won 32 of 59 seats . The Pathet Lao leadership had been detained during the election ; on 23 May 1960 , they escaped to join their insurrection in the mountains .

		CONTEXT=The dangers to journalists in Russia have been well known since the early 1990s but concern over the number of unsolved killings soared after Anna Politkovskaya 's murder in Moscow on 7 October 2006 . While international monitors mentioned a dozen deaths , some sources within Russia talked of over two hundred fatalities . The evidence has since been examined and documented in two reports , published in Russian and English , by international organizations . These revealed a basic confusion in terminology that explained the seemingly enormous numerical discrepancy : statistics of premature death among journalists ( from work accidents , crossfire incidents , and purely criminal or domestic cases of manslaughter ) were repeatedly equated with the much smaller number of targeted ( contract ) killings or work - related murders . The Remembrance Day of Journalists Killed in the Line of Duty in Russia is observed on 15 December every year .

But Morissette instantly demonstrates her gift for the catchy ... topping memorable verse with indelible chorus , she 's a self-actualized nut who goes for what she wants , exactly as pretentious as the college girls she represents for . " According to '' LA Weekly '' , the album " is Alanis Morissette in top form , exercising her God-given right to vent and sound beautiful doing so . " Other critical appraisals were less favorable . '' Rolling Stone '' , in a three-star review , wrote " The music is brawny and meticulous ... but '' Under Rug Swept '' just about drowns in psychobabble . While the tone of the songs , and the grain of Morissette 's voice , promise intimacy , there 's hardly a private detail anywhere . " '' Entertainment Weekly '' said " the album 's garbled title is also preparation for some of the clumsiest lyrics to be heard on a pop record in years ... The songs are riddled with such overwritten Psych 101 ruminations . " '' The Village Voice '' criticised the lyrics , saying " Much like even non-football fans used to be mesmerized by Howard Cosell 's genius for never using two words when 23 would do , you do n't have to be a love-damaged 17-year-old girl to find '' Under Rug Swept '' 's dense verbiage a trip . Words tumble forth and arrange themselves kaleidoscopically into all sorts of unusual categories ... I 'm just not sure that pop music should come out of a thesaurus . " '' NME '' called it " a tedious album " with " overwrought folk-rock like ' Surrendering ' and ' Hands Clean ' destined for a thousand organic juice bars . Lyrically , it 's often hilarious ... This record moves way beyond armchair psychology — in fact , there are armchairs that have a cannier grasp of the mind . " '' Under Rug Swept '' received a Juno Award nomination in the category of " Pop Album of the Year " . Morissette herself won the " Jack Richardson Producer of the Year " award for the songs " Hands Clean " and " So Unsexy " , and she was nominated in the " Artist of the Year " category . ( For more information , see Juno Awards of 2003 . ) '' Under Rug Swept '' entered the Canadian albums chart at number one with first week sales of 35,000 copies , and the CRIA certified it platinum the following month for shipments of 100,000 . In the U.S. the album sold 215,000 copies in its first week , debuting at number one on the '' Billboard '' 200 chart during a busy sales week following the 2002 Grammy Awards ceremony ; it stayed in the top spot for a week . Within a month of release it had sold 500,000 copies , and the RIAA certified it platinum for shipments of over one million . '' Under Rug Swept '' debuted at number one in 12 countries , including Germany , Japan and Australia . It debuted at number two in France and the United Kingdom , where the BPI certified it gold for shipping 100,000 copies

Welles could not find the film a distributor in the United States for over three years , and even after its U.S. release it was largely ignored . The film was re-released to theaters in a 1992 restoration that screened out of competition at the 1992 Cannes Film Festival and was shown to acclaim in the United States . The film has a 93 % approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes , based on 32 reviews with an average rating of 7.9 / 10 . The website 's critical consensus states , " This ragged take on Othello may take liberties with the source material , but Orson Welles 's genius never fails to impress . " In 1992 , Beatrice Welles-Smith , daughter of Orson Welles , supervised the restoration of the film , which saw over $ 1 million spent on improving the picture quality , re-synching the audio , adding extra sound effects , and completely re-recording the music in stereo . Although the restoration was greeted with positive reviews upon its release , it subsequently came under attack for numerous technical flaws and alterations . Further alterations were made between the restoration 's theatrical release and its home media release , after complaints that the opening scene lacked the Gregorian chanting it had previously had , and another scene was missing entirely . This is the only version which has been available on VHS and DVD since the mid-1990s , since legal action by Beatrice Welles has blocked either version released by Orson Welles from being sold . This version runs to 91 minutes

Several German commercial film producers expressed an interest in making films with Fassbinder .

		CONTEXT='' Arrival and Departure '' ( 1943 ) is the third novel of Arthur Koestler 's trilogy concerning the conflict between morality and expedience ( as described in the postscript to the novel 's 1966 Danube Edition ) . The first volume , '' The Gladiators '' , is about the subversion of the Spartacus revolt , and the second , '' Darkness at Noon '' , is the celebrated novel about the Soviet Show trials . '' Arrival and Departure '' was Koestler 's first full-length work in English , '' The Gladiators '' and '' Darkness at Noon '' were originally written in German . It is often considered to be the weakest of the three . Reviewing the novel in December 1943 George Orwell called it notable " for what must be one of the most shocking descriptions of Nazi terrorism that have ever been written . " Written during the middle of World War II , '' Arrival and Departure '' reflects Koestler 's own plight as a Hungarian refugee . Like Koestler , the main character is a former member of the Communist party . He escapes to ' Neutralia ' , a neutral country based on Portugal , where Koestler himself had gone , and flees from there . ( Stephen Spender had supposedly said of Neutralia , " Names like that should not be allowed in novels ! " ) Reflecting Koestler 's later life relationship with science , and particularly his disagreement with various movements within psychiatry , the main character emerges from treatment psychically neutered , and the critical question of the novel is how much of his later trauma and political activity is due to a small incident in his childhood

The site 's critical consensus states , " Vibrant and charming , '' Stranger Things '' transforms itself into a riveting — if familiar — summer ride that basks in its neon-laden nostalgia without losing sight of the rich relationships that make the series so endearing . " On Metacritic , the third season has a weighted average score of 72 out of 100 , based on 24 critics , indicating " generally favorable reviews . " Writing in the '' New Statesman '' , Emily Bootle considered the third season an improvement on the second : " ... after a confused and rambling season two , the third season of Stranger Things is a return to strength – where season two had something of an identity crisis , season three has largely brought back what made the show unique in the first place . " Hugh Montgomery at ''BBC.com '' awarded 5 stars , describing the third season as " an exhilarating example of a franchise hitting new heights that Hollywood would do well to learn from . " On the dissenting side , Darren Franich of '' Entertainment Weekly '' criticized the third season for looking like a Reagan-era pop culture mixtape . Ed Power of '' The Telegraph '' blamed Duffer Brothers for refusing " to stray from the Goonies-meets-Stephen King formula " and recycling their " well-worn bag of retro references to increasingly underwhelming effect " , producing the limpest installment of the three . His opinion was echoed by Hank Stuever of '' The Washington Post '' , who felt almost heartbroken for " the Duffers working so hard to re-create an elusive vibe " of 1980s with a " mishmash of ingredients : John Carpenter , Steven Spielberg , Stephen King , Freddy Krueger , Rambo , the Terminator , the aliens of LV-426 " only to fail to create a fully entertaining show . Writing in '' National Review '' , Daniel Payne criticized the season 's " sloppy storytelling " and " cornball humor " compared to the previous seasons , claiming that season three was " frenetic and bewildering where the first two seasons were slow , careful , and rewarding in crafting their plots .

'' Billboard '' described the album as " supreme " and " very human ... it satisfies with moments of darkness , enlightenment , anger , bittersweet tension , and happiness ... Although 2002 is still young , consider '' Under Rug Swept '' one of the year 's best . " '' Q '' magazine said the album was " a smart shot across the bows ... some of the most inviting music of her career ... Morissette has fashioned a lyrical Trojan Horse to be wheeled into unsuspecting homes for months to come . " Robert Christgau wrote , " The pop-rock here lacks the faux-punk edge on '' Jagged Little Pill '' ... But Morissette instantly demonstrates her gift for the catchy ... topping memorable verse with indelible chorus , she 's a self-actualized nut who goes for what she wants , exactly as pretentious as the college girls she represents for . " According to '' LA Weekly '' , the album " is Alanis Morissette in top form , exercising her God-given right to vent and sound beautiful doing so . " Other critical appraisals were less favorable . '' Rolling Stone '' , in a three-star review , wrote " The music is brawny and meticulous ... but '' Under Rug Swept '' just about drowns in psychobabble . While the tone of the songs , and the grain of Morissette 's voice , promise intimacy , there 's hardly a private detail anywhere . " '' Entertainment Weekly '' said " the album 's garbled title is also preparation for some of the clumsiest lyrics to be heard on a pop record in years ... The songs are riddled with such overwritten Psych 101 ruminations . " '' The Village Voice '' criticised the lyrics , saying " Much like even non-football fans used to be mesmerized by Howard Cosell 's genius for never using two words when 23 would do , you do n't have to be a love-damaged 17-year-old girl to find '' Under Rug Swept '' 's dense verbiage a trip . Words tumble forth and arrange themselves kaleidoscopically into all sorts of unusual categories ... I 'm just not sure that pop music should come out of a thesaurus . " '' NME '' called it " a tedious album " with " overwrought folk-rock like ' Surrendering ' and ' Hands Clean ' destined for a thousand organic juice bars . Lyrically , it 's often hilarious ... This record moves way beyond armchair psychology — in fact , there are armchairs that have a cannier grasp of the mind . " '' Under Rug Swept '' received a Juno Award nomination in the category of " Pop Album of the Year " . Morissette herself won the " Jack Richardson Producer of the Year " award for the songs " Hands Clean " and " So Unsexy " , and she was nominated in the " Artist of the Year " category .

" According to '' LA Weekly '' , the album " is Alanis Morissette in top form , exercising her God-given right to vent and sound beautiful doing so . " Other critical appraisals were less favorable .

		CONTEXT=Reviews of '' Under Rug Swept '' on its release were generally positive . '' Billboard '' described the album as " supreme " and " very human ... it satisfies with moments of darkness , enlightenment , anger , bittersweet tension , and happiness ... Although 2002 is still young , consider '' Under Rug Swept '' one of the year 's best . " '' Q '' magazine said the album was " a smart shot across the bows ... some of the most inviting music of her career ... Morissette has fashioned a lyrical Trojan Horse to be wheeled into unsuspecting homes for months to come . " Robert Christgau wrote , " The pop-rock here lacks the faux-punk edge on '' Jagged Little Pill '' ... But Morissette instantly demonstrates her gift for the catchy ... topping memorable verse with indelible chorus , she 's a self-actualized nut who goes for what she wants , exactly as pretentious as the college girls she represents for . " According to '' LA Weekly '' , the album " is Alanis Morissette in top form , exercising her God-given right to vent and sound beautiful doing so . " Other critical appraisals were less favorable . '' Rolling Stone '' , in a three-star review , wrote " The music is brawny and meticulous ... but '' Under Rug Swept '' just about drowns in psychobabble . While the tone of the songs , and the grain of Morissette 's voice , promise intimacy , there 's hardly a private detail anywhere . " '' Entertainment Weekly '' said " the album 's garbled title is also preparation for some of the clumsiest lyrics to be heard on a pop record in years ... The songs are riddled with such overwritten Psych 101 ruminations . " '' The Village Voice '' criticised the lyrics , saying " Much like even non-football fans used to be mesmerized by Howard Cosell 's genius for never using two words when 23 would do , you do n't have to be a love-damaged 17-year-old girl to find '' Under Rug Swept '' 's dense verbiage a trip . Words tumble forth and arrange themselves kaleidoscopically into all sorts of unusual categories ... I 'm just not sure that pop music should come out of a thesaurus . " '' NME '' called it " a tedious album " with " overwrought folk-rock like ' Surrendering ' and ' Hands Clean ' destined for a thousand organic juice bars . Lyrically , it 's often hilarious ... This record moves way beyond armchair psychology — in fact , there are armchairs that have a cannier grasp of the mind . " '' Under Rug Swept '' received a Juno Award nomination in the category of " Pop Album of the Year " . Morissette herself won the " Jack Richardson Producer of the Year " award for the songs " Hands Clean " and " So Unsexy " , and she was nominated in the " Artist of the Year " category . ( For more information , see Juno Awards of 2003 . ) '' Under Rug Swept '' entered the Canadian albums chart at number one with first week sales of 35,000 copies , and the CRIA certified it platinum the following month for shipments of 100,000 . In the U.S. the album sold 215,000 copies in its first week , debuting at number one on the '' Billboard '' 200 chart during a busy sales week following the 2002 Grammy Awards ceremony ; it stayed in the top spot for a week . Within a month of release it had sold 500,000 copies , and the RIAA certified it platinum for shipments of over one million .

		CONTEXT=In 1990 Rafelson directed '' Mountains of the Moon '' , a film about the 1857 – 58 journey of Richard Francis Burton and John Hanning Speke in their expedition to central Africa — the project that culminated in Speke 's discovery of the source of the Nile River . It starred Patrick Bergin as Burton and Iain Glen as Speke , and was hailed by critic Roger Ebert as " completely absorbing . " Ebert continued , " It tells its story soberly and intelligently , and with quiet style ... It 's the kind of movie that sends you away from the screen filled with curiosity to know more about this man Burton . " In '' Newsweek '' , critic Jack Kroll wrote , " The exploits of Sir Richard Francis Burton make Lawrence of Arabia look like a tourist . . . . From scene to scene this film grips you as few movies do , moving between Africa and England to spotlight an extraordinary range of characters in both ' primitive ' and ' civilized ' cultures : from the African tribal chiefs , mild or murderous , to the nabobs of the Royal Geographical Society , honest or treacherous . " Rafelson later observed , " I was very lucky to make that movie . And I can tell you , if there was ever a movie that I enjoyed making , it was that one . " In 1992 Rafelson teamed up with Nicholson and '' Five Easy Pieces '' screenwriter Carole Eastman for the film '' Man Trouble '' . In 1996 he made his last film with Nicholson to date , '' Blood and Wine '' . His most recent films are 1998 's '' Poodle Springs '' and 2002 's '' No Good Deed '' , based on works by Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett , respectively . '' No Good Deed '' was entered into the 24th Moscow International Film Festival

Moderately successful , she lived a life of luxury , entertaining many of the literary figures of the day . Under Two Flags , one of her most famous novels , described the British in Algeria .

Her novel A Dog of Flanders is considered a children 's classic in much of Asia . The American author Jack London cited her novel Signa , as one of the reasons for his literary success . Her lavish lifestyle eventually led her to penury , and her works were put up for auction to pay her debts . She died in Italy from pneumonia .

Caragiale 's style , associated with Symbolism , the Decadent movement of the fin de siècle , and early modernism , was an original element in the Romanian literature of the interwar period . In other late contributions , Caragiale pioneered detective fiction locally , but there is disagreement over whether his work in the field produced a complete narrative or just fragments . The scarcity of writings he left is contrasted by their critical acclaim and a large , mostly posthumous , following , commonly known as mateists .

		CONTEXT=Karlsplatz Stadtbahn Station is a former station of the Viennese Stadtbahn . The buildings above ground on Karlsplatz are a well - known example of Jugendstil architecture . These buildings were included in The Vienna Secession , as they followed many of the artistic styles of that movement . They were designed by Otto Wagner , adviser to the Transport Commission in Vienna , and Joseph Maria Olbrich and are , unlike the other Stadtbahn stations , made of a steel framework with marble slabs mounted on the exterior . These stations allowed Otto Wagner to achieve his goal of creating two modern axes of architecture in a city that was becoming one of the most modern cities of its time . These buildings went on to become the most modern monument of the modern city . Architectural critic and poet Friedrich Achleitner commented on the Stadtbahn stations as follows " ... In these two station buildings Wagner reached a highpoint of his dialectic ( in his planning of the Stadtbahn ) between function and poetry , construction and decoration , whereby a severe rationalism engages in competition with an almost Secessionist kind of decoration .

In the 1940s , Story was an important magazine in that it published the first or early works of many writers who went on to become major authors . Not only did Burnett prove to be a valuable literary birddog for new talent , but Story remained a respectable though low - paying ( typically $ 25 per story ) alternative for stories rejected by the large - circulation slick magazines published on glossy paper like Collier 's or The Saturday Evening Post or the somewhat more prestigious and literary slick magazines such as The New Yorker .

'' Billboard '' described the album as " supreme " and " very human ... it satisfies with moments of darkness , enlightenment , anger , bittersweet tension , and happiness ... Although 2002 is still young , consider '' Under Rug Swept '' one of the year 's best . " '' Q '' magazine said the album was " a smart shot across the bows ... some of the most inviting music of her career ... Morissette has fashioned a lyrical Trojan Horse to be wheeled into unsuspecting homes for months to come . " Robert Christgau wrote , " The pop-rock here lacks the faux-punk edge on '' Jagged Little Pill '' ... But Morissette instantly demonstrates her gift for the catchy ... topping memorable verse with indelible chorus , she 's a self-actualized nut who goes for what she wants , exactly as pretentious as the college girls she represents for . " According to '' LA Weekly '' , the album " is Alanis Morissette in top form , exercising her God-given right to vent and sound beautiful doing so . " Other critical appraisals were less favorable . '' Rolling Stone '' , in a three-star review , wrote " The music is brawny and meticulous ... but '' Under Rug Swept '' just about drowns in psychobabble . While the tone of the songs , and the grain of Morissette 's voice , promise intimacy , there 's hardly a private detail anywhere . " '' Entertainment Weekly '' said " the album 's garbled title is also preparation for some of the clumsiest lyrics to be heard on a pop record in years ... The songs are riddled with such overwritten Psych 101 ruminations . " '' The Village Voice '' criticised the lyrics , saying " Much like even non-football fans used to be mesmerized by Howard Cosell 's genius for never using two words when 23 would do , you do n't have to be a love-damaged 17-year-old girl to find '' Under Rug Swept '' 's dense verbiage a trip . Words tumble forth and arrange themselves kaleidoscopically into all sorts of unusual categories ... I 'm just not sure that pop music should come out of a thesaurus . " '' NME '' called it " a tedious album " with " overwrought folk-rock like ' Surrendering ' and ' Hands Clean ' destined for a thousand organic juice bars . Lyrically , it 's often hilarious ... This record moves way beyond armchair psychology — in fact , there are armchairs that have a cannier grasp of the mind . " '' Under Rug Swept '' received a Juno Award nomination in the category of " Pop Album of the Year " . Morissette herself won the " Jack Richardson Producer of the Year " award for the songs " Hands Clean " and " So Unsexy " , and she was nominated in the " Artist of the Year " category . ( For more information , see Juno Awards of 2003 . ) '' Under Rug Swept '' entered the Canadian albums chart at number one with first week sales of 35,000 copies , and the CRIA certified it platinum the following month for shipments of 100,000 .

		CONTEXT=President François Tombalbaye faced a task of considerable magnitude when Chad became a sovereign state in 1960 . His challenge was to build a nation out of a vast and diverse territory that had poor communications , few known resources , a tiny market , and a collection of impoverished people with sharply differing political traditions , ethnic and regional loyalties , and sociocultural patterns . The French colonial powers that had created the country 's boundaries had done little to promote economic interdependence , political cooperation , or crosscultural understanding . Chadians who had hoped that the country 's first president might turn out to be a state builder like the 13th century 's Dabbalemi or the 16th century 's Aluma were soon disappointed . During its first fifteen years , Chad under Tombalbaye experienced worsening economic conditions , eventual alienation of the most patient of foreign allies , exacerbation of ethnic and regional conflict , and grave weakening of the state as an instrument of governance .

Over the previous year , British Royal Navy squadrons had isolated and defeated the French Caribbean colonies one by one , until by the autumn Guadeloupe was the only colony remaining in French hands . Cut off from the rest of the world by British blockade squadrons that intercepted all ships coming to or from the island , Guadeloupe was in a desperate situation , facing economic collapse , food shortages and social upheaval , as well as the impending threat of British invasion . In an effort to reinforce and resupply the colony , the French government sent four vessels to the West Indies in November 1809 under Commodore François Roquebert . Two of the ships were 20 - gun flûtes carrying supplies and troops . The two others were 40 - gun frigates , ordered to protect the storeships on their journey from the British forces operating off both the French and Guadeloupe coasts .

		CONTEXT=Reviews of '' Under Rug Swept '' on its release were generally positive . '' Billboard '' described the album as " supreme " and " very human ... it satisfies with moments of darkness , enlightenment , anger , bittersweet tension , and happiness ... Although 2002 is still young , consider '' Under Rug Swept '' one of the year 's best . " '' Q '' magazine said the album was " a smart shot across the bows ... some of the most inviting music of her career ... Morissette has fashioned a lyrical Trojan Horse to be wheeled into unsuspecting homes for months to come . " Robert Christgau wrote , " The pop-rock here lacks the faux-punk edge on '' Jagged Little Pill '' ... But Morissette instantly demonstrates her gift for the catchy ... topping memorable verse with indelible chorus , she 's a self-actualized nut who goes for what she wants , exactly as pretentious as the college girls she represents for . " According to '' LA Weekly '' , the album " is Alanis Morissette in top form , exercising her God-given right to vent and sound beautiful doing so . " Other critical appraisals were less favorable . '' Rolling Stone '' , in a three-star review , wrote " The music is brawny and meticulous ... but '' Under Rug Swept '' just about drowns in psychobabble . While the tone of the songs , and the grain of Morissette 's voice , promise intimacy , there 's hardly a private detail anywhere . " '' Entertainment Weekly '' said " the album 's garbled title is also preparation for some of the clumsiest lyrics to be heard on a pop record in years ... The songs are riddled with such overwritten Psych 101 ruminations . " '' The Village Voice '' criticised the lyrics , saying " Much like even non-football fans used to be mesmerized by Howard Cosell 's genius for never using two words when 23 would do , you do n't have to be a love-damaged 17-year-old girl to find '' Under Rug Swept '' 's dense verbiage a trip . Words tumble forth and arrange themselves kaleidoscopically into all sorts of unusual categories ... I 'm just not sure that pop music should come out of a thesaurus . " '' NME '' called it " a tedious album " with " overwrought folk-rock like ' Surrendering ' and ' Hands Clean ' destined for a thousand organic juice bars . Lyrically , it 's often hilarious ... This record moves way beyond armchair psychology — in fact , there are armchairs that have a cannier grasp of the mind . " '' Under Rug Swept '' received a Juno Award nomination in the category of " Pop Album of the Year " . Morissette herself won the " Jack Richardson Producer of the Year " award for the songs " Hands Clean " and " So Unsexy " , and she was nominated in the " Artist of the Year " category . ( For more information , see Juno Awards of 2003 . ) '' Under Rug Swept '' entered the Canadian albums chart at number one with first week sales of 35,000 copies , and the CRIA certified it platinum the following month for shipments of 100,000 . In the U.S. the album sold 215,000 copies in its first week , debuting at number one on the '' Billboard '' 200 chart during a busy sales week following the 2002 Grammy Awards ceremony ; it stayed in the top spot for a week . Within a month of release it had sold 500,000 copies , and the RIAA certified it platinum for shipments of over one million .

		CONTEXT=The first feature film Ján Kadár and Elmar Klos were able to make in five years showed a decided return to classical black-and-white filmmaking with barely a trace of Kadár 's more experimental work at the '' Laterna magika '' . A gradual relaxation of communist control in Czechoslovakia , whose first signs came from Slovakia , enabled the Bratislava journalist and writer Ladislav Mňačko to publish his novel '' Death Is Called Engelchen '' ( '' Smrť sa volá Engelchen '' , 1959 ) and Kadár and Klos to reach for it from Prague after their suspension was over . The novel and their film '' Death is Called Engelchen '' ( , , 1963 ) spotlighted a new take on the massive pro-democratic Slovak revolt of 1944 that had previously been portrayed only as invariably glorious . It showed some of its aspects that brought about human tragedy . The film was entered into the 3rd Moscow International Film Festival where it won a Golden Prize . The directors ' next film , '' Accused '' aka '' Defendant '' ( '' Obžalovaný '' , 1964 ) , rehashed the propagandist structures of the earlier Socialist-Realist filmmaking , but turned them around by replacing the content mandated in the 1950s with committed social criticism that was quickly becoming one of the hallmarks of Slovak and Czech cinema of the 1960s

" No Reptiles " supposes that political leaders are " just fat , bald , old men , like soft-boiled eggs , that are just weak-willed , with no strong feelings ( good or ill ) " ; its lyrics also make cryptic reference to Elliot Rodger , who carried out the 2014 Isla Vista killings

		CONTEXT=Greg Hunt was appointed Minister for the Environment . Hunt , a former Fulbright scholar , and human rights and development activist with the United Nations , had held the Shadow portfolio under successive Liberal leaders . The portfolio of Climate Change was abolished . The Abbottled Opposition campaigned on a promise of replacing the Rudd-Gillard Government 's carbon pricing system with a " direct action against climate change " policy . In July 2014 , the Abbott Government followed through with this commitment , becoming the first developed nation to repeal a carbon price and foregoing government revenue of $ 24 billion from polluters through to 2020 . Prior to becoming Opposition Leader , Abbott initially supported proposals by Liberal leaders Howard and Turnbull to introduce floating prices to reduce carbon emissions , but also expressed some doubts as to the science and economics underlying such initiatives . On the eve of the 2013 election , Abbott stated during an interview on the ABC TV '' Insiders '' that : On 19 September , Hunt abolished the advisory Climate Commission , stating that this move formed " part of the Coalition 's plans to streamline government processes and avoid duplication of services " and that the Department of the Environment would take on its role . Hunt has also stated that the government will abolish the Climate Change Authority and Clean Energy Finance Corporation . In October Abbott and Hunt disputed statements from Christiana Figueres , the head of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change , that the 2013 New South Wales bushfires were probably linked to climate change and that the government 's Direct Action policy would be harmful , with Abbott stating that Figueres was " talking through her hat "

'' Billboard '' described the album as " supreme " and " very human ... it satisfies with moments of darkness , enlightenment , anger , bittersweet tension , and happiness ... Although 2002 is still young , consider '' Under Rug Swept '' one of the year 's best . " '' Q '' magazine said the album was " a smart shot across the bows ... some of the most inviting music of her career ... Morissette has fashioned a lyrical Trojan Horse to be wheeled into unsuspecting homes for months to come . " Robert Christgau wrote , " The pop-rock here lacks the faux-punk edge on '' Jagged Little Pill '' ... But Morissette instantly demonstrates her gift for the catchy ... topping memorable verse with indelible chorus , she 's a self-actualized nut who goes for what she wants , exactly as pretentious as the college girls she represents for . " According to '' LA Weekly '' , the album " is Alanis Morissette in top form , exercising her God-given right to vent and sound beautiful doing so . " Other critical appraisals were less favorable . '' Rolling Stone '' , in a three-star review , wrote " The music is brawny and meticulous ... but '' Under Rug Swept '' just about drowns in psychobabble . While the tone of the songs , and the grain of Morissette 's voice , promise intimacy , there 's hardly a private detail anywhere . " '' Entertainment Weekly '' said " the album 's garbled title is also preparation for some of the clumsiest lyrics to be heard on a pop record in years ... The songs are riddled with such overwritten Psych 101 ruminations . " '' The Village Voice '' criticised the lyrics , saying " Much like even non-football fans used to be mesmerized by Howard Cosell 's genius for never using two words when 23 would do , you do n't have to be a love-damaged 17-year-old girl to find '' Under Rug Swept '' 's dense verbiage a trip . Words tumble forth and arrange themselves kaleidoscopically into all sorts of unusual categories ... I 'm just not sure that pop music should come out of a thesaurus . " '' NME '' called it " a tedious album " with " overwrought folk-rock like ' Surrendering ' and ' Hands Clean ' destined for a thousand organic juice bars . Lyrically , it 's often hilarious ... This record moves way beyond armchair psychology — in fact , there are armchairs that have a cannier grasp of the mind . " '' Under Rug Swept '' received a Juno Award nomination in the category of " Pop Album of the Year " . Morissette herself won the " Jack Richardson Producer of the Year " award for the songs " Hands Clean " and " So Unsexy " , and she was nominated in the " Artist of the Year " category .

But it does n’t stop there . FlyLo shows off his talent by shifting gears post-Kendrick verse the only way you can : insane keys , double-time bass drum , and unrelenting hand claps . Eventually , it ’s all swallowed up in massive swelling synth and choral hums , fading to a beautiful , passionate outro .

		CONTEXT=In 1990 Rafelson directed '' Mountains of the Moon '' , a film about the 1857 – 58 journey of Richard Francis Burton and John Hanning Speke in their expedition to central Africa — the project that culminated in Speke 's discovery of the source of the Nile River . It starred Patrick Bergin as Burton and Iain Glen as Speke , and was hailed by critic Roger Ebert as " completely absorbing . " Ebert continued , " It tells its story soberly and intelligently , and with quiet style ... It 's the kind of movie that sends you away from the screen filled with curiosity to know more about this man Burton . " In '' Newsweek '' , critic Jack Kroll wrote , " The exploits of Sir Richard Francis Burton make Lawrence of Arabia look like a tourist . . . . From scene to scene this film grips you as few movies do , moving between Africa and England to spotlight an extraordinary range of characters in both ' primitive ' and ' civilized ' cultures : from the African tribal chiefs , mild or murderous , to the nabobs of the Royal Geographical Society , honest or treacherous . " Rafelson later observed , " I was very lucky to make that movie . And I can tell you , if there was ever a movie that I enjoyed making , it was that one . " In 1992 Rafelson teamed up with Nicholson and '' Five Easy Pieces '' screenwriter Carole Eastman for the film '' Man Trouble '' . In 1996 he made his last film with Nicholson to date , '' Blood and Wine '' . His most recent films are 1998 's '' Poodle Springs '' and 2002 's '' No Good Deed '' , based on works by Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett , respectively .

'' Billboard '' described the album as " supreme " and " very human ... it satisfies with moments of darkness , enlightenment , anger , bittersweet tension , and happiness ... Although 2002 is still young , consider '' Under Rug Swept '' one of the year 's best . " '' Q '' magazine said the album was " a smart shot across the bows ... some of the most inviting music of her career ... Morissette has fashioned a lyrical Trojan Horse to be wheeled into unsuspecting homes for months to come . " Robert Christgau wrote , " The pop-rock here lacks the faux-punk edge on '' Jagged Little Pill '' ... But Morissette instantly demonstrates her gift for the catchy ... topping memorable verse with indelible chorus , she 's a self-actualized nut who goes for what she wants , exactly as pretentious as the college girls she represents for . " According to '' LA Weekly '' , the album " is Alanis Morissette in top form , exercising her God-given right to vent and sound beautiful doing so . " Other critical appraisals were less favorable . '' Rolling Stone '' , in a three-star review , wrote " The music is brawny and meticulous ... but '' Under Rug Swept '' just about drowns in psychobabble . While the tone of the songs , and the grain of Morissette 's voice , promise intimacy , there 's hardly a private detail anywhere . " '' Entertainment Weekly '' said " the album 's garbled title is also preparation for some of the clumsiest lyrics to be heard on a pop record in years ... The songs are riddled with such overwritten Psych 101 ruminations . " '' The Village Voice '' criticised the lyrics , saying " Much like even non-football fans used to be mesmerized by Howard Cosell 's genius for never using two words when 23 would do , you do n't have to be a love-damaged 17-year-old girl to find '' Under Rug Swept '' 's dense verbiage a trip . Words tumble forth and arrange themselves kaleidoscopically into all sorts of unusual categories ... I 'm just not sure that pop music should come out of a thesaurus . " '' NME '' called it " a tedious album " with " overwrought folk-rock like ' Surrendering ' and ' Hands Clean ' destined for a thousand organic juice bars . Lyrically , it 's often hilarious ... This record moves way beyond armchair psychology — in fact , there are armchairs that have a cannier grasp of the mind . " '' Under Rug Swept '' received a Juno Award nomination in the category of " Pop Album of the Year " . Morissette herself won the " Jack Richardson Producer of the Year " award for the songs " Hands Clean " and " So Unsexy " , and she was nominated in the " Artist of the Year " category . ( For more information , see Juno Awards of 2003 . ) '' Under Rug Swept '' entered the Canadian albums chart at number one with first week sales of 35,000 copies , and the CRIA certified it platinum the following month for shipments of 100,000 . In the U.S. the album sold 215,000 copies in its first week , debuting at number one on the '' Billboard '' 200 chart during a busy sales week following the 2002 Grammy Awards ceremony ; it stayed in the top spot for a week .

		CONTEXT=Reviews of '' Under Rug Swept '' on its release were generally positive . '' Billboard '' described the album as " supreme " and " very human ... it satisfies with moments of darkness , enlightenment , anger , bittersweet tension , and happiness ... Although 2002 is still young , consider '' Under Rug Swept '' one of the year 's best . " '' Q '' magazine said the album was " a smart shot across the bows ... some of the most inviting music of her career ... Morissette has fashioned a lyrical Trojan Horse to be wheeled into unsuspecting homes for months to come . " Robert Christgau wrote , " The pop-rock here lacks the faux-punk edge on '' Jagged Little Pill '' ... But Morissette instantly demonstrates her gift for the catchy ... topping memorable verse with indelible chorus , she 's a self-actualized nut who goes for what she wants , exactly as pretentious as the college girls she represents for . " According to '' LA Weekly '' , the album " is Alanis Morissette in top form , exercising her God-given right to vent and sound beautiful doing so . " Other critical appraisals were less favorable . '' Rolling Stone '' , in a three-star review , wrote " The music is brawny and meticulous ... but '' Under Rug Swept '' just about drowns in psychobabble . While the tone of the songs , and the grain of Morissette 's voice , promise intimacy , there 's hardly a private detail anywhere . " '' Entertainment Weekly '' said " the album 's garbled title is also preparation for some of the clumsiest lyrics to be heard on a pop record in years ... The songs are riddled with such overwritten Psych 101 ruminations . " '' The Village Voice '' criticised the lyrics , saying " Much like even non-football fans used to be mesmerized by Howard Cosell 's genius for never using two words when 23 would do , you do n't have to be a love-damaged 17-year-old girl to find '' Under Rug Swept '' 's dense verbiage a trip . Words tumble forth and arrange themselves kaleidoscopically into all sorts of unusual categories ... I 'm just not sure that pop music should come out of a thesaurus . " '' NME '' called it " a tedious album " with " overwrought folk-rock like ' Surrendering ' and ' Hands Clean ' destined for a thousand organic juice bars . Lyrically , it 's often hilarious ... This record moves way beyond armchair psychology — in fact , there are armchairs that have a cannier grasp of the mind . " '' Under Rug Swept '' received a Juno Award nomination in the category of " Pop Album of the Year " . Morissette herself won the " Jack Richardson Producer of the Year " award for the songs " Hands Clean " and " So Unsexy " , and she was nominated in the " Artist of the Year " category . ( For more information , see Juno Awards of 2003 . ) '' Under Rug Swept '' entered the Canadian albums chart at number one with first week sales of 35,000 copies , and the CRIA certified it platinum the following month for shipments of 100,000 . In the U.S. the album sold 215,000 copies in its first week , debuting at number one on the '' Billboard '' 200 chart during a busy sales week following the 2002 Grammy Awards ceremony ; it stayed in the top spot for a week . Within a month of release it had sold 500,000 copies , and the RIAA certified it platinum for shipments of over one million .

'' Billboard '' described the album as " supreme " and " very human ... it satisfies with moments of darkness , enlightenment , anger , bittersweet tension , and happiness ... Although 2002 is still young , consider '' Under Rug Swept '' one of the year 's best . " '' Q '' magazine said the album was " a smart shot across the bows ... some of the most inviting music of her career ... Morissette has fashioned a lyrical Trojan Horse to be wheeled into unsuspecting homes for months to come . " Robert Christgau wrote , " The pop-rock here lacks the faux-punk edge on '' Jagged Little Pill '' ... But Morissette instantly demonstrates her gift for the catchy ... topping memorable verse with indelible chorus , she 's a self-actualized nut who goes for what she wants , exactly as pretentious as the college girls she represents for . " According to '' LA Weekly '' , the album " is Alanis Morissette in top form , exercising her God-given right to vent and sound beautiful doing so . " Other critical appraisals were less favorable . '' Rolling Stone '' , in a three-star review , wrote " The music is brawny and meticulous ... but '' Under Rug Swept '' just about drowns in psychobabble . While the tone of the songs , and the grain of Morissette 's voice , promise intimacy , there 's hardly a private detail anywhere . " '' Entertainment Weekly '' said " the album 's garbled title is also preparation for some of the clumsiest lyrics to be heard on a pop record in years ... The songs are riddled with such overwritten Psych 101 ruminations . " '' The Village Voice '' criticised the lyrics , saying " Much like even non-football fans used to be mesmerized by Howard Cosell 's genius for never using two words when 23 would do , you do n't have to be a love-damaged 17-year-old girl to find '' Under Rug Swept '' 's dense verbiage a trip . Words tumble forth and arrange themselves kaleidoscopically into all sorts of unusual categories ... I 'm just not sure that pop music should come out of a thesaurus . " '' NME '' called it " a tedious album " with " overwrought folk-rock like ' Surrendering ' and ' Hands Clean ' destined for a thousand organic juice bars . Lyrically , it 's often hilarious ... This record moves way beyond armchair psychology — in fact , there are armchairs that have a cannier grasp of the mind . " '' Under Rug Swept '' received a Juno Award nomination in the category of " Pop Album of the Year " . Morissette herself won the " Jack Richardson Producer of the Year " award for the songs " Hands Clean " and " So Unsexy " , and she was nominated in the " Artist of the Year " category . ( For more information , see Juno Awards of 2003 . ) '' Under Rug Swept '' entered the Canadian albums chart at number one with first week sales of 35,000 copies , and the CRIA certified it platinum the following month for shipments of 100,000 . In the U.S. the album sold 215,000 copies in its first week , debuting at number one on the '' Billboard '' 200 chart during a busy sales week following the 2002 Grammy Awards ceremony ; it stayed in the top spot for a week . Within a month of release it had sold 500,000 copies , and the RIAA certified it platinum for shipments of over one million .

It was also the UK 's strongest showing since winning the 1981 Contest with " Making Your Mind Up . " The song was a contemporary ballad about a man and a woman who are both too afraid to plunge head-first with their emotions into a love affair ; while both of them want to be loved by the other , both of them are letting their heads rule their hearts . In the chorus , Vikki sings that " love is " the product of a number of impulsive decisions , such as " taking a chance on two hearts beating as one . " Vikki nominally used a single chair as a prop , first sitting in it while singing the song , then circling it and abandoning it entirely by the second half of the song

" Vincentelli also noted that Weaver 's character had " turned her life into a performance . " The play received six Tony Award nominations for the 67th Tony Awards , winning the Tony Award for Best Play . Magnussen earned his first Tony nomination for his role .

On May 27 , 2014 Cyrus performed the song during the World Music Awards held in Monte Carlo , Monaco ; where she also won four World Music Awards . She wore a gown with a scenic theme based on flowers during the performance . It received positive reviews for its understated simplicity and strong vocal delivery . Cyrus returned to perform the song during the musical festival on June 21 , 2014 , Summertime Ball at Wembley Stadium of London , in front of 80,000 people . Cyrus has performed the song during her ongoing Bangerz Tour . A critic from the '' Nashville Scene '' praised the performance , writing , " Wrecking Ball was sung by Miley and earnestly shouted in unison by the arena , some of the audience tearing up . " Blake Hannon praised Cyrus ' vocal delivery , writing , " The crowd kept going when things slowed down for Wrecking Ball . It was the highlight of the night , and not because of anything visual . The costumed characters vanished and the screen was black , with Cyrus belting out one of the best pop power ballads in recent memory with only a smattering of lights . It 's a reminder that beneath it all , Cyrus has a voice — and a pretty big one , at that . " In September 2013 , British singer-songwriter James Arthur covered " Wrecking Ball " on Radio Hamburg in Germany . Later that month , The Gregory Brothers released a country version , which Laura Vitto from Mashable felt " trades in Miley 's pop-ballad sound for a twangier feel .

		CONTEXT=Reviews of '' Under Rug Swept '' on its release were generally positive . '' Billboard '' described the album as " supreme " and " very human ... it satisfies with moments of darkness , enlightenment , anger , bittersweet tension , and happiness ... Although 2002 is still young , consider '' Under Rug Swept '' one of the year 's best . " '' Q '' magazine said the album was " a smart shot across the bows ... some of the most inviting music of her career ... Morissette has fashioned a lyrical Trojan Horse to be wheeled into unsuspecting homes for months to come . " Robert Christgau wrote , " The pop-rock here lacks the faux-punk edge on '' Jagged Little Pill '' ... But Morissette instantly demonstrates her gift for the catchy ... topping memorable verse with indelible chorus , she 's a self-actualized nut who goes for what she wants , exactly as pretentious as the college girls she represents for . " According to '' LA Weekly '' , the album " is Alanis Morissette in top form , exercising her God-given right to vent and sound beautiful doing so . " Other critical appraisals were less favorable . '' Rolling Stone '' , in a three-star review , wrote " The music is brawny and meticulous ... but '' Under Rug Swept '' just about drowns in psychobabble . While the tone of the songs , and the grain of Morissette 's voice , promise intimacy , there 's hardly a private detail anywhere . " '' Entertainment Weekly '' said " the album 's garbled title is also preparation for some of the clumsiest lyrics to be heard on a pop record in years ... The songs are riddled with such overwritten Psych 101 ruminations . " '' The Village Voice '' criticised the lyrics , saying " Much like even non-football fans used to be mesmerized by Howard Cosell 's genius for never using two words when 23 would do , you do n't have to be a love-damaged 17-year-old girl to find '' Under Rug Swept '' 's dense verbiage a trip . Words tumble forth and arrange themselves kaleidoscopically into all sorts of unusual categories ... I 'm just not sure that pop music should come out of a thesaurus .

		CONTEXT=Music critics favorably reviewed " Never Catch Me " . Named Best New Track by '' Pitchfork Media '' , editor Jayson Greene praised Lamar 's performance , writing " his hyper-vaulting flow and embedded rhyme patterns within rhyme patterns " . For its year-end list of " The 100 Best Tracks of 2014 " , '' Pitchfork '' ranked the song at number 23 . Also commenting on Lamar , '' Billboard '' 's Chris Payne wrote , " There are n't many A-list rappers who could handle a beat like this , but Kendrick is clearly one of them . " '' Rolling Stone '' editor Jon Dolan gave the song three-and-a-half out of five stars , commenting " Over offhandedly lovely , warp-speed psychedelic soul-jazz , Lamar unleashes a word-mad waterfall with a worried emotional core ( " analyze my demise I say I 'm super-anxious " , he raps ) . " '' Consequence of Sound '' editor Nina Corcoran wrote : " when combined with one of Lamar ’s hottest verses to date ( before '' To Pimp a Butterfly '' ) , the song explodes . But it does n’t stop there . FlyLo shows off his talent by shifting gears post-Kendrick verse the only way you can : insane keys , double-time bass drum , and unrelenting hand claps . Eventually , it ’s all swallowed up in massive swelling synth and choral hums , fading to a beautiful , passionate outro . " Directed by Hiro Murai , the video begins at a funeral ( including attendees Flying Lotus and Thundercat in cameo roles ) . Seemingly a sad video , it turns instantly joyful when the two late children - a boy and a girl - bound out of their caskets at the front of the church and dance gleefully down the aisle . The mourners ca n't see the children as they dance right out of the church and out onto a blacktop , but a group of other kids chases after them as they hop in a hearse and drive away . The clip was featured by several publications on their year-end list of best videos , including '' Pitchfork '' , '' Spin '' , and Stereogumwith the latter listing it at number one . The video received two nominations at the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards : Best Choreography and Best Cinematography , ultimately winning the latter

Within the Conservative government the political impact was immense . While the Government had not wanted to engage in a major fight in 1984 at the same time as the miners ' strike , attitudes quickly hardened . Margaret Thatcher , in a lecture in November 1984 delivered a month after she survived an assassination attempt that killed five senior Conservatives , referred to a spectrum of groups undermining rule of law : " At one end of the spectrum are the terrorist gangs within our borders , and the terrorist states which finance and arm them . At the other are the Hard Left operating inside our system , conspiring to use union power and the apparatus of local government to break , defy and subvert the law .

'' Rolling Stone '' , in a three-star review , wrote " The music is brawny and meticulous ... but '' Under Rug Swept '' just about drowns in psychobabble . While the tone of the songs , and the grain of Morissette 's voice , promise intimacy , there 's hardly a private detail anywhere . " '' Entertainment Weekly '' said " the album 's garbled title is also preparation for some of the clumsiest lyrics to be heard on a pop record in years ... The songs are riddled with such overwritten Psych 101 ruminations . " '' The Village Voice '' criticised the lyrics , saying " Much like even non-football fans used to be mesmerized by Howard Cosell 's genius for never using two words when 23 would do , you do n't have to be a love-damaged 17-year-old girl to find '' Under Rug Swept '' 's dense verbiage a trip . Words tumble forth and arrange themselves kaleidoscopically into all sorts of unusual categories ... I 'm just not sure that pop music should come out of a thesaurus . " '' NME '' called it " a tedious album " with " overwrought folk-rock like ' Surrendering ' and ' Hands Clean ' destined for a thousand organic juice bars . Lyrically , it 's often hilarious ... This record moves way beyond armchair psychology — in fact , there are armchairs that have a cannier grasp of the mind . " '' Under Rug Swept '' received a Juno Award nomination in the category of " Pop Album of the Year " . Morissette herself won the " Jack Richardson Producer of the Year " award for the songs " Hands Clean " and " So Unsexy " , and she was nominated in the " Artist of the Year " category . ( For more information , see Juno Awards of 2003 . ) '' Under Rug Swept '' entered the Canadian albums chart at number one with first week sales of 35,000 copies , and the CRIA certified it platinum the following month for shipments of 100,000 .

		CONTEXT=The Mercury Summer Theatre of the Air ( 1946 ) is a CBS radio drama series produced , directed by and starring Orson Welles . It was a short - lived summer radio series sponsored by Pabst Blue Ribbon , on Friday evenings at 10 p.m. ET lasting 15 episodes . It harked back to Welles 's earlier The Mercury Theatre on the Air ( 1938 ) and its successor , The Campbell Playhouse , but was not able to replicate its success . The series offered 30 - minute adaptations of classic plays and novels , plus some adaptations of popular motion pictures , whereas the original had offered more depth in its 60 - minute running time . Although the Mercury Theatre troupe had disbanded when Welles was fired from RKO studios in 1942 and the Mercury players were dismissed with him , this radio series offered a reunion of many Mercury personnel , including Richard Wilson ( who would direct the rehearsals ) and composer Bernard Herrmann , as well as familiar actors such as Agnes Moorehead and William Alland .

		CONTEXT=An episode of '' MTV Unplugged '' starring Cyrus premiered through MTV on January 29 , 2014 ; she performed an acoustic version of " Wrecking Ball " , among several additional tracks from '' Bangerz '' . On May 27 , 2014 Cyrus performed the song during the World Music Awards held in Monte Carlo , Monaco ; where she also won four World Music Awards . She wore a gown with a scenic theme based on flowers during the performance . It received positive reviews for its understated simplicity and strong vocal delivery . Cyrus returned to perform the song during the musical festival on June 21 , 2014 , Summertime Ball at Wembley Stadium of London , in front of 80,000 people . Cyrus has performed the song during her ongoing Bangerz Tour . A critic from the '' Nashville Scene '' praised the performance , writing , " Wrecking Ball was sung by Miley and earnestly shouted in unison by the arena , some of the audience tearing up . " Blake Hannon praised Cyrus ' vocal delivery , writing , " The crowd kept going when things slowed down for Wrecking Ball . It was the highlight of the night , and not because of anything visual . The costumed characters vanished and the screen was black , with Cyrus belting out one of the best pop power ballads in recent memory with only a smattering of lights . It 's a reminder that beneath it all , Cyrus has a voice — and a pretty big one , at that . " In September 2013 , British singer-songwriter James Arthur covered " Wrecking Ball " on Radio Hamburg in Germany . Later that month , The Gregory Brothers released a country version , which Laura Vitto from Mashable felt " trades in Miley 's pop-ballad sound for a twangier feel . " American singer-songwriter Alonzo Holt released his own rendition in October , which featured vocals from Arthur ; it peaked at number 97 on the UK Singles Chart and number 71 on the Irish Singles Chart . Upstate New York alternative metal band Cry To The Blind released a cover of " Wrecking Ball " on December 11 , 2013 .

American singer Rebecca Black uploaded an acoustic version to her YouTube channel in November . Canadian singer Sarah Blackwood of Walk Off the Earth also released an acoustic version

		CONTEXT=Reviews of '' Under Rug Swept '' on its release were generally positive . '' Billboard '' described the album as " supreme " and " very human ... it satisfies with moments of darkness , enlightenment , anger , bittersweet tension , and happiness ... Although 2002 is still young , consider '' Under Rug Swept '' one of the year 's best . " '' Q '' magazine said the album was " a smart shot across the bows ... some of the most inviting music of her career ... Morissette has fashioned a lyrical Trojan Horse to be wheeled into unsuspecting homes for months to come . " Robert Christgau wrote , " The pop-rock here lacks the faux-punk edge on '' Jagged Little Pill '' ... But Morissette instantly demonstrates her gift for the catchy ... topping memorable verse with indelible chorus , she 's a self-actualized nut who goes for what she wants , exactly as pretentious as the college girls she represents for . " According to '' LA Weekly '' , the album " is Alanis Morissette in top form , exercising her God-given right to vent and sound beautiful doing so . " Other critical appraisals were less favorable . '' Rolling Stone '' , in a three-star review , wrote " The music is brawny and meticulous ... but '' Under Rug Swept '' just about drowns in psychobabble . While the tone of the songs , and the grain of Morissette 's voice , promise intimacy , there 's hardly a private detail anywhere . " '' Entertainment Weekly '' said " the album 's garbled title is also preparation for some of the clumsiest lyrics to be heard on a pop record in years ... The songs are riddled with such overwritten Psych 101 ruminations . " '' The Village Voice '' criticised the lyrics , saying " Much like even non-football fans used to be mesmerized by Howard Cosell 's genius for never using two words when 23 would do , you do n't have to be a love-damaged 17-year-old girl to find '' Under Rug Swept '' 's dense verbiage a trip . Words tumble forth and arrange themselves kaleidoscopically into all sorts of unusual categories ... I 'm just not sure that pop music should come out of a thesaurus . " '' NME '' called it " a tedious album " with " overwrought folk-rock like ' Surrendering ' and ' Hands Clean ' destined for a thousand organic juice bars . Lyrically , it 's often hilarious ... This record moves way beyond armchair psychology — in fact , there are armchairs that have a cannier grasp of the mind . " '' Under Rug Swept '' received a Juno Award nomination in the category of " Pop Album of the Year " . Morissette herself won the " Jack Richardson Producer of the Year " award for the songs " Hands Clean " and " So Unsexy " , and she was nominated in the " Artist of the Year " category . ( For more information , see Juno Awards of 2003 . ) '' Under Rug Swept '' entered the Canadian albums chart at number one with first week sales of 35,000 copies , and the CRIA certified it platinum the following month for shipments of 100,000 . In the U.S. the album sold 215,000 copies in its first week , debuting at number one on the '' Billboard '' 200 chart during a busy sales week following the 2002 Grammy Awards ceremony ; it stayed in the top spot for a week .

		CONTEXT=Reviews of '' Under Rug Swept '' on its release were generally positive . '' Billboard '' described the album as " supreme " and " very human ... it satisfies with moments of darkness , enlightenment , anger , bittersweet tension , and happiness ... Although 2002 is still young , consider '' Under Rug Swept '' one of the year 's best . " '' Q '' magazine said the album was " a smart shot across the bows ... some of the most inviting music of her career ... Morissette has fashioned a lyrical Trojan Horse to be wheeled into unsuspecting homes for months to come . " Robert Christgau wrote , " The pop-rock here lacks the faux-punk edge on '' Jagged Little Pill '' ... But Morissette instantly demonstrates her gift for the catchy ... topping memorable verse with indelible chorus , she 's a self-actualized nut who goes for what she wants , exactly as pretentious as the college girls she represents for . " According to '' LA Weekly '' , the album " is Alanis Morissette in top form , exercising her God-given right to vent and sound beautiful doing so . " Other critical appraisals were less favorable . '' Rolling Stone '' , in a three-star review , wrote " The music is brawny and meticulous ... but '' Under Rug Swept '' just about drowns in psychobabble . While the tone of the songs , and the grain of Morissette 's voice , promise intimacy , there 's hardly a private detail anywhere . " '' Entertainment Weekly '' said " the album 's garbled title is also preparation for some of the clumsiest lyrics to be heard on a pop record in years ... The songs are riddled with such overwritten Psych 101 ruminations . " '' The Village Voice '' criticised the lyrics , saying " Much like even non-football fans used to be mesmerized by Howard Cosell 's genius for never using two words when 23 would do , you do n't have to be a love-damaged 17-year-old girl to find '' Under Rug Swept '' 's dense verbiage a trip . Words tumble forth and arrange themselves kaleidoscopically into all sorts of unusual categories ... I 'm just not sure that pop music should come out of a thesaurus . " '' NME '' called it " a tedious album " with " overwrought folk-rock like ' Surrendering ' and ' Hands Clean ' destined for a thousand organic juice bars . Lyrically , it 's often hilarious ... This record moves way beyond armchair psychology — in fact , there are armchairs that have a cannier grasp of the mind . " '' Under Rug Swept '' received a Juno Award nomination in the category of " Pop Album of the Year " . Morissette herself won the " Jack Richardson Producer of the Year " award for the songs " Hands Clean " and " So Unsexy " , and she was nominated in the " Artist of the Year " category . ( For more information , see Juno Awards of 2003 . ) '' Under Rug Swept '' entered the Canadian albums chart at number one with first week sales of 35,000 copies , and the CRIA certified it platinum the following month for shipments of 100,000 . In the U.S. the album sold 215,000 copies in its first week , debuting at number one on the '' Billboard '' 200 chart during a busy sales week following the 2002 Grammy Awards ceremony ; it stayed in the top spot for a week . Within a month of release it had sold 500,000 copies , and the RIAA certified it platinum for shipments of over one million . '' Under Rug Swept '' debuted at number one in 12 countries , including Germany , Japan and Australia . It debuted at number two in France and the United Kingdom , where the BPI certified it gold for shipping 100,000 copies

The arena , which seated 4,416 , was the home of the short - lived Jersey Larks of the Eastern Hockey League in 1960 - 61 and hosted occasional home games of the NBA Philadelphia Warriors .

		CONTEXT=Joseph ben Abraham ( Hebrew : יוסף בן אברהם הכהן , also known by the Arabic name Yusuf al - Basir ) was a Karaite philosopher and theologian who flourished in Babylonia or Persia in the first half of the eleventh century . He was the teacher of , among others , Jeshua ben Judah ( Abu al - Faraj Furkan ibn Asad ) . By way of euphemism he was surnamed " ha - Ro'eh " ( = " the seer " ) , on account of his blindness . This infirmity , however , did not prevent him from undertaking long journeys , probably as a Karaite missionary . In the course of his travels he frequented the religio - philosophical schools of the Mu ' tazili , whose teachings he defended in his works . Of these the most important is the Muhtawi , translated from the Arabic into Hebrew , perhaps by Tobiah ben Moses , under the title Sefer ha - Ne'imot , or Zikron ha - Datot . It is divided into forty chapters , in which all the main principles of the Mu ' tazili kalam are applied to the Karaite dogmas : the five principles of the unity of God ; the necessity of admitting atoms and accidents ; the existence of a Creator ; the necessity of admitting certain attributes and rejecting others ; God 's justice and its relation to free will ; reward and punishment ; etc. . The author often argues against the Christians , the Dualists , the Magians , the Epicureans , and various other sects , with whose tenets he shows himself well acquainted . He cites the founders of the Mu ' tazili sects of al - Jabaiyah and al - Bahshamiyyah , Abu Ali Muhammad ibn Abd al - Wahhab al - Jabai , and his son Hashim Abd al - Salam , whose teachings he closely follows . The Muhtawi is still extant in manuscript , both in the Arabic original and in its Hebrew translation ; the former in the David Kaufmann Library , the latter in the libraries of Leiden , Paris , and St. Petersburg .

In his second biennial message to the state legislature , he discussed how buildings were being constructed without consideration for their outward appearance . He stated that it was time for buildings to become more aesthetically pleasing in addition to being functional , and he suggested the " Tudor - Gothic style " as the most inexpensive way to do this . Consequently , several of the state universities in Illinois erected buildings which resembled castles in his honor .

		CONTEXT='' Arrival and Departure '' ( 1943 ) is the third novel of Arthur Koestler 's trilogy concerning the conflict between morality and expedience ( as described in the postscript to the novel 's 1966 Danube Edition ) . The first volume , '' The Gladiators '' , is about the subversion of the Spartacus revolt , and the second , '' Darkness at Noon '' , is the celebrated novel about the Soviet Show trials . '' Arrival and Departure '' was Koestler 's first full-length work in English , '' The Gladiators '' and '' Darkness at Noon '' were originally written in German . It is often considered to be the weakest of the three . Reviewing the novel in December 1943 George Orwell called it notable " for what must be one of the most shocking descriptions of Nazi terrorism that have ever been written . " Written during the middle of World War II , '' Arrival and Departure '' reflects Koestler 's own plight as a Hungarian refugee . Like Koestler , the main character is a former member of the Communist party . He escapes to ' Neutralia ' , a neutral country based on Portugal , where Koestler himself had gone , and flees from there . ( Stephen Spender had supposedly said of Neutralia , " Names like that should not be allowed in novels ! " ) Reflecting Koestler 's later life relationship with science , and particularly his disagreement with various movements within psychiatry , the main character emerges from treatment psychically neutered , and the critical question of the novel is how much of his later trauma and political activity is due to a small incident in his childhood

		CONTEXT=Eulalie Piccard ( Saint Petersburg , 26 October 1879 - Neuchâtel , June 1957 ) , sometimes called Eulalie Piccard Guée , was a Russian - Swiss novelist , translator and teacher , writing in French . She was one of the first literary writers to explore the transformation of Russia into the Soviet Union and the police state that was constructed there under Joseph Stalin . While her work does not approach the literary force of Alexander Solzhenitsyn or Varlam Shalamov and did n't reach major public attention , it represented an early sustained effort to expose legal and penal developments in the Soviet Union that , in the 1930s and 1940s , were little discussed outside Russian emigrant circles . When show trials and labour camps were referred to in newspapers and books at the time , the tone was generally sensational and made little attempt to connect them to Soviet political culture or to everyday life .

		CONTEXT=East of Elephant Rock is a 1977 British independent drama film directed by Don Boyd and starring John Hurt , Jeremy Kemp and Judi Bowker . It was Boyd 's second feature film following his little - noticed 1975 Intimate Reflections . Like William Somerset Maugham 's 1927 play The Letter and two subsequent film adaptations , its narrative content depended on the 1911 Ethel Proudlock murder in Kuala Lumpur , Malaysia , which became a cause célèbre scandalising British colonial society and which had been featured in a Sunday Observer article as recently as the year before . Boyd , drawing in part on his own experience of growing up in an increasingly dysfunctional family in Kenya during the Mau Mau rebellion , wanted to tell a story about the decline of the Empire and the surrender of responsibility . In the event his project was for the most part ridiculed but the film did draw warm support from the film director Bryan Forbes .

'' Billboard '' described the album as " supreme " and " very human ... it satisfies with moments of darkness , enlightenment , anger , bittersweet tension , and happiness ... Although 2002 is still young , consider '' Under Rug Swept '' one of the year 's best . " '' Q '' magazine said the album was " a smart shot across the bows ... some of the most inviting music of her career ... Morissette has fashioned a lyrical Trojan Horse to be wheeled into unsuspecting homes for months to come . " Robert Christgau wrote , " The pop-rock here lacks the faux-punk edge on '' Jagged Little Pill '' ... But Morissette instantly demonstrates her gift for the catchy ... topping memorable verse with indelible chorus , she 's a self-actualized nut who goes for what she wants , exactly as pretentious as the college girls she represents for . " According to '' LA Weekly '' , the album " is Alanis Morissette in top form , exercising her God-given right to vent and sound beautiful doing so . " Other critical appraisals were less favorable . '' Rolling Stone '' , in a three-star review , wrote " The music is brawny and meticulous ... but '' Under Rug Swept '' just about drowns in psychobabble . While the tone of the songs , and the grain of Morissette 's voice , promise intimacy , there 's hardly a private detail anywhere . " '' Entertainment Weekly '' said " the album 's garbled title is also preparation for some of the clumsiest lyrics to be heard on a pop record in years ... The songs are riddled with such overwritten Psych 101 ruminations . " '' The Village Voice '' criticised the lyrics , saying " Much like even non-football fans used to be mesmerized by Howard Cosell 's genius for never using two words when 23 would do , you do n't have to be a love-damaged 17-year-old girl to find '' Under Rug Swept '' 's dense verbiage a trip . Words tumble forth and arrange themselves kaleidoscopically into all sorts of unusual categories ... I 'm just not sure that pop music should come out of a thesaurus . " '' NME '' called it " a tedious album " with " overwrought folk-rock like ' Surrendering ' and ' Hands Clean ' destined for a thousand organic juice bars . Lyrically , it 's often hilarious ... This record moves way beyond armchair psychology — in fact , there are armchairs that have a cannier grasp of the mind . " '' Under Rug Swept '' received a Juno Award nomination in the category of " Pop Album of the Year " . Morissette herself won the " Jack Richardson Producer of the Year " award for the songs " Hands Clean " and " So Unsexy " , and she was nominated in the " Artist of the Year " category . ( For more information , see Juno Awards of 2003 . ) '' Under Rug Swept '' entered the Canadian albums chart at number one with first week sales of 35,000 copies , and the CRIA certified it platinum the following month for shipments of 100,000 . In the U.S. the album sold 215,000 copies in its first week , debuting at number one on the '' Billboard '' 200 chart during a busy sales week following the 2002 Grammy Awards ceremony ; it stayed in the top spot for a week .

" Blake Hannon praised Cyrus ' vocal delivery , writing , " The crowd kept going when things slowed down for Wrecking Ball . It was the highlight of the night , and not because of anything visual . The costumed characters vanished and the screen was black , with Cyrus belting out one of the best pop power ballads in recent memory with only a smattering of lights . It 's a reminder that beneath it all , Cyrus has a voice — and a pretty big one , at that . " In September 2013 , British singer-songwriter James Arthur covered " Wrecking Ball " on Radio Hamburg in Germany . Later that month , The Gregory Brothers released a country version , which Laura Vitto from Mashable felt " trades in Miley 's pop-ballad sound for a twangier feel .

		CONTEXT=President François Tombalbaye faced a task of considerable magnitude when Chad became a sovereign state in 1960 . His challenge was to build a nation out of a vast and diverse territory that had poor communications , few known resources , a tiny market , and a collection of impoverished people with sharply differing political traditions , ethnic and regional loyalties , and sociocultural patterns . The French colonial powers that had created the country 's boundaries had done little to promote economic interdependence , political cooperation , or crosscultural understanding . Chadians who had hoped that the country 's first president might turn out to be a state builder like the 13th century 's Dabbalemi or the 16th century 's Aluma were soon disappointed . During its first fifteen years , Chad under Tombalbaye experienced worsening economic conditions , eventual alienation of the most patient of foreign allies , exacerbation of ethnic and regional conflict , and grave weakening of the state as an instrument of governance .

In 1992 , the scope of the awards was expanded to honor animation as a whole ; the Annie Award for Best Animated Feature was created as a result of this move , and subsequent awards have been created to recognize different contributions to animation . The Annie Award for Best Animated Video Game was created in 2005 , and has been awarded yearly since except in 2009 . To be eligible for the award , the game must have been released in the year before the next Annie Awards ceremony , and the developers of the game must send a five - minute DVD that shows the gameplay and graphics of the game to a committee appointed by the Board of Directors of ASIFA - Hollywood .

		CONTEXT='' Arrival and Departure '' ( 1943 ) is the third novel of Arthur Koestler 's trilogy concerning the conflict between morality and expedience ( as described in the postscript to the novel 's 1966 Danube Edition ) . The first volume , '' The Gladiators '' , is about the subversion of the Spartacus revolt , and the second , '' Darkness at Noon '' , is the celebrated novel about the Soviet Show trials . '' Arrival and Departure '' was Koestler 's first full-length work in English , '' The Gladiators '' and '' Darkness at Noon '' were originally written in German . It is often considered to be the weakest of the three . Reviewing the novel in December 1943 George Orwell called it notable " for what must be one of the most shocking descriptions of Nazi terrorism that have ever been written . " Written during the middle of World War II , '' Arrival and Departure '' reflects Koestler 's own plight as a Hungarian refugee . Like Koestler , the main character is a former member of the Communist party . He escapes to ' Neutralia ' , a neutral country based on Portugal , where Koestler himself had gone , and flees from there . ( Stephen Spender had supposedly said of Neutralia , " Names like that should not be allowed in novels ! " ) Reflecting Koestler 's later life relationship with science , and particularly his disagreement with various movements within psychiatry , the main character emerges from treatment psychically neutered , and the critical question of the novel is how much of his later trauma and political activity is due to a small incident in his childhood

		CONTEXT='' Stranger Things 3 '' has received positive reviews from critics . On Rotten Tomatoes , the third season received an approval rating of 90 % based on 116 reviews , and an average rating of 7.94 / 10 . The site 's critical consensus states , " Vibrant and charming , '' Stranger Things '' transforms itself into a riveting — if familiar — summer ride that basks in its neon-laden nostalgia without losing sight of the rich relationships that make the series so endearing . " On Metacritic , the third season has a weighted average score of 72 out of 100 , based on 24 critics , indicating " generally favorable reviews . " Writing in the '' New Statesman '' , Emily Bootle considered the third season an improvement on the second : " ... after a confused and rambling season two , the third season of Stranger Things is a return to strength – where season two had something of an identity crisis , season three has largely brought back what made the show unique in the first place . " Hugh Montgomery at ''BBC.com '' awarded 5 stars , describing the third season as " an exhilarating example of a franchise hitting new heights that Hollywood would do well to learn from . " On the dissenting side , Darren Franich of '' Entertainment Weekly '' criticized the third season for looking like a Reagan-era pop culture mixtape . Ed Power of '' The Telegraph '' blamed Duffer Brothers for refusing " to stray from the Goonies-meets-Stephen King formula " and recycling their " well-worn bag of retro references to increasingly underwhelming effect " , producing the limpest installment of the three . His opinion was echoed by Hank Stuever of '' The Washington Post '' , who felt almost heartbroken for " the Duffers working so hard to re-create an elusive vibe " of 1980s with a " mishmash of ingredients : John Carpenter , Steven Spielberg , Stephen King , Freddy Krueger , Rambo , the Terminator , the aliens of LV-426 " only to fail to create a fully entertaining show . Writing in '' National Review '' , Daniel Payne criticized the season 's " sloppy storytelling " and " cornball humor " compared to the previous seasons , claiming that season three was " frenetic and bewildering where the first two seasons were slow , careful , and rewarding in crafting their plots . " As part of the 2019 Teen Choice Awards '' Stranger Things '' received a nomination for Choice Summer TV show . Caleb McLaughlin , Finn Wolfhard , Gaten Matarazzo , and Noah Schnapp were all nominated for Choice Summer TV actor for their work on the series while Millie Bobby Brown was nominated for Choice Summer TV actress for her work on the series .

		CONTEXT=Reviews of '' Under Rug Swept '' on its release were generally positive . '' Billboard '' described the album as " supreme " and " very human ... it satisfies with moments of darkness , enlightenment , anger , bittersweet tension , and happiness ... Although 2002 is still young , consider '' Under Rug Swept '' one of the year 's best . " '' Q '' magazine said the album was " a smart shot across the bows ... some of the most inviting music of her career ... Morissette has fashioned a lyrical Trojan Horse to be wheeled into unsuspecting homes for months to come . " Robert Christgau wrote , " The pop-rock here lacks the faux-punk edge on '' Jagged Little Pill '' ... But Morissette instantly demonstrates her gift for the catchy ... topping memorable verse with indelible chorus , she 's a self-actualized nut who goes for what she wants , exactly as pretentious as the college girls she represents for . " According to '' LA Weekly '' , the album " is Alanis Morissette in top form , exercising her God-given right to vent and sound beautiful doing so . " Other critical appraisals were less favorable . '' Rolling Stone '' , in a three-star review , wrote " The music is brawny and meticulous ... but '' Under Rug Swept '' just about drowns in psychobabble . While the tone of the songs , and the grain of Morissette 's voice , promise intimacy , there 's hardly a private detail anywhere . " '' Entertainment Weekly '' said " the album 's garbled title is also preparation for some of the clumsiest lyrics to be heard on a pop record in years ... The songs are riddled with such overwritten Psych 101 ruminations . " '' The Village Voice '' criticised the lyrics , saying " Much like even non-football fans used to be mesmerized by Howard Cosell 's genius for never using two words when 23 would do , you do n't have to be a love-damaged 17-year-old girl to find '' Under Rug Swept '' 's dense verbiage a trip . Words tumble forth and arrange themselves kaleidoscopically into all sorts of unusual categories ... I 'm just not sure that pop music should come out of a thesaurus . " '' NME '' called it " a tedious album " with " overwrought folk-rock like ' Surrendering ' and ' Hands Clean ' destined for a thousand organic juice bars . Lyrically , it 's often hilarious ... This record moves way beyond armchair psychology — in fact , there are armchairs that have a cannier grasp of the mind . " '' Under Rug Swept '' received a Juno Award nomination in the category of " Pop Album of the Year " . Morissette herself won the " Jack Richardson Producer of the Year " award for the songs " Hands Clean " and " So Unsexy " , and she was nominated in the " Artist of the Year " category . ( For more information , see Juno Awards of 2003 . ) '' Under Rug Swept '' entered the Canadian albums chart at number one with first week sales of 35,000 copies , and the CRIA certified it platinum the following month for shipments of 100,000 . In the U.S. the album sold 215,000 copies in its first week , debuting at number one on the '' Billboard '' 200 chart during a busy sales week following the 2002 Grammy Awards ceremony ; it stayed in the top spot for a week . Within a month of release it had sold 500,000 copies , and the RIAA certified it platinum for shipments of over one million . '' Under Rug Swept '' debuted at number one in 12 countries , including Germany , Japan and Australia .

Based on a short story by Stephen Vincent Benét , the film 's music is by Saul Chaplin and Gene de Paul , with lyrics by Johnny Mercer and choreography by Michael Kidd . Jane Powell plays Milly , an 1850s frontierswoman who marries Adam ( Howard Keel ) only hours after meeting him . When she returns with Adam to his log cabin in the Oregon backwoods , Milly discovers that her husband 's six brothers are uncivilized and oafish . She makes it her mission to domesticate them and , upon Milly 's sarcastic suggestion , the brothers kidnap six women from a neighboring town to marry them . The film was shot in the new CinemaScope format and is remembered for its dance sequences , particularly the " barn raising scene " in which architecture and construction become acrobatic ballet steps . '' Seven Brides for Seven Brothers '' was one of the highest-grossing films of 1954 and appeared on many critics ' 10 Best Films lists .

" Ebert continued , " It tells its story soberly and intelligently , and with quiet style ... It 's the kind of movie that sends you away from the screen filled with curiosity to know more about this man Burton . " In '' Newsweek '' , critic Jack Kroll wrote , " The exploits of Sir Richard Francis Burton make Lawrence of Arabia look like a tourist . . . . From scene to scene this film grips you as few movies do , moving between Africa and England to spotlight an extraordinary range of characters in both ' primitive ' and ' civilized ' cultures : from the African tribal chiefs , mild or murderous , to the nabobs of the Royal Geographical Society , honest or treacherous . " Rafelson later observed , " I was very lucky to make that movie . And I can tell you , if there was ever a movie that I enjoyed making , it was that one . " In 1992 Rafelson teamed up with Nicholson and '' Five Easy Pieces '' screenwriter Carole Eastman for the film '' Man Trouble '' . In 1996 he made his last film with Nicholson to date , '' Blood and Wine '' .

After having a promising start in his first season at Fitzroy , he sought clearance to be transferred to Carlton . The move was said to be motivated by financial gain , however Marchesani has since denied this claim . In his first season , he failed to live up to expectation – this was only compounded by the fact that his move to Carlton included the popular Peter Francis being traded in return . Marchenasi planned to retire after the 1985 season due to injury problems , however he was enticed by Essendon to continue playing the following season . This new chance was to prove unsuccessful , with another injury ending his career before he was able to play a single senior game at Essendon .

On May 27 , 2014 Cyrus performed the song during the World Music Awards held in Monte Carlo , Monaco ; where she also won four World Music Awards . She wore a gown with a scenic theme based on flowers during the performance . It received positive reviews for its understated simplicity and strong vocal delivery . Cyrus returned to perform the song during the musical festival on June 21 , 2014 , Summertime Ball at Wembley Stadium of London , in front of 80,000 people . Cyrus has performed the song during her ongoing Bangerz Tour . A critic from the '' Nashville Scene '' praised the performance , writing , " Wrecking Ball was sung by Miley and earnestly shouted in unison by the arena , some of the audience tearing up . " Blake Hannon praised Cyrus ' vocal delivery , writing , " The crowd kept going when things slowed down for Wrecking Ball . It was the highlight of the night , and not because of anything visual . The costumed characters vanished and the screen was black , with Cyrus belting out one of the best pop power ballads in recent memory with only a smattering of lights . It 's a reminder that beneath it all , Cyrus has a voice — and a pretty big one , at that . " In September 2013 , British singer-songwriter James Arthur covered " Wrecking Ball " on Radio Hamburg in Germany . Later that month , The Gregory Brothers released a country version , which Laura Vitto from Mashable felt " trades in Miley 's pop-ballad sound for a twangier feel .

'' Billboard '' described the album as " supreme " and " very human ... it satisfies with moments of darkness , enlightenment , anger , bittersweet tension , and happiness ... Although 2002 is still young , consider '' Under Rug Swept '' one of the year 's best . " '' Q '' magazine said the album was " a smart shot across the bows ... some of the most inviting music of her career ... Morissette has fashioned a lyrical Trojan Horse to be wheeled into unsuspecting homes for months to come . " Robert Christgau wrote , " The pop-rock here lacks the faux-punk edge on '' Jagged Little Pill '' ... But Morissette instantly demonstrates her gift for the catchy ... topping memorable verse with indelible chorus , she 's a self-actualized nut who goes for what she wants , exactly as pretentious as the college girls she represents for . " According to '' LA Weekly '' , the album " is Alanis Morissette in top form , exercising her God-given right to vent and sound beautiful doing so . " Other critical appraisals were less favorable . '' Rolling Stone '' , in a three-star review , wrote " The music is brawny and meticulous ... but '' Under Rug Swept '' just about drowns in psychobabble . While the tone of the songs , and the grain of Morissette 's voice , promise intimacy , there 's hardly a private detail anywhere . " '' Entertainment Weekly '' said " the album 's garbled title is also preparation for some of the clumsiest lyrics to be heard on a pop record in years ... The songs are riddled with such overwritten Psych 101 ruminations . " '' The Village Voice '' criticised the lyrics , saying " Much like even non-football fans used to be mesmerized by Howard Cosell 's genius for never using two words when 23 would do , you do n't have to be a love-damaged 17-year-old girl to find '' Under Rug Swept '' 's dense verbiage a trip . Words tumble forth and arrange themselves kaleidoscopically into all sorts of unusual categories ... I 'm just not sure that pop music should come out of a thesaurus . " '' NME '' called it " a tedious album " with " overwrought folk-rock like ' Surrendering ' and ' Hands Clean ' destined for a thousand organic juice bars . Lyrically , it 's often hilarious ... This record moves way beyond armchair psychology — in fact , there are armchairs that have a cannier grasp of the mind . " '' Under Rug Swept '' received a Juno Award nomination in the category of " Pop Album of the Year " . Morissette herself won the " Jack Richardson Producer of the Year " award for the songs " Hands Clean " and " So Unsexy " , and she was nominated in the " Artist of the Year " category . ( For more information , see Juno Awards of 2003 . ) '' Under Rug Swept '' entered the Canadian albums chart at number one with first week sales of 35,000 copies , and the CRIA certified it platinum the following month for shipments of 100,000 .

In an effort to reinforce and resupply the colony , the French government sent four vessels to the West Indies in November 1809 under Commodore François Roquebert . Two of the ships were 20 - gun flûtes carrying supplies and troops . The two others were 40 - gun frigates , ordered to protect the storeships on their journey from the British forces operating off both the French and Guadeloupe coasts .

One of the most prolific and popular Australian artists of his generation , Lindsay attracted both acclaim and controversy for his works , many of which infused the Australian landscape with erotic pagan elements and were deemed by his critics to be " anti-Christian , anti-social and degenerate " . A vocal nationalist , he became a regular artist for The Bulletin at the height of its cultural influence , and advanced staunchly anti- modernist views as a leading writer on Australian art . When friend and literary critic Bertram Stevens argued that children like to read about fairies rather than food , Lindsay wrote and illustrated The Magic Pudding ( 1918 ) , now considered a classic work of Australian children 's literature .

		CONTEXT=Ouida ( ; 1 January 1839 – 25 January 1908 ) was the pseudonym of the English novelist Maria Louise Ramé ( although she preferred to be known as Marie Louise de la Ramée ) . During her career , Ouida wrote more than 40 novels , as well as short stories , children 's books and essays . Moderately successful , she lived a life of luxury , entertaining many of the literary figures of the day . Under Two Flags , one of her most famous novels , described the British in Algeria . It expressed sympathy for the French colonists — with whom Ouida deeply identified — and , to some extent , the Arabs . The novel was adapted for the stage , and was filmed six times . Her novel A Dog of Flanders is considered a children 's classic in much of Asia . The American author Jack London cited her novel Signa , as one of the reasons for his literary success . Her lavish lifestyle eventually led her to penury , and her works were put up for auction to pay her debts . She died in Italy from pneumonia . Soon after her death , her friends organized a public subscription in Bury St Edmunds , where they had a fountain for horses and dogs installed in her name .

" Television critic Frazier Moore commented that Rock 's performance was a " needed pick-me-up , presiding over the broadcast with saucy finesse . " He added , " In sum , the broadcast felt brisk , though not rushed . It felt modern and refreshingly free of chronic self-importance . " Brian Lowry of '' Variety '' gave an average review of Rock but remarked , " For all the hand-wringing about the awards descending into the muck , the 77th Academy Awards proved a classy affair , with precious little red meat to satiate Hollywood bashers . " The American telecast on ABC drew an average of 42.14 million people over its length , which was a 3 % decrease from the previous year 's ceremony . The show also drew lower Nielsen ratings compared to the two previous ceremonies with 25.4 of households watching over a 38 share .

		CONTEXT=In 1990 Rafelson directed '' Mountains of the Moon '' , a film about the 1857 – 58 journey of Richard Francis Burton and John Hanning Speke in their expedition to central Africa — the project that culminated in Speke 's discovery of the source of the Nile River . It starred Patrick Bergin as Burton and Iain Glen as Speke , and was hailed by critic Roger Ebert as " completely absorbing . " Ebert continued , " It tells its story soberly and intelligently , and with quiet style ... It 's the kind of movie that sends you away from the screen filled with curiosity to know more about this man Burton . " In '' Newsweek '' , critic Jack Kroll wrote , " The exploits of Sir Richard Francis Burton make Lawrence of Arabia look like a tourist . . . . From scene to scene this film grips you as few movies do , moving between Africa and England to spotlight an extraordinary range of characters in both ' primitive ' and ' civilized ' cultures : from the African tribal chiefs , mild or murderous , to the nabobs of the Royal Geographical Society , honest or treacherous . " Rafelson later observed , " I was very lucky to make that movie . And I can tell you , if there was ever a movie that I enjoyed making , it was that one . " In 1992 Rafelson teamed up with Nicholson and '' Five Easy Pieces '' screenwriter Carole Eastman for the film '' Man Trouble '' . In 1996 he made his last film with Nicholson to date , '' Blood and Wine '' . His most recent films are 1998 's '' Poodle Springs '' and 2002 's '' No Good Deed '' , based on works by Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett , respectively . '' No Good Deed '' was entered into the 24th Moscow International Film Festival

" On Metacritic , the third season has a weighted average score of 72 out of 100 , based on 24 critics , indicating " generally favorable reviews . " Writing in the '' New Statesman '' , Emily Bootle considered the third season an improvement on the second : " ... after a confused and rambling season two , the third season of Stranger Things is a return to strength – where season two had something of an identity crisis , season three has largely brought back what made the show unique in the first place . " Hugh Montgomery at ''BBC.com '' awarded 5 stars , describing the third season as " an exhilarating example of a franchise hitting new heights that Hollywood would do well to learn from . " On the dissenting side , Darren Franich of '' Entertainment Weekly '' criticized the third season for looking like a Reagan-era pop culture mixtape . Ed Power of '' The Telegraph '' blamed Duffer Brothers for refusing " to stray from the Goonies-meets-Stephen King formula " and recycling their " well-worn bag of retro references to increasingly underwhelming effect " , producing the limpest installment of the three .

Their début album Usurper of the Sun Rays was self - released on an MC - cassette in 1993 . It presented a very particular brew that incorporated elements of heavy and at the same time psychedelic music based on sound experimentation . It was hypnotic , heavy and sophisticated . In 1994 , the group might have split , but two musicians of a respected mainstream heavy - metal outfit — Soma — made the band live on . Same year the MDP recorded at Asparez studio their first prog - suite — the River — which today is mentioned in all anthologies of Armenian rock . Next few years the band spent in Russia and released their another album , Take Your Nibbled Apple Back , which boasted eerie vocal experimentations with female vocals . In 2002 , the MDP recorded a very unexpected single , " Falling in Love / Should I " , which incorporated trip - hop elements , but this was short - lived , since the reviews in British and American press would stress that they are particularly great at playing heavier stuff than Portishead / Sylvian moods . Upon opening its own studio , in 2003 and 2004 , MDP produced a range of events themselves : festivals MindPower , concerts and gigs for other popular Armenian rock - bands . They again play very heavy music , close to sympho - rock , though it is always difficult to describe their music . Recent reviews from OverHook Music tell that they have stylistic resemblance with Dream Theatre , while others recommend to remember Mars Volta . They deservedly attracted attention of German independent promoters and concerted in Dresden in 2005 . Now the band also stands as producer of numerous rock - concerts and rock - festivals in Armenia . Vibrographus Studio , headed by band members , boasts the best hardware in Yerevan for production of rock events . One of the band 's 2008 offspring is the Dogma project , which features female vocals augmented with the band 's bass and guitar .

		CONTEXT=The dangers to journalists in Russia have been well known since the early 1990s but concern over the number of unsolved killings soared after Anna Politkovskaya 's murder in Moscow on 7 October 2006 . While international monitors mentioned a dozen deaths , some sources within Russia talked of over two hundred fatalities . The evidence has since been examined and documented in two reports , published in Russian and English , by international organizations . These revealed a basic confusion in terminology that explained the seemingly enormous numerical discrepancy : statistics of premature death among journalists ( from work accidents , crossfire incidents , and purely criminal or domestic cases of manslaughter ) were repeatedly equated with the much smaller number of targeted ( contract ) killings or work - related murders . The Remembrance Day of Journalists Killed in the Line of Duty in Russia is observed on 15 December every year .

In 1994 , the group might have split , but two musicians of a respected mainstream heavy - metal outfit — Soma — made the band live on . Same year the MDP recorded at Asparez studio their first prog - suite — the River — which today is mentioned in all anthologies of Armenian rock . Next few years the band spent in Russia and released their another album , Take Your Nibbled Apple Back , which boasted eerie vocal experimentations with female vocals . In 2002 , the MDP recorded a very unexpected single , " Falling in Love / Should I " , which incorporated trip - hop elements , but this was short - lived , since the reviews in British and American press would stress that they are particularly great at playing heavier stuff than Portishead / Sylvian moods . Upon opening its own studio , in 2003 and 2004 , MDP produced a range of events themselves : festivals MindPower , concerts and gigs for other popular Armenian rock - bands . They again play very heavy music , close to sympho - rock , though it is always difficult to describe their music . Recent reviews from OverHook Music tell that they have stylistic resemblance with Dream Theatre , while others recommend to remember Mars Volta . They deservedly attracted attention of German independent promoters and concerted in Dresden in 2005 . Now the band also stands as producer of numerous rock - concerts and rock - festivals in Armenia . Vibrographus Studio , headed by band members , boasts the best hardware in Yerevan for production of rock events . One of the band 's 2008 offspring is the Dogma project , which features female vocals augmented with the band 's bass and guitar .

		CONTEXT='' Arrival and Departure '' ( 1943 ) is the third novel of Arthur Koestler 's trilogy concerning the conflict between morality and expedience ( as described in the postscript to the novel 's 1966 Danube Edition ) . The first volume , '' The Gladiators '' , is about the subversion of the Spartacus revolt , and the second , '' Darkness at Noon '' , is the celebrated novel about the Soviet Show trials . '' Arrival and Departure '' was Koestler 's first full-length work in English , '' The Gladiators '' and '' Darkness at Noon '' were originally written in German . It is often considered to be the weakest of the three . Reviewing the novel in December 1943 George Orwell called it notable " for what must be one of the most shocking descriptions of Nazi terrorism that have ever been written . " Written during the middle of World War II , '' Arrival and Departure '' reflects Koestler 's own plight as a Hungarian refugee . Like Koestler , the main character is a former member of the Communist party . He escapes to ' Neutralia ' , a neutral country based on Portugal , where Koestler himself had gone , and flees from there . ( Stephen Spender had supposedly said of Neutralia , " Names like that should not be allowed in novels ! " ) Reflecting Koestler 's later life relationship with science , and particularly his disagreement with various movements within psychiatry , the main character emerges from treatment psychically neutered , and the critical question of the novel is how much of his later trauma and political activity is due to a small incident in his childhood

		CONTEXT=Reviews of '' Under Rug Swept '' on its release were generally positive . '' Billboard '' described the album as " supreme " and " very human ... it satisfies with moments of darkness , enlightenment , anger , bittersweet tension , and happiness ... Although 2002 is still young , consider '' Under Rug Swept '' one of the year 's best . " '' Q '' magazine said the album was " a smart shot across the bows ... some of the most inviting music of her career ... Morissette has fashioned a lyrical Trojan Horse to be wheeled into unsuspecting homes for months to come . " Robert Christgau wrote , " The pop-rock here lacks the faux-punk edge on '' Jagged Little Pill '' ... But Morissette instantly demonstrates her gift for the catchy ... topping memorable verse with indelible chorus , she 's a self-actualized nut who goes for what she wants , exactly as pretentious as the college girls she represents for . " According to '' LA Weekly '' , the album " is Alanis Morissette in top form , exercising her God-given right to vent and sound beautiful doing so . " Other critical appraisals were less favorable . '' Rolling Stone '' , in a three-star review , wrote " The music is brawny and meticulous ... but '' Under Rug Swept '' just about drowns in psychobabble . While the tone of the songs , and the grain of Morissette 's voice , promise intimacy , there 's hardly a private detail anywhere . " '' Entertainment Weekly '' said " the album 's garbled title is also preparation for some of the clumsiest lyrics to be heard on a pop record in years ... The songs are riddled with such overwritten Psych 101 ruminations . " '' The Village Voice '' criticised the lyrics , saying " Much like even non-football fans used to be mesmerized by Howard Cosell 's genius for never using two words when 23 would do , you do n't have to be a love-damaged 17-year-old girl to find '' Under Rug Swept '' 's dense verbiage a trip . Words tumble forth and arrange themselves kaleidoscopically into all sorts of unusual categories ... I 'm just not sure that pop music should come out of a thesaurus . " '' NME '' called it " a tedious album " with " overwrought folk-rock like ' Surrendering ' and ' Hands Clean ' destined for a thousand organic juice bars . Lyrically , it 's often hilarious ... This record moves way beyond armchair psychology — in fact , there are armchairs that have a cannier grasp of the mind . " '' Under Rug Swept '' received a Juno Award nomination in the category of " Pop Album of the Year " . Morissette herself won the " Jack Richardson Producer of the Year " award for the songs " Hands Clean " and " So Unsexy " , and she was nominated in the " Artist of the Year " category . ( For more information , see Juno Awards of 2003 . ) '' Under Rug Swept '' entered the Canadian albums chart at number one with first week sales of 35,000 copies , and the CRIA certified it platinum the following month for shipments of 100,000 . In the U.S. the album sold 215,000 copies in its first week , debuting at number one on the '' Billboard '' 200 chart during a busy sales week following the 2002 Grammy Awards ceremony ; it stayed in the top spot for a week .

		CONTEXT=Reviews of '' Under Rug Swept '' on its release were generally positive . '' Billboard '' described the album as " supreme " and " very human ... it satisfies with moments of darkness , enlightenment , anger , bittersweet tension , and happiness ... Although 2002 is still young , consider '' Under Rug Swept '' one of the year 's best . " '' Q '' magazine said the album was " a smart shot across the bows ... some of the most inviting music of her career ... Morissette has fashioned a lyrical Trojan Horse to be wheeled into unsuspecting homes for months to come . " Robert Christgau wrote , " The pop-rock here lacks the faux-punk edge on '' Jagged Little Pill '' ... But Morissette instantly demonstrates her gift for the catchy ... topping memorable verse with indelible chorus , she 's a self-actualized nut who goes for what she wants , exactly as pretentious as the college girls she represents for . " According to '' LA Weekly '' , the album " is Alanis Morissette in top form , exercising her God-given right to vent and sound beautiful doing so . " Other critical appraisals were less favorable . '' Rolling Stone '' , in a three-star review , wrote " The music is brawny and meticulous ... but '' Under Rug Swept '' just about drowns in psychobabble . While the tone of the songs , and the grain of Morissette 's voice , promise intimacy , there 's hardly a private detail anywhere . " '' Entertainment Weekly '' said " the album 's garbled title is also preparation for some of the clumsiest lyrics to be heard on a pop record in years ... The songs are riddled with such overwritten Psych 101 ruminations . " '' The Village Voice '' criticised the lyrics , saying " Much like even non-football fans used to be mesmerized by Howard Cosell 's genius for never using two words when 23 would do , you do n't have to be a love-damaged 17-year-old girl to find '' Under Rug Swept '' 's dense verbiage a trip . Words tumble forth and arrange themselves kaleidoscopically into all sorts of unusual categories ... I 'm just not sure that pop music should come out of a thesaurus . " '' NME '' called it " a tedious album " with " overwrought folk-rock like ' Surrendering ' and ' Hands Clean ' destined for a thousand organic juice bars . Lyrically , it 's often hilarious ... This record moves way beyond armchair psychology — in fact , there are armchairs that have a cannier grasp of the mind . " '' Under Rug Swept '' received a Juno Award nomination in the category of " Pop Album of the Year " . Morissette herself won the " Jack Richardson Producer of the Year " award for the songs " Hands Clean " and " So Unsexy " , and she was nominated in the " Artist of the Year " category . ( For more information , see Juno Awards of 2003 . ) '' Under Rug Swept '' entered the Canadian albums chart at number one with first week sales of 35,000 copies , and the CRIA certified it platinum the following month for shipments of 100,000 .

		CONTEXT=Music critics favorably reviewed " Never Catch Me " . Named Best New Track by '' Pitchfork Media '' , editor Jayson Greene praised Lamar 's performance , writing " his hyper-vaulting flow and embedded rhyme patterns within rhyme patterns " . For its year-end list of " The 100 Best Tracks of 2014 " , '' Pitchfork '' ranked the song at number 23 . Also commenting on Lamar , '' Billboard '' 's Chris Payne wrote , " There are n't many A-list rappers who could handle a beat like this , but Kendrick is clearly one of them . " '' Rolling Stone '' editor Jon Dolan gave the song three-and-a-half out of five stars , commenting " Over offhandedly lovely , warp-speed psychedelic soul-jazz , Lamar unleashes a word-mad waterfall with a worried emotional core ( " analyze my demise I say I 'm super-anxious " , he raps ) . " '' Consequence of Sound '' editor Nina Corcoran wrote : " when combined with one of Lamar ’s hottest verses to date ( before '' To Pimp a Butterfly '' ) , the song explodes . But it does n’t stop there . FlyLo shows off his talent by shifting gears post-Kendrick verse the only way you can : insane keys , double-time bass drum , and unrelenting hand claps . Eventually , it ’s all swallowed up in massive swelling synth and choral hums , fading to a beautiful , passionate outro . " Directed by Hiro Murai , the video begins at a funeral ( including attendees Flying Lotus and Thundercat in cameo roles ) . Seemingly a sad video , it turns instantly joyful when the two late children - a boy and a girl - bound out of their caskets at the front of the church and dance gleefully down the aisle . The mourners ca n't see the children as they dance right out of the church and out onto a blacktop , but a group of other kids chases after them as they hop in a hearse and drive away . The clip was featured by several publications on their year-end list of best videos , including '' Pitchfork '' , '' Spin '' , and Stereogumwith the latter listing it at number one . The video received two nominations at the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards : Best Choreography and Best Cinematography , ultimately winning the latter

In other late contributions , Caragiale pioneered detective fiction locally , but there is disagreement over whether his work in the field produced a complete narrative or just fragments . The scarcity of writings he left is contrasted by their critical acclaim and a large , mostly posthumous , following , commonly known as mateists .

		CONTEXT=President François Tombalbaye faced a task of considerable magnitude when Chad became a sovereign state in 1960 . His challenge was to build a nation out of a vast and diverse territory that had poor communications , few known resources , a tiny market , and a collection of impoverished people with sharply differing political traditions , ethnic and regional loyalties , and sociocultural patterns . The French colonial powers that had created the country 's boundaries had done little to promote economic interdependence , political cooperation , or crosscultural understanding . Chadians who had hoped that the country 's first president might turn out to be a state builder like the 13th century 's Dabbalemi or the 16th century 's Aluma were soon disappointed . During its first fifteen years , Chad under Tombalbaye experienced worsening economic conditions , eventual alienation of the most patient of foreign allies , exacerbation of ethnic and regional conflict , and grave weakening of the state as an instrument of governance .

		CONTEXT=The Cherry Hill Arena was an indoor arena located in Cherry Hill , New Jersey , built in 1959 . It was originally known as the Ice House and renamed the Delaware Valley Gardens before assuming its most familiar name . The arena , which seated 4,416 , was the home of the short - lived Jersey Larks of the Eastern Hockey League in 1960 - 61 and hosted occasional home games of the NBA Philadelphia Warriors . In 1964 EHL hockey returned to the arena in the form of the Jersey Devils , who would be the arena 's longest - lasting tenants , surviving until the EHL folded in 1973 . Early in the 1973 – 1974 hockey season , the New York Golden Blades of the World Hockey Association moved to the arena and played there as the New Jersey Knights for the rest of the season . Sports Illustrated later described Cherry Hill Arena as " perhaps the worst facility " used by any WHA team , noting that it lacked showers in the dressing room for visiting teams , who had to dress at a Holiday Inn two miles away , and that the arena 's ice surface was not even level , giving the home team a distinct home advantage as the visitors would have to skate uphill to the opponent 's goal .

		CONTEXT=Reviews of '' Under Rug Swept '' on its release were generally positive . '' Billboard '' described the album as " supreme " and " very human ... it satisfies with moments of darkness , enlightenment , anger , bittersweet tension , and happiness ... Although 2002 is still young , consider '' Under Rug Swept '' one of the year 's best . " '' Q '' magazine said the album was " a smart shot across the bows ... some of the most inviting music of her career ... Morissette has fashioned a lyrical Trojan Horse to be wheeled into unsuspecting homes for months to come . " Robert Christgau wrote , " The pop-rock here lacks the faux-punk edge on '' Jagged Little Pill '' ... But Morissette instantly demonstrates her gift for the catchy ... topping memorable verse with indelible chorus , she 's a self-actualized nut who goes for what she wants , exactly as pretentious as the college girls she represents for . " According to '' LA Weekly '' , the album " is Alanis Morissette in top form , exercising her God-given right to vent and sound beautiful doing so . " Other critical appraisals were less favorable . '' Rolling Stone '' , in a three-star review , wrote " The music is brawny and meticulous ... but '' Under Rug Swept '' just about drowns in psychobabble . While the tone of the songs , and the grain of Morissette 's voice , promise intimacy , there 's hardly a private detail anywhere . " '' Entertainment Weekly '' said " the album 's garbled title is also preparation for some of the clumsiest lyrics to be heard on a pop record in years ... The songs are riddled with such overwritten Psych 101 ruminations . " '' The Village Voice '' criticised the lyrics , saying " Much like even non-football fans used to be mesmerized by Howard Cosell 's genius for never using two words when 23 would do , you do n't have to be a love-damaged 17-year-old girl to find '' Under Rug Swept '' 's dense verbiage a trip . Words tumble forth and arrange themselves kaleidoscopically into all sorts of unusual categories ... I 'm just not sure that pop music should come out of a thesaurus . " '' NME '' called it " a tedious album " with " overwrought folk-rock like ' Surrendering ' and ' Hands Clean ' destined for a thousand organic juice bars . Lyrically , it 's often hilarious ... This record moves way beyond armchair psychology — in fact , there are armchairs that have a cannier grasp of the mind . " '' Under Rug Swept '' received a Juno Award nomination in the category of " Pop Album of the Year " . Morissette herself won the " Jack Richardson Producer of the Year " award for the songs " Hands Clean " and " So Unsexy " , and she was nominated in the " Artist of the Year " category . ( For more information , see Juno Awards of 2003 . ) '' Under Rug Swept '' entered the Canadian albums chart at number one with first week sales of 35,000 copies , and the CRIA certified it platinum the following month for shipments of 100,000 . In the U.S. the album sold 215,000 copies in its first week , debuting at number one on the '' Billboard '' 200 chart during a busy sales week following the 2002 Grammy Awards ceremony ; it stayed in the top spot for a week . Within a month of release it had sold 500,000 copies , and the RIAA certified it platinum for shipments of over one million . '' Under Rug Swept '' debuted at number one in 12 countries , including Germany , Japan and Australia .

The site 's critical consensus states , " Vibrant and charming , '' Stranger Things '' transforms itself into a riveting — if familiar — summer ride that basks in its neon-laden nostalgia without losing sight of the rich relationships that make the series so endearing . " On Metacritic , the third season has a weighted average score of 72 out of 100 , based on 24 critics , indicating " generally favorable reviews . " Writing in the '' New Statesman '' , Emily Bootle considered the third season an improvement on the second : " ... after a confused and rambling season two , the third season of Stranger Things is a return to strength – where season two had something of an identity crisis , season three has largely brought back what made the show unique in the first place . " Hugh Montgomery at ''BBC.com '' awarded 5 stars , describing the third season as " an exhilarating example of a franchise hitting new heights that Hollywood would do well to learn from . " On the dissenting side , Darren Franich of '' Entertainment Weekly '' criticized the third season for looking like a Reagan-era pop culture mixtape . Ed Power of '' The Telegraph '' blamed Duffer Brothers for refusing " to stray from the Goonies-meets-Stephen King formula " and recycling their " well-worn bag of retro references to increasingly underwhelming effect " , producing the limpest installment of the three . His opinion was echoed by Hank Stuever of '' The Washington Post '' , who felt almost heartbroken for " the Duffers working so hard to re-create an elusive vibe " of 1980s with a " mishmash of ingredients : John Carpenter , Steven Spielberg , Stephen King , Freddy Krueger , Rambo , the Terminator , the aliens of LV-426 " only to fail to create a fully entertaining show . Writing in '' National Review '' , Daniel Payne criticized the season 's " sloppy storytelling " and " cornball humor " compared to the previous seasons , claiming that season three was " frenetic and bewildering where the first two seasons were slow , careful , and rewarding in crafting their plots .

		CONTEXT=Whit Burnett ( August 14 , 1899 – April 22 , 1973 ) was an American writer and writing teacher who founded and edited the literary magazine Story . In the 1940s , Story was an important magazine in that it published the first or early works of many writers who went on to become major authors . Not only did Burnett prove to be a valuable literary birddog for new talent , but Story remained a respectable though low - paying ( typically $ 25 per story ) alternative for stories rejected by the large - circulation slick magazines published on glossy paper like Collier 's or The Saturday Evening Post or the somewhat more prestigious and literary slick magazines such as The New Yorker . While Story paid poorly compared to the slicks and even the pulps and successor digest - sized magazines of its day , it paid better than most of , and had similar cachet to , the university - based and the other independent " little magazines " of its era .

		CONTEXT=Mono Masters is a compilation album by the Beatles , and is an alternate , all - mono version of the album Past Masters . Mono Masters was originally a two - CD set included as part of The Beatles in Mono box set . The premise of this box set was to compile only Beatles material which was released or prepared for release with a dedicated mono mix ( the set excludes later material mixed and released only in stereo , and material whose mono version was simply created as an equal mix of the two channels of the stereo version , i.e. 1969 's Yellow Submarine album ) . As a result , the track listing for Mono Masters differs from Past Masters on the second half of disc two , omitting some later songs that never had a mono mix ( " Old Brown Shoe " , " The Ballad of John and Yoko " and " Let It Be " ) , and adding several songs released on stereo - only albums that had unreleased mono mixes . Tracks 9 – 12 and 15 were prepared in March 1969 for release as a 7 " mono Yellow Submarine EP , two months after the release of the similarly titled soundtrack album , but the project was scrapped , although the EP was mastered . Subsequently , the tracks were only released in stereo ( and in an electronically produced mono mixdown , or " fold - down " , of the stereo mix ) , while the true mono mixes remained unreleased . " Get Back " ( with B - side " Do n't Let Me Down " ) was the final Beatles single mixed for mono format . It was released in the UK in mono , though the US release was in stereo . Thus , the songs that were originally released on stereo singles in the UK are omitted on this release .

It starred Patrick Bergin as Burton and Iain Glen as Speke , and was hailed by critic Roger Ebert as " completely absorbing . " Ebert continued , " It tells its story soberly and intelligently , and with quiet style ... It 's the kind of movie that sends you away from the screen filled with curiosity to know more about this man Burton . " In '' Newsweek '' , critic Jack Kroll wrote , " The exploits of Sir Richard Francis Burton make Lawrence of Arabia look like a tourist . . . . From scene to scene this film grips you as few movies do , moving between Africa and England to spotlight an extraordinary range of characters in both ' primitive ' and ' civilized ' cultures : from the African tribal chiefs , mild or murderous , to the nabobs of the Royal Geographical Society , honest or treacherous . " Rafelson later observed , " I was very lucky to make that movie . And I can tell you , if there was ever a movie that I enjoyed making , it was that one . " In 1992 Rafelson teamed up with Nicholson and '' Five Easy Pieces '' screenwriter Carole Eastman for the film '' Man Trouble '' . In 1996 he made his last film with Nicholson to date , '' Blood and Wine '' . His most recent films are 1998 's '' Poodle Springs '' and 2002 's '' No Good Deed '' , based on works by Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett , respectively .

'' Billboard '' described the album as " supreme " and " very human ... it satisfies with moments of darkness , enlightenment , anger , bittersweet tension , and happiness ... Although 2002 is still young , consider '' Under Rug Swept '' one of the year 's best . " '' Q '' magazine said the album was " a smart shot across the bows ... some of the most inviting music of her career ... Morissette has fashioned a lyrical Trojan Horse to be wheeled into unsuspecting homes for months to come . " Robert Christgau wrote , " The pop-rock here lacks the faux-punk edge on '' Jagged Little Pill '' ... But Morissette instantly demonstrates her gift for the catchy ... topping memorable verse with indelible chorus , she 's a self-actualized nut who goes for what she wants , exactly as pretentious as the college girls she represents for . " According to '' LA Weekly '' , the album " is Alanis Morissette in top form , exercising her God-given right to vent and sound beautiful doing so . " Other critical appraisals were less favorable . '' Rolling Stone '' , in a three-star review , wrote " The music is brawny and meticulous ... but '' Under Rug Swept '' just about drowns in psychobabble . While the tone of the songs , and the grain of Morissette 's voice , promise intimacy , there 's hardly a private detail anywhere . " '' Entertainment Weekly '' said " the album 's garbled title is also preparation for some of the clumsiest lyrics to be heard on a pop record in years ... The songs are riddled with such overwritten Psych 101 ruminations . " '' The Village Voice '' criticised the lyrics , saying " Much like even non-football fans used to be mesmerized by Howard Cosell 's genius for never using two words when 23 would do , you do n't have to be a love-damaged 17-year-old girl to find '' Under Rug Swept '' 's dense verbiage a trip . Words tumble forth and arrange themselves kaleidoscopically into all sorts of unusual categories ... I 'm just not sure that pop music should come out of a thesaurus . " '' NME '' called it " a tedious album " with " overwrought folk-rock like ' Surrendering ' and ' Hands Clean ' destined for a thousand organic juice bars . Lyrically , it 's often hilarious ... This record moves way beyond armchair psychology — in fact , there are armchairs that have a cannier grasp of the mind . " '' Under Rug Swept '' received a Juno Award nomination in the category of " Pop Album of the Year " . Morissette herself won the " Jack Richardson Producer of the Year " award for the songs " Hands Clean " and " So Unsexy " , and she was nominated in the " Artist of the Year " category . ( For more information , see Juno Awards of 2003 . ) '' Under Rug Swept '' entered the Canadian albums chart at number one with first week sales of 35,000 copies , and the CRIA certified it platinum the following month for shipments of 100,000 . In the U.S. the album sold 215,000 copies in its first week , debuting at number one on the '' Billboard '' 200 chart during a busy sales week following the 2002 Grammy Awards ceremony ; it stayed in the top spot for a week .

" In '' Newsweek '' , critic Jack Kroll wrote , " The exploits of Sir Richard Francis Burton make Lawrence of Arabia look like a tourist . . . . From scene to scene this film grips you as few movies do , moving between Africa and England to spotlight an extraordinary range of characters in both ' primitive ' and ' civilized ' cultures : from the African tribal chiefs , mild or murderous , to the nabobs of the Royal Geographical Society , honest or treacherous . " Rafelson later observed , " I was very lucky to make that movie . And I can tell you , if there was ever a movie that I enjoyed making , it was that one . " In 1992 Rafelson teamed up with Nicholson and '' Five Easy Pieces '' screenwriter Carole Eastman for the film '' Man Trouble '' . In 1996 he made his last film with Nicholson to date , '' Blood and Wine '' . His most recent films are 1998 's '' Poodle Springs '' and 2002 's '' No Good Deed '' , based on works by Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett , respectively . '' No Good Deed '' was entered into the 24th Moscow International Film Festival

Six initial volumes were released between 1918 and 1924 , with a new incarnation of the journal publishing from 1945 to 1953 , the latter edited by Dov Sadan .

		CONTEXT=The Cherry Hill Arena was an indoor arena located in Cherry Hill , New Jersey , built in 1959 . It was originally known as the Ice House and renamed the Delaware Valley Gardens before assuming its most familiar name . The arena , which seated 4,416 , was the home of the short - lived Jersey Larks of the Eastern Hockey League in 1960 - 61 and hosted occasional home games of the NBA Philadelphia Warriors . In 1964 EHL hockey returned to the arena in the form of the Jersey Devils , who would be the arena 's longest - lasting tenants , surviving until the EHL folded in 1973 . Early in the 1973 – 1974 hockey season , the New York Golden Blades of the World Hockey Association moved to the arena and played there as the New Jersey Knights for the rest of the season . Sports Illustrated later described Cherry Hill Arena as " perhaps the worst facility " used by any WHA team , noting that it lacked showers in the dressing room for visiting teams , who had to dress at a Holiday Inn two miles away , and that the arena 's ice surface was not even level , giving the home team a distinct home advantage as the visitors would have to skate uphill to the opponent 's goal .

		GOLD_MENTION=1903 collapse of Turtle Mountain
		CONTEXT=As the train proceeds eastward , the film tells the story of the challenges the builders faced in the granite cliffs of the Fraser Valley , where thousands of lives were lost ; among the fragile , erosive sandstone hoodoos of the Thompson River ; and bypassing the vast , deep lakes of the interior . As 2816 passes through Rogers Pass , the film explores the results of the gamble taken by the CPR and General Manager Van Horne to set aside the recommended northerly route in favour of a more southerly route that would dissuade incursions from American railroads but depended on an as-yet-undiscovered pass through the Selkirks and a viable pass through the steep Rockies . Coming out of the Selkirks , the film takes a side trip southbound along the Columbia River and with the use of CGI , tells the story of the 1903 collapse of Turtle Mountain , which partially buried the mining town of Frank , Alberta , and the heroic rescue of an oncoming train . Returning to the main line , the train follows the Kicking Horse River up the west side of the Rocky Mountains and the film looks at the challenges faced by the builders and the engines coping with the dangerous grades of the ‘ Big Hill ’ . As the train passes the continental divide , the sun comes out both literally and metaphorically on the majestic Rocky Mountains . This chapter celebrates the completion of the railway , the creation of Canada ’s national parks system , and the birth of a flourishing tourism trade before bringing the audience and railway crashing back to face the reality of the inestimable difficulties of winter in the mountains , and particularly the Selkirks . The film ends with the train steaming off across the prairies to cross the continent and arrive in the port city of Montreal . The final moments are shots of the weathered stone and wood gravestones of unnamed workers — a monument to “ the country they built — Canada . ” A train and history buff , writer/director Stephen Low had wanted to tell the story of the building of the CPR through Rogers ’ Pass following the success of his first 35 mm documentary , Challenger : An Industrial Romance ( 1980 ) , made at Canada ’s National Film Board . At the time the financing for the 35 mm project fell through , a disappointment which he now considers a blessing . Low says he was flabbergasted when he heard the CPR was restoring 2816 , which would enable him to tell the story from the viewpoint of a live steam engine . “ I always wanted to do this film regarding the single greatest Canadian story , ” he says . “ I wanted to tell it in IMAX because when you get up in a helicopter and look down , you say , ' Holy cow ! How could they have done that in the 1880s ? ' So every single shot is an illustration of the courage of these ( workers ) , in my view . They overcame incredible difficulties , the workers . There were a lot of deaths , from blasting and avalanches . In the end , the thesis of the film is that those difficulties made possible the things we treasure the most in Canada . ” Production began in 2006 when Low learned that 2816 was going to be travelling through Montreal and got permission to do a few days of filming with the IMAX camera . The resulting demo was shown to the CPR who agreed to cooperate with the production of a full-length IMAX film shot primarily on the main line between Vancouver and Calgary . Over the next five years , the Calgary-based CPR and the steam program worked together with the Montreal-based production company to fit in one or two shoots a year . The scheduling challenges included the availability and location of the locomotive , the traffic on the main line between Calgary and Vancouver , the weather in the mountains , and the availability of the production company , which was also simultaneously making three IMAX 3D films

		CONTEXT=Reviews of '' Under Rug Swept '' on its release were generally positive . '' Billboard '' described the album as " supreme " and " very human ... it satisfies with moments of darkness , enlightenment , anger , bittersweet tension , and happiness ... Although 2002 is still young , consider '' Under Rug Swept '' one of the year 's best . " '' Q '' magazine said the album was " a smart shot across the bows ... some of the most inviting music of her career ... Morissette has fashioned a lyrical Trojan Horse to be wheeled into unsuspecting homes for months to come . " Robert Christgau wrote , " The pop-rock here lacks the faux-punk edge on '' Jagged Little Pill '' ... But Morissette instantly demonstrates her gift for the catchy ... topping memorable verse with indelible chorus , she 's a self-actualized nut who goes for what she wants , exactly as pretentious as the college girls she represents for . " According to '' LA Weekly '' , the album " is Alanis Morissette in top form , exercising her God-given right to vent and sound beautiful doing so . " Other critical appraisals were less favorable . '' Rolling Stone '' , in a three-star review , wrote " The music is brawny and meticulous ... but '' Under Rug Swept '' just about drowns in psychobabble . While the tone of the songs , and the grain of Morissette 's voice , promise intimacy , there 's hardly a private detail anywhere . " '' Entertainment Weekly '' said " the album 's garbled title is also preparation for some of the clumsiest lyrics to be heard on a pop record in years ... The songs are riddled with such overwritten Psych 101 ruminations . " '' The Village Voice '' criticised the lyrics , saying " Much like even non-football fans used to be mesmerized by Howard Cosell 's genius for never using two words when 23 would do , you do n't have to be a love-damaged 17-year-old girl to find '' Under Rug Swept '' 's dense verbiage a trip . Words tumble forth and arrange themselves kaleidoscopically into all sorts of unusual categories ... I 'm just not sure that pop music should come out of a thesaurus . " '' NME '' called it " a tedious album " with " overwrought folk-rock like ' Surrendering ' and ' Hands Clean ' destined for a thousand organic juice bars . Lyrically , it 's often hilarious ... This record moves way beyond armchair psychology — in fact , there are armchairs that have a cannier grasp of the mind . " '' Under Rug Swept '' received a Juno Award nomination in the category of " Pop Album of the Year " . Morissette herself won the " Jack Richardson Producer of the Year " award for the songs " Hands Clean " and " So Unsexy " , and she was nominated in the " Artist of the Year " category . ( For more information , see Juno Awards of 2003 . ) '' Under Rug Swept '' entered the Canadian albums chart at number one with first week sales of 35,000 copies , and the CRIA certified it platinum the following month for shipments of 100,000 . In the U.S. the album sold 215,000 copies in its first week , debuting at number one on the '' Billboard '' 200 chart during a busy sales week following the 2002 Grammy Awards ceremony ; it stayed in the top spot for a week .

'' Billboard '' described the album as " supreme " and " very human ... it satisfies with moments of darkness , enlightenment , anger , bittersweet tension , and happiness ... Although 2002 is still young , consider '' Under Rug Swept '' one of the year 's best . " '' Q '' magazine said the album was " a smart shot across the bows ... some of the most inviting music of her career ... Morissette has fashioned a lyrical Trojan Horse to be wheeled into unsuspecting homes for months to come . " Robert Christgau wrote , " The pop-rock here lacks the faux-punk edge on '' Jagged Little Pill '' ... But Morissette instantly demonstrates her gift for the catchy ... topping memorable verse with indelible chorus , she 's a self-actualized nut who goes for what she wants , exactly as pretentious as the college girls she represents for . " According to '' LA Weekly '' , the album " is Alanis Morissette in top form , exercising her God-given right to vent and sound beautiful doing so . " Other critical appraisals were less favorable . '' Rolling Stone '' , in a three-star review , wrote " The music is brawny and meticulous ... but '' Under Rug Swept '' just about drowns in psychobabble . While the tone of the songs , and the grain of Morissette 's voice , promise intimacy , there 's hardly a private detail anywhere . " '' Entertainment Weekly '' said " the album 's garbled title is also preparation for some of the clumsiest lyrics to be heard on a pop record in years ... The songs are riddled with such overwritten Psych 101 ruminations . " '' The Village Voice '' criticised the lyrics , saying " Much like even non-football fans used to be mesmerized by Howard Cosell 's genius for never using two words when 23 would do , you do n't have to be a love-damaged 17-year-old girl to find '' Under Rug Swept '' 's dense verbiage a trip . Words tumble forth and arrange themselves kaleidoscopically into all sorts of unusual categories ... I 'm just not sure that pop music should come out of a thesaurus . " '' NME '' called it " a tedious album " with " overwrought folk-rock like ' Surrendering ' and ' Hands Clean ' destined for a thousand organic juice bars . Lyrically , it 's often hilarious ... This record moves way beyond armchair psychology — in fact , there are armchairs that have a cannier grasp of the mind . " '' Under Rug Swept '' received a Juno Award nomination in the category of " Pop Album of the Year " . Morissette herself won the " Jack Richardson Producer of the Year " award for the songs " Hands Clean " and " So Unsexy " , and she was nominated in the " Artist of the Year " category .

On May 27 , 2014 Cyrus performed the song during the World Music Awards held in Monte Carlo , Monaco ; where she also won four World Music Awards . She wore a gown with a scenic theme based on flowers during the performance . It received positive reviews for its understated simplicity and strong vocal delivery . Cyrus returned to perform the song during the musical festival on June 21 , 2014 , Summertime Ball at Wembley Stadium of London , in front of 80,000 people . Cyrus has performed the song during her ongoing Bangerz Tour . A critic from the '' Nashville Scene '' praised the performance , writing , " Wrecking Ball was sung by Miley and earnestly shouted in unison by the arena , some of the audience tearing up . " Blake Hannon praised Cyrus ' vocal delivery , writing , " The crowd kept going when things slowed down for Wrecking Ball . It was the highlight of the night , and not because of anything visual . The costumed characters vanished and the screen was black , with Cyrus belting out one of the best pop power ballads in recent memory with only a smattering of lights . It 's a reminder that beneath it all , Cyrus has a voice — and a pretty big one , at that . " In September 2013 , British singer-songwriter James Arthur covered " Wrecking Ball " on Radio Hamburg in Germany . Later that month , The Gregory Brothers released a country version , which Laura Vitto from Mashable felt " trades in Miley 's pop-ballad sound for a twangier feel .

		CONTEXT=In 1990 Rafelson directed '' Mountains of the Moon '' , a film about the 1857 – 58 journey of Richard Francis Burton and John Hanning Speke in their expedition to central Africa — the project that culminated in Speke 's discovery of the source of the Nile River . It starred Patrick Bergin as Burton and Iain Glen as Speke , and was hailed by critic Roger Ebert as " completely absorbing . " Ebert continued , " It tells its story soberly and intelligently , and with quiet style ... It 's the kind of movie that sends you away from the screen filled with curiosity to know more about this man Burton . " In '' Newsweek '' , critic Jack Kroll wrote , " The exploits of Sir Richard Francis Burton make Lawrence of Arabia look like a tourist . . . . From scene to scene this film grips you as few movies do , moving between Africa and England to spotlight an extraordinary range of characters in both ' primitive ' and ' civilized ' cultures : from the African tribal chiefs , mild or murderous , to the nabobs of the Royal Geographical Society , honest or treacherous . " Rafelson later observed , " I was very lucky to make that movie . And I can tell you , if there was ever a movie that I enjoyed making , it was that one . " In 1992 Rafelson teamed up with Nicholson and '' Five Easy Pieces '' screenwriter Carole Eastman for the film '' Man Trouble '' . In 1996 he made his last film with Nicholson to date , '' Blood and Wine '' . His most recent films are 1998 's '' Poodle Springs '' and 2002 's '' No Good Deed '' , based on works by Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett , respectively .
