		GOLD_MENTION=2010 AFL Rising Star
		CONTEXT=He arrived at the club as an incredibly shy and underdeveloped personality , a fact that was noted by teammate Trent Cotchin who said though Martin was 18 “ he seemed much younger in some of the ways he behaved . ” Indeed , he struggled initially to adjust to the expectations of professional football . In one incident in the 2010 preseason he was removed from training and verbally reprimanded by club leadership when he was deemed unfit to train after a big night out . Despite these struggles , his on-field development was such that he would still debut in the 2010 season 's opening match , a 56-point Richmond loss against at the MCG . Martin recorded the sixth most disposals of any Tiger ( 18 ) to go along with four marks , three tackles and three clearances . Two weeks later Martin was convicted by the AFL tribunal for a high hit on Sydney 's Josh Kennedy in round 3 . He did not receive a suspension for the incident however , returning to football the following week . After four matches Martin ranked fourth in the league for clearances and eighth for hard-ball gets . Media reports emerged after round 8 that the 18 year old Martin had received a significant contract offer from expansion club the Greater Western Sydney Giants . The offer , which the Herald Sun ’s Mark Robinson claimed to be worth $ 2.4 million over three seasons , would have taken effect in the new club 's first AFL season in 2012 . Martin later said he had never entertained the idea of moving to the start-up club . In round 10 he had gained attention for his on-field efforts again , this time being nominated for the 2010 AFL Rising Star award after a 21 disposal and 11 clearance match against Port Adelaide . Due to his previous tribunal conviction however , Martin was ruled ineligible for the award and thus did not officially place in the end of season award 's points tally . He drew the attention of Sydney coach Paul Roos by round 14 , prompting Roos to send veteran Brett Kirk onto Martin in a tagging role . Despite this extra attention , he still managed to record 18 disposals and a goal in the match at the MCG . After 17 rounds Martin ranked second at the club for clearances and inside 50s as well as third for disposals and contested possessions .

In the early hours of 1 May , security forces arrested some 225 individuals for questioning , mostly from the dead three 's home villages and from the area where they lived in Shubra .

		CONTEXT=Hunt starred in Woody Allen 's '' The Curse of the Jade Scorpion '' ( 2001 ) , as an efficiency expert hypnotized by a crooked hypnotist into stealing jewels . Despite the film 's limited success , Roger Ebert asserted : " Hunt in particular has fun with a wisecracking dame role that owes something , perhaps , to Rosalind Russell in '' His Girl Friday '' . " In 2003 , Hunt returned to Broadway in Yasmina Reza 's '' Life x 3 '' , and in 2004 , she starred in the drama '' A Good Woman '' , as a femme fatale in 1930s NYC . '' AV Club '' , in its review for the latter , remarked : " Helen Hunt looks embarrassingly out of place trying to play an infamous seductress " . She played a socialite , as part of an ensemble cast , in Emilio Estevez 's drama '' Bobby '' ( 2006 ) , about the hours leading up to the Robert F. Kennedy assassination . As a member of the cast , she was nominated for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Cast in a Motion Picture but won the Hollywood Film Festival Award for Best Ensemble Cast . Hunt made her feature film directorial debut in '' Then She Found Me '' ( 2007 ) , in which she also starred as a 39-year-old Brooklyn elementary school teacher , who after years is contacted by the flamboyant host of a local talk show , played by Bette Midler , who introduces herself as her biological mother . After first reading Elinor Lipman 's novel , she tried to interest numerous studios in the material , and her unsuccessful efforts led her to begin writing the screenplay and raising funds to produce it herself . Upon its release , Ruthe Stein of the '' San Francisco Chronicle '' observed , " You would think that frontloading '' Then She Found Me '' with so much plot would make it play like a soap opera . But Hunt saves the movie from this fate in two ways . First she turns in a touchingly real performance , the best of her big-screen career . Forget that '' As Good as It Gets '' won her an Oscar . She 's eons better and more realistic in this one ... By directing '' Then She Found Me '' , Helen becomes its savior as well ... Hunt knows when to rein in the Divine Miss M instead of allowing her to go into full Kabuki mode . She also coaxes pitch-perfect performances from Broderick and Firth . " Hunt starred in the dramedy '' Every Day '' ( 2010 ) , as one half of a married couple pulled apart by increasing responsibilities . According to '' Los Angeles Times '' , the film " comes as a reminder of Hunt 's talent for understatement , and a wish to see more of her " . In the biographical drama '' Soul Surfer '' ( 2011 ) , she played the mother of the Hawaiian-born champion surfer Bethany Hamilton , on whose life the film was based . Her first wide release since 2001 's '' The Curse of the Jade Scorpion '' , '' Soul Surfer '' made US$ 47.1 million internationally . Hunt starred as sex surrogate Cheryl Cohen-Greene in '' The Sessions '' ( 2012 ) , alongside John Hawkes and William H. Macy . The role required Hunt to perform multiple scenes of full-frontal nudity , on which she further said : " Being naked was challenging , but even more than that was the vulnerability . I felt vulnerable because I was naked . I felt vulnerable because we were having such a vulnerable moment in this character 's life . This was a real journey that someone had gone on , and I wanted to do right by that . " Her performance was acclaimed by critics and earned her several award nominations , including an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress . Todd McCarthy of '' The Hollywood Reporter '' wrote : " Hunt 's performance may be physically bold but is equally marked by its maturity and composure . " Hunt played research geneticist Mary-Claire King in the independent drama '' Decoding Annie Parker '' ( 2013 ) , which was released to a mixed critical response . She wrote and directed the drama '' Ride '' ( 2014 ) , in which she also starred as a mother who travels cross-country to California to be with her son after he decides to drop out of school and become a surfer . Rotten Tomatoes ' critical consensus read : " '' Ride '' reaffirms Helen Hunt 's immense acting talent — but suggests that she still needs time to develop as a director . " In '' The Miracle Season '' ( 2018 ) , based on the true story of the Iowa City West High School volleyball team , Hunt played Kathy Bresnahan , a volleyball coach

		CONTEXT=The design team for the series conceived eighteen outfits to compliment Gaga 's outré and eccentric reputation , although they did not collaborate with any of Gaga 's stylists or creative director Nicola Formichetti . Due to the outfits ' unconventional appearances , Jean was given more freedom to animate the large array of costumes , as these rapid changes " would n't be possible in real life " . " There 's a moment in the episode , " Jean resumed , " when she starts out with her hair down . Then , there 's a curtain pulled in front of her , and in seconds , she has a completely different outfit on with a cone bra and her hair is all hairsprayed up and big and frizzy . In real life , that would probably take 8 hours . " Many of the costumes were inspired from previous outfits Gaga had worn , including her meat dress and her Kermit the Frog dress . " We did a lot of research , looking back at her old outfits , and she 's really been in a million different things , had a million different looks . " Many aspects of Gaga 's career are referenced in the episode . " You 're All My Little Monsters " , a musical number specifically created for the episode , is a parody of Gaga 's relationship with her devout " Little Monsters " — a phrase Gaga uses to refer to her fans . To '' Spin '' columnist Devon Maloney , the song was ultimately an overtly cartoonized version of her single " Born This Way " ( 2011 ) that embraces the " freakiness " of Springfield . Several of Gaga 's outfits and looks emulate several iconic costumes the singer had previously worn , such as the " Living Dress " and pyrotechnic leotard she wore during her endeavors on The Monster Ball Tour , as well as her wardrobe at the 53rd Grammy Awards . One in particular , a dress consisting of pork chops , is a parody of the singer 's meat dress , which she wore at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards . During the credits of " Lisa Goes Gaga " , main character Homer Simpson performs a rendition of " Poker Face " ( 2009 ) . At the end of the episode , a title card promotes the Maggie-starring short film '' The Longest Daycare '' , which was shown before '' Ice Age : Continental Drift '' ( 2012 )

		CONTEXT=Hunt starred in Woody Allen 's '' The Curse of the Jade Scorpion '' ( 2001 ) , as an efficiency expert hypnotized by a crooked hypnotist into stealing jewels . Despite the film 's limited success , Roger Ebert asserted : " Hunt in particular has fun with a wisecracking dame role that owes something , perhaps , to Rosalind Russell in '' His Girl Friday '' . " In 2003 , Hunt returned to Broadway in Yasmina Reza 's '' Life x 3 '' , and in 2004 , she starred in the drama '' A Good Woman '' , as a femme fatale in 1930s NYC . '' AV Club '' , in its review for the latter , remarked : " Helen Hunt looks embarrassingly out of place trying to play an infamous seductress " . She played a socialite , as part of an ensemble cast , in Emilio Estevez 's drama '' Bobby '' ( 2006 ) , about the hours leading up to the Robert F. Kennedy assassination . As a member of the cast , she was nominated for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Cast in a Motion Picture but won the Hollywood Film Festival Award for Best Ensemble Cast . Hunt made her feature film directorial debut in '' Then She Found Me '' ( 2007 ) , in which she also starred as a 39-year-old Brooklyn elementary school teacher , who after years is contacted by the flamboyant host of a local talk show , played by Bette Midler , who introduces herself as her biological mother . After first reading Elinor Lipman 's novel , she tried to interest numerous studios in the material , and her unsuccessful efforts led her to begin writing the screenplay and raising funds to produce it herself . Upon its release , Ruthe Stein of the '' San Francisco Chronicle '' observed , " You would think that frontloading '' Then She Found Me '' with so much plot would make it play like a soap opera . But Hunt saves the movie from this fate in two ways . First she turns in a touchingly real performance , the best of her big-screen career . Forget that '' As Good as It Gets '' won her an Oscar . She 's eons better and more realistic in this one ... By directing '' Then She Found Me '' , Helen becomes its savior as well ... Hunt knows when to rein in the Divine Miss M instead of allowing her to go into full Kabuki mode . She also coaxes pitch-perfect performances from Broderick and Firth . " Hunt starred in the dramedy '' Every Day '' ( 2010 ) , as one half of a married couple pulled apart by increasing responsibilities . According to '' Los Angeles Times '' , the film " comes as a reminder of Hunt 's talent for understatement , and a wish to see more of her " . In the biographical drama '' Soul Surfer '' ( 2011 ) , she played the mother of the Hawaiian-born champion surfer Bethany Hamilton , on whose life the film was based . Her first wide release since 2001 's '' The Curse of the Jade Scorpion '' , '' Soul Surfer '' made US$ 47.1 million internationally . Hunt starred as sex surrogate Cheryl Cohen-Greene in '' The Sessions '' ( 2012 ) , alongside John Hawkes and William H. Macy . The role required Hunt to perform multiple scenes of full-frontal nudity , on which she further said : " Being naked was challenging , but even more than that was the vulnerability . I felt vulnerable because I was naked . I felt vulnerable because we were having such a vulnerable moment in this character 's life . This was a real journey that someone had gone on , and I wanted to do right by that . " Her performance was acclaimed by critics and earned her several award nominations , including an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress . Todd McCarthy of '' The Hollywood Reporter '' wrote : " Hunt 's performance may be physically bold but is equally marked by its maturity and composure . " Hunt played research geneticist Mary-Claire King in the independent drama '' Decoding Annie Parker '' ( 2013 ) , which was released to a mixed critical response . She wrote and directed the drama '' Ride '' ( 2014 ) , in which she also starred as a mother who travels cross-country to California to be with her son after he decides to drop out of school and become a surfer . Rotten Tomatoes ' critical consensus read : " '' Ride '' reaffirms Helen Hunt 's immense acting talent — but suggests that she still needs time to develop as a director . " In '' The Miracle Season '' ( 2018 ) , based on the true story of the Iowa City West High School volleyball team , Hunt played Kathy Bresnahan , a volleyball coach

On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes , the show holds an approval rating of 43 % based on 30 critics , and summarized , " The 90th Academy Awards played it safe and hit no major snags -- but by clocking in at over four hours , returning host Jimmy Kimmel and company wore out their welcome long before the surprise ending . " Hank Stuever of '' The Washington Post '' marked , " In his second year , Kimmel has shown that the telecast need n't be anything but sharp and sure , with a funny host whose bits are manageable , shareable and – best of all – forgotten . We 're not making showbiz history here ; we 're just trying to get through another Oscar night . " Chief critic David Edelstein of '' Vulture '' wrote , " This was the best , most inspiring , and most sheerly likable Academy Awards telecast I 've ever seen . ... It was also – in terms of the actual awards – among the most disappointing . " '' Vanity Fair '' s , Richard Lawson wrote , " As a host , Kimmel struck a careful , appropriately measured tone ... All told , Sunday 's ceremony did an admirable job of recognizing all the turmoil surrounding it while maintaining the silly , chintzy trappings that so many of us tune into the Oscars for . " CNN 's Brian Lowry quipped , " The Oscars are a big , unwieldy beast , which invariably try to serve too many masters . Yet if the intent was ultimately to maintain a celebratory tone without ignoring either the outside world or the elephant in the room throughout this year 's awards , host Jimmy Kimmel and the show itself largely succeeded . " Others were more critical of the show . Television critic Maureen Ryan of '' Variety '' said , " All things considered , the show had a more or less low-key vibe . Normally it takes about two hours for the numbing effect to set in , but despite host Jimmy Kimmel 's best efforts , Sunday 's telecast started to feel a bit languid and low-energy far earlier . " Television critic James Poniewozik of '' The New York Times '' said , " despite the recent upheaval in Hollywood , the ceremony at large still focused mainly on celebration and glitter literally , in the case of the blinding set , which looked as if the ceremony were encased in an enormous geode . There 's also the perennial problem of bloat . The hitch , of course , is that every part of the show has its constituency . " Darren Franich of '' Entertainment Weekly '' wrote , " What fun we had at this year 's Oscars ! Long show , sure , but where to cut it ? " Writing for '' Deadline '' Greg Evans said , " Did the nearly four-hour running time contain any moments for the Oscar ages ? Probably not . " David Wiegand of the '' San Francisco Chronicle '' wrote , " Even the hope that the noise of clapping might keep the audience at home and in the theater awake , there was little of that for anything except the entrance of actors of advance age . " '' The Oregonian '' columnist Kristi Turnquist wrote , " Was it respectful ? Absolutely . Did it make for kind of a dull , earnest Oscars show ? Yeah , kind of . " Attaining 26.5 million U.S. viewers according to Nielsen ratings , the ceremony 's telecast had a 16-percent drop in viewership from last year 's ceremony and had the lowest U.S. viewership in Oscar history . On March 6 , after the final ratings were confirmed , President Donald Trump took to his Twitter account , saying , " Lowest rated Oscars in HISTORY . Problem is , we do n't have stars anymore – except your President ( just kidding , of course ) ! " . In response , Kimmel also tweeted , saying , " Thanks , lowest rated President in HISTORY .

Following a performance by Lady Gaga at the 88th Academy Awards , in which several survivors of sexual abuse appeared with the singer , Larson hugged all of them as they exited the stage . At the following year 's ceremony , Larson presented Casey Affleck with the Best Actor Award , but due to sexual harassment allegations against him in the past , she did not clap for him during a standing ovation from the audience ; however , she did hug him ; she later stated that her action spoke for itself . In 2018 , she collaborated with 300 women in Hollywood to set up the Time 's Up initiative to protect women from harassment and discrimination . In the same year , she became one of the first actors to incorporate an inclusion rider provision in her film and press tour contracts . In an interview with '' Marie Claire '' , Larson spoke about diversity among film critics and journalists as she found them to be " overwhelmingly white male " . This comment led to trolling and review bombing of the '' Captain Marvel '' page on Rotten Tomatoes

		CONTEXT=Hunt starred in Woody Allen 's '' The Curse of the Jade Scorpion '' ( 2001 ) , as an efficiency expert hypnotized by a crooked hypnotist into stealing jewels . Despite the film 's limited success , Roger Ebert asserted : " Hunt in particular has fun with a wisecracking dame role that owes something , perhaps , to Rosalind Russell in '' His Girl Friday '' . " In 2003 , Hunt returned to Broadway in Yasmina Reza 's '' Life x 3 '' , and in 2004 , she starred in the drama '' A Good Woman '' , as a femme fatale in 1930s NYC . '' AV Club '' , in its review for the latter , remarked : " Helen Hunt looks embarrassingly out of place trying to play an infamous seductress " . She played a socialite , as part of an ensemble cast , in Emilio Estevez 's drama '' Bobby '' ( 2006 ) , about the hours leading up to the Robert F. Kennedy assassination . As a member of the cast , she was nominated for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Cast in a Motion Picture but won the Hollywood Film Festival Award for Best Ensemble Cast . Hunt made her feature film directorial debut in '' Then She Found Me '' ( 2007 ) , in which she also starred as a 39-year-old Brooklyn elementary school teacher , who after years is contacted by the flamboyant host of a local talk show , played by Bette Midler , who introduces herself as her biological mother . After first reading Elinor Lipman 's novel , she tried to interest numerous studios in the material , and her unsuccessful efforts led her to begin writing the screenplay and raising funds to produce it herself . Upon its release , Ruthe Stein of the '' San Francisco Chronicle '' observed , " You would think that frontloading '' Then She Found Me '' with so much plot would make it play like a soap opera . But Hunt saves the movie from this fate in two ways . First she turns in a touchingly real performance , the best of her big-screen career . Forget that '' As Good as It Gets '' won her an Oscar . She 's eons better and more realistic in this one ... By directing '' Then She Found Me '' , Helen becomes its savior as well ... Hunt knows when to rein in the Divine Miss M instead of allowing her to go into full Kabuki mode . She also coaxes pitch-perfect performances from Broderick and Firth . " Hunt starred in the dramedy '' Every Day '' ( 2010 ) , as one half of a married couple pulled apart by increasing responsibilities . According to '' Los Angeles Times '' , the film " comes as a reminder of Hunt 's talent for understatement , and a wish to see more of her " . In the biographical drama '' Soul Surfer '' ( 2011 ) , she played the mother of the Hawaiian-born champion surfer Bethany Hamilton , on whose life the film was based . Her first wide release since 2001 's '' The Curse of the Jade Scorpion '' , '' Soul Surfer '' made US$ 47.1 million internationally . Hunt starred as sex surrogate Cheryl Cohen-Greene in '' The Sessions '' ( 2012 ) , alongside John Hawkes and William H. Macy . The role required Hunt to perform multiple scenes of full-frontal nudity , on which she further said : " Being naked was challenging , but even more than that was the vulnerability . I felt vulnerable because I was naked . I felt vulnerable because we were having such a vulnerable moment in this character 's life . This was a real journey that someone had gone on , and I wanted to do right by that . " Her performance was acclaimed by critics and earned her several award nominations , including an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress . Todd McCarthy of '' The Hollywood Reporter '' wrote : " Hunt 's performance may be physically bold but is equally marked by its maturity and composure . " Hunt played research geneticist Mary-Claire King in the independent drama '' Decoding Annie Parker '' ( 2013 ) , which was released to a mixed critical response . She wrote and directed the drama '' Ride '' ( 2014 ) , in which she also starred as a mother who travels cross-country to California to be with her son after he decides to drop out of school and become a surfer . Rotten Tomatoes ' critical consensus read : " '' Ride '' reaffirms Helen Hunt 's immense acting talent — but suggests that she still needs time to develop as a director . " In '' The Miracle Season '' ( 2018 ) , based on the true story of the Iowa City West High School volleyball team , Hunt played Kathy Bresnahan , a volleyball coach

		CONTEXT=Perhaps the best known appearance of Cephalonia in popular culture is in the novel '' Captain Corelli 's Mandolin '' , by the English author Louis de Bernières . The book is believed to have been inspired by the village of Farsa , just outside Argostoli . The love story comprising the theme of the book is set before and after the Acqui Division massacre , during the Second World War . A film adaptation was released in 2001 . During filming there was lively debate between the production team , local authorities as well as groups of citizens , as to the complex historical details of the island 's antifascist resistance . As a result , political references were omitted from the film , and the romantic core of the book was preserved , without entering complex debates about the island 's history . In 2005 , Riccardo Milani made his TV movie , '' Cefalonia '' , also about the massacre , with music by Ennio Morricone

		CONTEXT=The British historian A. J. P. Taylor wrote in 1945 that National Socialism was inevitable because the Germans wanted " to repudiate the equality with the peoples of ( central and ) eastern Europe which had then been forced upon them " after 1918 . Taylor wrote that : " During the preceding eighty years the Germans had sacrificed to the '' Reich '' all their liberties ; they demanded as a reward the enslavement of others . No German recognized the Czechs or Poles as equals . Therefore , every German desired the achievement which only total war could give . By no other means could the '' Reich '' be held together . It had been made by conquest and for conquest ; if it ever gave up its career of conquest , it would dissolve . " During Stalin 's Great Terror in the Soviet Union , the largest ethnic shooting and deportation operation , known as the Polish Operation , took place from about 25 August 1937 through 15 November 1938 . According to Soviet NKVD archives , 111,091 Poles , and people accused of ties with Poland , were executed , and 28,744 were sentenced to death-ridden labor camps , for a total of 139,835 Polish victims . This number constitutes 10 per cent of the officially persecuted persons during the entire Yezhovshchina period , with confirming NKVD documents . The coordinated actions of the Soviet NKVD and the Communist Party in 1937 – 1938 against the Polish minority living in the Soviet Union was a targeting of 0.4 percent of Soviet citizens by ethnicity . US historian Timothy D. Snyder says : " It is hard not to see the Soviet " Polish Operation " of 1937-38 as genocidal . " Simon Sebag Montefiore presents a similar opinion , Prof. Marek Jan Chodakiewicz , Dr. Tomasz Sommer , and others . In typical Stalinist fashion , the murdered Polish families were accused of " anti-Soviet " activities and state terrorism . Michael Ellman has said in the context of the UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide that Stalin 's Polish Operation " might well qualify as genocide " but because there has been no legal tribunal to try the crimes of Stalinism , there is no authoritative ruling on the legal characterisation

		CONTEXT=The Red Army 's focus on mobile operations in the early 1930s was gravely disrupted by Stalin 's purge of the military 's leadership . Since the new doctrines were associated with officers who had been declared enemies of the state , the support for them declined . Many large mechanised formations were disbanded , with the tanks distributed to support the infantry . After the German blitzkrieg proved its potency in Poland and France , the Red Army started a frantic effort to rebuild the large mechanised corps , but the task was only partly finished when the Wehrmacht attacked in 1941 . The huge tank forces , powerful only on paper , were mostly annihilated by the Germans in the first months of Operation Barbarossa . Another factor contributing to the initial defeat was that the Soviet post-World War I rearmament effort was started too early , and in 1941 the majority of Soviet equipment was obsolete and inferior to that of the Wehrmacht

In 1925 she supported the Manifesto of the Anti-Fascist Intellectuals . Later in life , Aleramo toured the continent and was active in Communist politics after World War II . In 1948 she took part of World Congress of Intellectuals in Defense of Peace in Wrocław

		CONTEXT=In denying involvement in the Bologna massacre , Mambro later insisted that , far from being a well-supplied tool of hidden forces , Armed Revolutionary Nuclei were regarded as ' snotty kids ' by the established leaders of neofascism , and the group never had access to explosives in the quantity that the Bologna bomb used . She also said that Armed Revolutionary Nuclei had never deliberately targeted ordinary people . Fioravanti has said that the 1980 Bologna train station bombing was the work of Libya , and that the Italian state had been reluctant to pursue that line of enquiry because of dependence on Libya 's oil , and thus blamed neo-fascists

		CONTEXT=About Minoan warfare , Branigan concluded : Archaeologist Olga Krzyszkowska agreed : " The stark fact is that for the prehistoric Aegean we have no direct evidence for war and warfare '' per se '' . " Between 1935 and 1939 , Greek archaeologist Spyridon Marinatos posited the Minoan eruption theory . An eruption on the island of Thera ( present-day Santorini ) , about from Crete , occurred during the LM IA period ( 1550 – 1500 BC ) . One of the largest volcanic explosions in recorded history , it ejected about of material and was measured at 7 on the Volcanic Explosivity Index . The eruption devastated the nearby Minoan settlement at Akrotiri on Santorini , which was entombed in a layer of pumice . Although it is believed to have severely affected the Minoan culture of Crete , the extent of its effects has been debated . Early theories proposed that volcanic ash from Thera choked off plant life on the eastern half of Crete , starving the local population ; however , more-thorough field examinations have determined that no more than of ash fell anywhere on Crete . Based on archaeological evidence , studies indicate that a massive tsunami generated by the Thera eruption devastated the coast of Crete and destroyed many Minoan settlements . Although the LM IIIA ( late Minoan ) period is characterized by affluence ( wealthy tombs , burials and art ) and ubiquitous Knossian ceramic styles , by LM IIIB Knossos ' wealth and importance as a regional center apparently declined

Andrew Tran of Overmental argued that " the episode ... dissects vividly that bottomless feeling of midlife wanderlust ... not the road-trippy , running-through-the-fields kind but rather the life-map-disappearing-in-your-hands , what-the-hell-is-next kind .

		CONTEXT=The Red Army 's focus on mobile operations in the early 1930s was gravely disrupted by Stalin 's purge of the military 's leadership . Since the new doctrines were associated with officers who had been declared enemies of the state , the support for them declined . Many large mechanised formations were disbanded , with the tanks distributed to support the infantry . After the German blitzkrieg proved its potency in Poland and France , the Red Army started a frantic effort to rebuild the large mechanised corps , but the task was only partly finished when the Wehrmacht attacked in 1941 . The huge tank forces , powerful only on paper , were mostly annihilated by the Germans in the first months of Operation Barbarossa . Another factor contributing to the initial defeat was that the Soviet post-World War I rearmament effort was started too early , and in 1941 the majority of Soviet equipment was obsolete and inferior to that of the Wehrmacht

		CONTEXT=The film was not the official German submission to the 51st Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film . Instead Hans W. Geißendörfer 's '' The Glass Cell '' was chosen to be the official German submission . Almost one year later the film was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 37th Golden Globe Awards , but this success was overshadowed by the success of Volker Schlöndorff 's '' The Tin Drum '' at the 52nd Academy Awards . The commercial success of '' The Marriage of Maria Braun '' strengthened the negotiation position of Fassbinder in his subsequent film projects . He received a financing agreement for one of his favorite projects based on Pitigrilli 's novel '' Cocaine '' and was able to increase the budget for '' Berlin Alexanderplatz '' . Several German commercial film producers expressed an interest in making films with Fassbinder . The seasoned film producer Luggi Waldleitner would produce the Fassbinder film '' Lili Marleen '' with Hanna Schygulla in the main role . Horst Wendlandt would produce the two other films in the BRD Trilogy , '' Lola '' and '' Veronika Voss '' .

		CONTEXT=The film premiered at the Panorama section of the 2019 Berlin International Film Festival . Its official premiere took place at the Zoo Palast , and was presented by Michael Stultz . New Europe Film Sales announced its theatrical release in a series of territories ( Germany , Greece , Poland , Korea , Sweden , etc. ) , and the film continued its festival outings with participations at the 2019 BiFan - Bucheon Fantastic International Film Festival ( Asian premiere ) , the Beaune International Thriller Festival , the Istanbul Film Festival , the Transylvania International Film Festival , etc . After its premiere in Berlinale , the Guardian 's film critic Peter Bradshaw gave the film a 3/5 star review , calling it " A Lynchian psychodrama in the sun " and " a disquieting spectacle of strangeness " . The Hollywood Reporter and Screen International praised the film for its direction , imagery and the committed performances of Angeliki Papoulia and Youla Boudali , while criticising elements of the script 's narrative construction and pace . Guy Lodge in Variety wrote that " “ '' A Blast '' director Syllas Tzoumerkas returns with an agitated , atmospheric and sometimes confounding exercise in modern Greek tragedy . Tzoumerkas ’ latest invites comparisons to the loopier , trash-skirting genre outings of Herzog or Lynch , with the gradual unpeeling of layered madness and corruption in the sleepy working town of Missolonghi occasionally calling to mind an aggressively sunburned '' Twin Peaks '' " . Savina Petkova of the Electric Ghost gave the film 5/5 stars , writing that " while the film is saturated with Biblical quotes , icons of saints , and church choir songs , its form attends equally to the lowly human , animal , and nature . Pacifying all forms of life under the flag of future deliverance , the promise that each being will attain their most perfect form and self , '' The Miracle of the Sargasso Sea '' provides a convergence between religious submission and humanistic agency . ” Victoria Ferguson in the Upcoming gave the film a 3/5 review praising the cinematography by Petrus Sjövik and " its close shots that capture the inner angst of the characters " and calling '' The Miracle of the Sargasso Sea '' visually compelling , and ' a show of great creative ambition from Tzoumerkas . ” Italian critic Massimo Lechi wrote in '' Il Ragazzo Selvaggio '' magazine that “ '' The Miracle of the Sargasso Sea '' , set in the inhospitable surroundings of a sun-parched Missolonghi , is a metaphysical thriller loaded with biblical references , an unsettling and disturbing meditation on the concept of paradise featuring two women in profound existential crisis : Elisabeth , ( a master Angeliki Papoulia ) a disgraced policewoman confined in the province by her superiors following an unfortunate anti-terrorist operation ; and Rita ( the brave Youla Boudali , also co-screenwriter ) , a painful figure of a martyr besieged by visions of a mystical background . Tzoumerkas ’ cinema is one that ’s not afraid of risk or ridicule , one which in fact , has the clear intent of forcing the limits of both the police genre and the auteur film genre , seducing with the skill of its performers and its disquieting aesthetic choices that are never banal . After '' Homeland '' ( 2010 ) and '' A Blast '' ( 2014 ) , '' The Miracle of the Sargasso '' is the third – and more complex – chapter of Tzoumerkas ’ ideal trilogy on contemporary Greece . ” '' The Miracle of the Sargasso Sea '' and Syllas Tzoumerkas were nominated for the Panorama Audience Award and the Teddy Award at the 69th Berlin International Film Festival

" Similarly , Jake Cole of '' Slant Magazine '' praised the acting , but criticized the screenplay , and argued that " so much of the film feels old-hat . " In a review for '' The Verge '' , Tasha Robinson lamented the plot details omitted between the film 's three acts , but wrote that " what does make it to the screen is unforgettable . " While discussing the film after its screening at the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival , Justin Chang of the '' Los Angeles Times '' described '' Moonlight '' as " achingly romantic and uncommonly wise , " opining the film to be an early Oscar contender . Chang further wrote : " Barry Jenkins made a film that urges the viewer to look past Chiron 's outward appearance and his superficial signifiers of identity , climbing inside familiar stereotypes in order to quietly dismantle them from within ... '' Moonlight '' does n't say much . It says everything . " Writing for '' The London Review of Books '' in February 2017 , Michael Wood characterized the film as a study of an inherited intergenerational tragedy : Camilla Long of '' The Times '' wrote that the film 's " story has been told countless times , against countless backdrops " , and that the film is not " relevant " to a predominantly " straight , white , middle class " audience . Long was criticized by users on Twitter for the review , and was accused of being homophobic and racist in her writing . Catherine Shoard defended her by pointing out that " critics ' opinions are subjective , and are supposed to be . " However , David McAlmont referred to Long 's review as " not a review ... but a waspish response to other reviews . " '' Moonlight '' was listed on numerous critics ' top ten lists for 2016

		CONTEXT=Australian '' 60 Minutes '' reporter Richard Carleton sued '' Media Watch '' over allegations of plagiarism . The judge found that the allegations were untrue and declined to award any damages . The ABC World Today reported on 18 December 2002 : " The veteran reporter was horrified to see Media Watch accuse him of plagiarising a BBC documentary on the 1995 massacre at Srebrenica for his Channel Nine program . But today a judge ruled that even though the program did defame Mr Richard Carleton and two colleagues , it was fair comment and no damages were awarded . " This ability to generate controversy led to the temporary cancellation of the show . In 2000 , host Paul Barry was controversially sacked and , in 2001 , the program itself was axed by Jonathan Shier , the head of the ABC . However , in early 2002 , after Shier was himself sacked in similarly controversial circumstances , the show returned with David Marr as the new host . While '' Media Watch '' was off air , former host , Stuart Littlemore , presented a replacement program , '' Littlemore '' , that also examined issues about the media , running for 13 episodes between March and May 2001

As a member of the cast , she was nominated for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Cast in a Motion Picture but won the Hollywood Film Festival Award for Best Ensemble Cast . Hunt made her feature film directorial debut in '' Then She Found Me '' ( 2007 ) , in which she also starred as a 39-year-old Brooklyn elementary school teacher , who after years is contacted by the flamboyant host of a local talk show , played by Bette Midler , who introduces herself as her biological mother . After first reading Elinor Lipman 's novel , she tried to interest numerous studios in the material , and her unsuccessful efforts led her to begin writing the screenplay and raising funds to produce it herself . Upon its release , Ruthe Stein of the '' San Francisco Chronicle '' observed , " You would think that frontloading '' Then She Found Me '' with so much plot would make it play like a soap opera . But Hunt saves the movie from this fate in two ways . First she turns in a touchingly real performance , the best of her big-screen career . Forget that '' As Good as It Gets '' won her an Oscar . She 's eons better and more realistic in this one ... By directing '' Then She Found Me '' , Helen becomes its savior as well ... Hunt knows when to rein in the Divine Miss M instead of allowing her to go into full Kabuki mode . She also coaxes pitch-perfect performances from Broderick and Firth . " Hunt starred in the dramedy '' Every Day '' ( 2010 ) , as one half of a married couple pulled apart by increasing responsibilities . According to '' Los Angeles Times '' , the film " comes as a reminder of Hunt 's talent for understatement , and a wish to see more of her " . In the biographical drama '' Soul Surfer '' ( 2011 ) , she played the mother of the Hawaiian-born champion surfer Bethany Hamilton , on whose life the film was based . Her first wide release since 2001 's '' The Curse of the Jade Scorpion '' , '' Soul Surfer '' made US$ 47.1 million internationally . Hunt starred as sex surrogate Cheryl Cohen-Greene in '' The Sessions '' ( 2012 ) , alongside John Hawkes and William H. Macy . The role required Hunt to perform multiple scenes of full-frontal nudity , on which she further said : " Being naked was challenging , but even more than that was the vulnerability . I felt vulnerable because I was naked . I felt vulnerable because we were having such a vulnerable moment in this character 's life . This was a real journey that someone had gone on , and I wanted to do right by that . " Her performance was acclaimed by critics and earned her several award nominations , including an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress . Todd McCarthy of '' The Hollywood Reporter '' wrote : " Hunt 's performance may be physically bold but is equally marked by its maturity and composure . " Hunt played research geneticist Mary-Claire King in the independent drama '' Decoding Annie Parker '' ( 2013 ) , which was released to a mixed critical response . She wrote and directed the drama '' Ride '' ( 2014 ) , in which she also starred as a mother who travels cross-country to California to be with her son after he decides to drop out of school and become a surfer . Rotten Tomatoes ' critical consensus read : " '' Ride '' reaffirms Helen Hunt 's immense acting talent — but suggests that she still needs time to develop as a director . " In '' The Miracle Season '' ( 2018 ) , based on the true story of the Iowa City West High School volleyball team , Hunt played Kathy Bresnahan , a volleyball coach

" Despite finding filler in the album , '' HipHopDX '' writer Wise Q praised it for continuing the previous album 's formula of great production and wordplay , concluding that , " On the whole , the wild haired lyricist has made a good attempt at a follow-up and although it may not be five star status , it is definitely one for the collection . " Kitty Empire of '' NME '' commented on how Mystikal is able to deviate from the typical hip-hop clichés and deliver tracks that express different topics , singling out the post-9 / 11 track " Bouncin ' Back ( Bumpin ' Me Against the Wall ) " for providing real substance and found it " strangely compelling for a show of strength . " Nathan Rabin of '' The A.V. Club '' found the album more focused and consistent than '' Let 's Get Ready '' because of Mystikal 's production team showing improvement , saying that " '' Tarantula '' suggests that the raspy-voiced rapper 's run at the top of the charts wo n't abate any time soon . " '' Vibe '' writer Shawn Edwards was critical of Mystikal 's delivery , complimenting it for being distinctive but lacking in lyrical creativity , saying that he " has the potential to be the ringmaster , but right now he seems content just clowning around . " In 2003 , the album received two nominations at the 45th Annual Grammy Awards for Best Rap Album and Best Male Rap Solo Performance for " Boucin ' Back ( Bumpin ' Me Against the Wall ) " but lost both awards to Eminem 's '' The Eminem Show '' and Nelly 's " Hot in Herre " respectively . In 2011 , '' Complex '' ranked the album number 43 on its list of " The 50 Worst Rap Album Fails " . '' Complex '' editor Chris Yuscavage called it a let-down compared to his previous album saying , " With all eyes on the rapid-fire spitter , Mystikal seriously dropped the ball with '' Tarantula '' , his phoned-in follow-up that dropped only one year later . Even with reliable collaborators like The Neptunes , Scott Storch , and KLC , every song on the LP felt like a half-baked imitation of his previous work . "

		CONTEXT=The jazz orchestra dancing in Scandinavia was interrupted by the counterculture of the 1960s , whose influences of left-wing politics and LSD were altering the shape of popular music around the world . In 1967 the first psychedelic and progressive rock groups emerged in Stockholm 's Filips club , including Hansson & Karlsson , the Baby Grandmothers , and Mecki Mark Men . These groups were very popular in the Sweden of the late 60s , with television appearances , sold-out concerts , and tours around Europe . Mecki Mark Men even spent three months in the U.S. where they played big rock music festivals with Sly and the Family Stone , Jethro Tull , Pentangle , Mountain , Grand Funk Railroad , Paul Butterfield , and The Byrds . Aside from this music that blended rock , jazz , and folk music with improvisation and experimentation , Swedish progressive rock , or " progg " as it became known , was also fiercely political . Progg bands would go on to support efforts against war and nuclear power , or protest competitive events like Eurovision , stating , " Music can not be a contest . " The term " dansband " was coined around 1970 , when Swedish popular music developed a signature style with brightly characterized lyrics and catchy melodies . The following decade became the golden era of dansband music , with groups like Thorleifs , Flamingokvintetten , Ingmar Nordströms , Wizex and Matz Bladhs rising to popularity in Sweden . In 1977 , the song " Beatles " , performed by Swedish dansband Forbes , won the Swedish Melodifestivalen 1977 and finished 18th ( last ) in the Eurovision Song Contest 1977

But the chorus opens up to turn into something less Police-y and more , dare I say it , Bruno Mars-y . " Kitty Empire of '' The Observer '' wrote that the song " channels the Police , but its 21st-century builds owe as much to rave-pop as they do to producer Mark Ronson .

We ’re making history right here , standing here as Asian-Americans . ” However , shortly after Davuluri was crowned Miss America 2014 , xenophobic and racist comments relating the proximity of the event date to the nine-eleven anniversary and to anti-Indian sentiment appeared in American social media . News agencies cited tweets that misidentified her as Muslim or Arab , associated her with groups such as Al-Qaeda , and questioned why she was chosen over Miss Kansas Theresa Vail . Davuluri said that she was prepared for the social media response because " as Miss New York , I was called a terrorist and very similar remarks . " Davuluri is the second Miss Syracuse to win the title after Miss New York 1983 , Vanessa Lynn Williams who was the first African American winner and Miss America 1984 . Both Davuluri and Williams won when the pageant was held in Atlantic City and both faced a backlash over their respective wins . In addition , Congressperson Grace Meng compared Davuluri to Miss New York 1945 , Bess Myerson ( the first and to date only Jewish-American winner and Miss America 1945 ) who also faced bigotry during her time as Miss America

Later , in September 2014 , Spears posted a picture of herself in the studio , hinting that she was recording new music . In another interview , a month later , she revealed that she was working " very slowly , but progressively " on the album . In 2015 , she released the song " Pretty Girls " with Iggy Azalea , however the song was met with moderate impact and Spears headed back to the studio to record more songs , but did n't have plans to release a new album . In November 2015 , Spears teased on her Instagram account that she was working with songwriters Justin Tranter and Julia Michaels , by posting a picture of them looking " bemused " with the caption : " Working hard and hardly working ... new album ... wheeeee ! . " A month later , Tranter gave an interview for website NewNowNext about his work with Spears and commented : " Working with Britney is a fucking dream . She is so sweet , so inspiring and a master on the mic . Me and Julia had to leave the studio one day because our screams of excitement after every take she did were distracting the producers . " In late 2016 , during interviews to promote the album , Spears declared that she wanted to explore new things on the record , and that it was her " most hip-hop album , " explaining : " ... there are like two or three songs that go in the direction of more urban that I 've wanted to do for a long time now , and I just have n't really done that .

" is an electropop , and dance-pop song that lasts for three minutes and twenty-two seconds ( 3:22 ) . It features " subtle keyboards , a strummed guitar , " and " wobbly bass " in its instrumentation . For Brian Josephs of '' Spin '' , the song 's guitar slaps " recall her 2001 single ' I 'm a Slave 4 U.

Bianca Gracie of '' Fuse '' opined that the song reminded her of " the glory days ( no pun intended ) of ' Circus ' and ' Femme Fatale ' . " Lyrically , " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is a flirty song about Spears " offer ing several reasons why her lover should come over and options , which can be seen in the lines " Nobody should be alone if they do n't have to be " and " I could get into that kissin ' and touchin ' / Or we could be good and do next to nothin ' . " Amy Roberts of '' Bustle '' noted that the lyrics are about hooking up , adding that they " celebrate the idea that casual relationships do n't need to be lacking respect or understanding . You do n't have to be in love with , or committing to , the person that you 're hooking up with , but that also does n't mean that you ca n't connect with them on a different level than just sex . In fact , Spears makes it clear that it 's kind of even cool if her hook-up does n't want to have sex . Her partner can draw the boundaries of where the massage she 's offering starts and ends , and if it remains as nothing more than a back rub then so be it – that 's totally cool . " For Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine , the song features " some dubious lyrics that seem to suggest masturbatory self-love " in the lines : " All I want is what you want/And all you want is me .

		CONTEXT=After the commercial lackluster of her eighth studio album , '' Britney Jean '' ( 2013 ) , Spears started her Las Vegas residency show , Britney : Piece of Me , which attained commercial success . Later , in September 2014 , Spears posted a picture of herself in the studio , hinting that she was recording new music . In another interview , a month later , she revealed that she was working " very slowly , but progressively " on the album . In 2015 , she released the song " Pretty Girls " with Iggy Azalea , however the song was met with moderate impact and Spears headed back to the studio to record more songs , but did n't have plans to release a new album . In November 2015 , Spears teased on her Instagram account that she was working with songwriters Justin Tranter and Julia Michaels , by posting a picture of them looking " bemused " with the caption : " Working hard and hardly working ... new album ... wheeeee ! . " A month later , Tranter gave an interview for website NewNowNext about his work with Spears and commented : " Working with Britney is a fucking dream . She is so sweet , so inspiring and a master on the mic . Me and Julia had to leave the studio one day because our screams of excitement after every take she did were distracting the producers . " In late 2016 , during interviews to promote the album , Spears declared that she wanted to explore new things on the record , and that it was her " most hip-hop album , " explaining : " ... there are like two or three songs that go in the direction of more urban that I 've wanted to do for a long time now , and I just have n't really done that . " In May 2016 , in an exclusive interview for website '' Breathe Heavy '' , Tranter revealed : " Nobody ever talks about Britney as a writer and she ’s f " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " was written by Mattias Larsson , Robin Fredriksson , Julia Michaels , Justin Tranter and Sandy Chila , with production being done by Mattman & Robin . Mattman & Robin were also responsible for programming , drums , percussion , snaps , handclaps , synths , guitars , bass and kalimba , while Michaels and Jermaine Jackson provided background vocals . It was recorded at 158 Studios , Westlake Village , California , The Studio at the Palms , Las Vegas , Nevada , and at Wolf Cousins Studios , Stockholm , Sweden . " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is an electropop , and dance-pop song that lasts for three minutes and twenty-two seconds ( 3:22 ) . It features " subtle keyboards , a strummed guitar , " and " wobbly bass " in its instrumentation . For Brian Josephs of '' Spin '' , the song 's guitar slaps " recall her 2001 single ' I 'm a Slave 4 U. ' " Other critics also felt that the " strummed flamenco guitar " on the song is similar to those on Justin Timberlake 's " Like I Love You " . Bianca Gracie of '' Fuse '' opined that the song reminded her of " the glory days ( no pun intended ) of ' Circus ' and ' Femme Fatale ' . " Lyrically , " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is a flirty song about Spears " offer ing several reasons why her lover should come over and options , which can be seen in the lines " Nobody should be alone if they do n't have to be " and " I could get into that kissin ' and touchin ' / Or we could be good and do next to nothin ' . " Amy Roberts of '' Bustle '' noted that the lyrics are about hooking up , adding that they " celebrate the idea that casual relationships do n't need to be lacking respect or understanding . You do n't have to be in love with , or committing to , the person that you 're hooking up with , but that also does n't mean that you ca n't connect with them on a different level than just sex . In fact , Spears makes it clear that it 's kind of even cool if her hook-up does n't want to have sex . Her partner can draw the boundaries of where the massage she 's offering starts and ends , and if it remains as nothing more than a back rub then so be it – that 's totally cool . " For Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine , the song features " some dubious lyrics that seem to suggest masturbatory self-love " in the lines : " All I want is what you want/And all you want is me . " The chorus of the song features " a shouted gang " of backup singers , singing : " Whatever you want / whatever you need / I 'll do it ! . " Lewis Corner of Digital Spy called it " a thumping pop anthem , " praising " Britney 's seductive vocal delivery . " Gil Kaufman of '' Billboard '' named it a " fun , flirty " track . Bianca Gracie of '' Fuse '' described it as a " pulsating track that is a flirty booty call that is bound to own the dance floor . " Robbie Daw of Idolator found it to be " a traditional Spears-style chunk of dance-pop " and " arguably the best yet , with its thick whomping bass and that sparkling ' nobody should be alone if they do n't have to be ' breakdown . " Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine called it " impeccably produced downstairs music , " adding that it " is an irresistible slice of dance-pop , with an ebullient bassline and staccato acoustic guitar . " Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic declared that " some of the highlights on the album are the silliest songs , " citing " Do You Wan na Come Over " 's " overheated flamenco chorus " as an example . Maura Johnston of '' Boston Globe '' said the song was one of the album 's high points , noting that the song " is jolted to life by the slashed guitars that helped make ' Toxic ' a pop thrill . " John Murphy of musicOMH was positive while noting that the track " has a rush and urgency about it which marks it out as one of the album 's best songs . " Nolan Feeney of '' Entertainment Weekly '' also picked it as a highlight , praising the " acoustic guitars and gurgling bass lines that make for one freaky pop experiment . " Alex Macpherson of '' The Guardian '' wrote that the song " takes the party back to Britney 's heyday , " praising the inclusion of the flamenco guitar . For '' Los Angeles Times '' writer Mikael Wood , the song " restore s some of the sonic invention that once defined Spears ' biggest hits . " Nick Levine , writing for '' NME '' , echoed the same thought , writing : " The lusty strut of ‘ Do You Wan na Come Over ? ’ nods to her early-noughties Neptunes-produced hits . " In his Vice column , Robert Christgau selected " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " and " Clumsy " as his favorite tracks on the album . Amy Mackelden of '' Bustle '' elaborated about the track : With a strong '90s vibe , an upbeat tempo , and a surprising rhythm , " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " utilizes the best of Spears ' talents . ... " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " embraces the current trend for songs that are musically complicated , that layer up their beats and sound effects , and feature multiple voices and infectious shouting during their choruses . Much like Hailee Steinfeld and Gwen Stefani 's latest offerings , " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is melodic , has a fast tempo , and is instantly recognizable . And most importantly , it 's fun . On August 18 , 2016 , Spears added " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " , as well as " Make Me ... " , to the setlist of her Las Vegas residency show Britney : Piece of Me . Later , on September 1 , 2016 , a performance of the song was broadcast from Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas for Today . During the performance , she used " an outfit similar to her risqué costume from 2016 's VMAs , while her backup dancers stood out in brightly-colored tank tops and shorts , " as reported by '' Entertainment Weekly '' Ruth Kinane . The song was also included in Spears 's setlist for the iHeartRadio Music Festival on September 24 , 2016 . Spears also performed it at I Heart Radio Jingle Ball , Triple Show and B26 Pepsi Jingle Bash during December 2016 . Also performed it at Apple Music Festival which was held in United Kingdom

Dredged from the bed of the Tiber in Rome , in making piers for the Ponte Garibaldi ( 1885 , bridge completed 1888 ) , it is conserved in the Museo Nazionale Romano in Palazzo Massimo alle Terme , Rome . The style of the sculpture reflects the school of Phidias , perhaps the young Phidias himself , as Jiří Frel suggested , and Kenneth Clark observed of it , " If only this figure , instead of the Apollo Belvedere , had been known to Winckelmann , his insight and beautiful gift of literary re-creation would have been better supported by the sculptural qualities of his subject .

" '' See also '' : Religion of Peace He stressed that " bin Laden is serious about mass murder " and wants to " impose ... totalitarian control throughout the Middle East , and arm al Qaeda with weapons of mass murder . Their aim is to seize power in Iraq , and use it as a safe haven ... When they murder children at a school in Beslan , or blow up commuters in London , or behead a bound captive , the terrorists hope these horrors will break our will . " He indirectly referenced the Beatitudes by saying the terrorists hope that breaking the will of the U.S. will allow " the violent to inherit the Earth . " In a verbal attack on " isolationist " and " appeasing " sentiments , Bush condemned " the false comfort of isolationism " for sending the " signal to all that we no longer believe in our own ideals , or even in our own courage . " Bush stated that America is addicted to oil often originating from unstable parts of the world . He announced increased funding in clean-energy research : renewable energy , for instance biofuels and nuclear energy .

		GOLD_MENTION=Montreal massacre
		CONTEXT=Adam Thrasher argued that the " Take Back the Night " marches cause polarization in gender relations , since women discourage men from participating . Thrasher said , as paraphrased by Dan Lazin of '' The Gateway '' , that " unthinking men may be incited to further hatred towards women . " Thrasher argued that while the strips criticize " the ideas of some hard-core feminists , " they are not against all women . Thrasher added that " The reason I did it is because it 's such a taboo to make fun of violence against women , against Take Back the Night . " Thrasher also stated that " When I drew up the cartoon , I was n't thinking about Marc Lepine and the Montreal massacre which was a crime against humanity , I think , more than a crime against women . " A Saturday October 25 , 1997 , editorial of '' The Globe and Mail '' argued that the actions against Thrasher were censorship and that " the instinct to block the juvenile humour was more disturbing than the juvenalia itself . " The '' Alberta Report '' said in 1997 that " '' Space Moose '' is a festival of caricatured scatology , violence , perversion , irreligion and even pedophilia . It has stimulated outrage before , but in five years the university had never suppressed the strip , despite lampoons of University institutions , Trekkies , the mentally retarded , and Christians . Only one group , it seems , has the clout to make the university turn censor . " In response to Thrasher 's argument that the marches could polarize gender relations and that the comic had a different message than perceived , Gretchen Hess said that the intent of the strip was not easily discernible and that the effect of the strip should be considered in addition to the intent . Linda Trimble argued that " t he pretty direct message of the cartoon was ' It 's open season on feminists . Kill all the women . " Joyce Green , a University of Regina political science professor who was another complainant , argued that " I do n't see any difference between the Montreal Massacre and the cartoon . " Green added that the group had complained about the strips " not because we 're paranoid but because we 're terrified . " Shannon Sampert , a political science student who was another one of the complainants , said that she was not surprised that the appeal went in favor of Thrasher . She believed that additional students would try to take the course of action that Thrasher took , and she believed that Feminists would cause an outcry against the appeals

		CONTEXT=On 16 June 1979 , the Muslim Brotherhood carried out an attack on cadets at the Aleppo Artillery School , officially killing 83 . Around this time , professor Yusef al-Yusef was assassinated in Aleppo , an event often cited by secular activist Wafa Sultan as the reason she came to oppose Islam in general . The Syrian government responded by sentencing to death about 15 prisoners , already accused of being Iraqi agents , for belonging to the Islamic resistance movement . Terrorist attacks then became a daily occurrence , particularly in Aleppo and other northern cities . The government tended to ascribe these attacks to the Brotherhood , but as the armed resistance gained widespread popular support and more loosely defined armed groups appeared , especially in poor neighborhoods , it became difficult to determine the extent of the Brotherhood 's involvement

Two adults and a child were shot to death , 4 other children were drowned whose ages ranged from 9 days to 10 years old . Two others were severely injured . Four men from the Nation of Islam Mosque No. 12 were accused of the crime . After the 1973 murders , " The azaleas were cut down and cleared away . Hedges , shrubbery , anything that might hide an intruder - were leveled until a bare expanse of gravel had replaced the garden . The windows were barred ; a spotlight shone on the front steps . And Hanafi guards , armed with machetes and long Japanese swords , began a night-and-day vigil outside the Khaalis house . Every time a neighbor passed the Hanafi house the guards were there , pacing , walking steadily down the gravel field and back again . In winter they put on overcoats and warm hats and kept pacing . It made many neighbors uneasy . " Newsday described the conversion of the " large brick and fieldstone Tudor house " into a " fortress ; " basement windows had been bricked over and iron bars sealed other windows . Khaalis 's son-in-law , Abdul Aziz , boasted about the explosives inside to a reporter , claiming that " If people want to storm this house , that 's it for the house . " Aziz asserted that " This is a Holy War in the sense that Allah tells you through the Koran ... it seeks vengeance . " Khaalis ' goal in attacking and taking hostages at Washington , D.C. 's John A. Wilson City Hall , the national B'nai B'rith headquarters , and the Islamic Center of Washington was to force the federal government to turn custody of the five black Muslims convicted in the 1973 murders at 7700 16th St. over to him for purposes of exacting revenge . He had been " stockpiling " weapons in the house on 16th street as he planned the attack

		CONTEXT=Crispi was replaced as prime minister by Antonio Di Rudinì in February 1891 , who was succeeded by Giovanni Giolitti in May 1892 . On January 20 , 1893 , when peasants of Caltavuturo occupied communal land that they claimed was theirs , local authorities killed 13 and wounded 21 in the Caltavuturo massacre . Disturbances continued throughout the year . The Fasci started out as urban movements , animated by artisans , which evolved into a more popular and combative mass movement with the adherence of sulphur miners , and in a later stage with the involvement of peasants and sharecroppers . In the autumn of 1893 , labour conflicts in the cities and the mines came together with the protests and claims of the farmers . The movement reached its greatest breadth in the manifestations against taxes , involving the lowest tiers of the city and the countryside , becoming difficult , if not impossible , to control by its leaders

		CONTEXT=From 18 – 20 May 1944 he was permitted to take a three-day vacation from combat to visit his family in Alupka , not long after the Soviets retook control of Crimea . During the visit , he witnessed the deportation of his people and learned his brother Imran was wanted by the NKVD . While he had been risking life and limb to expel German invaders from Crimea , Imran had been suspected of joining the German auxiliary police . After the Soviets retook Crimea , Imran was tried and sentenced by a military tribunal in 1946 for his activities as a guard at a concentration camp . Leaflets describing the feats of Amet-khan Sultan against the Germans had been airdropped over Crimea while it was occupied by the Germans , resulting in the Gestapo finding the leaflets and tracking down his parents for execution . The only thing that saved his parents from being murdered by the Gestapo was Imran 's presence in the Schutzmannschaft . During the deportation an NKVD officer who entered the household attempted to force Amet-khan and his parents to leave Crimea , but they fought and a struggle ensued ; after Amet-khan identified himself as a Hero of the Soviet Union to the NKVD officer who had attacked him , and his status as a war hero was confirmed by Hero of the Soviet Union , Pavel Golovachev who was present at the scene . The NKVD officer began questioning him about his ethnic background , decided that Amet-khan was technically Dagestani , and said that there was an order to deport the Crimean Tatar people . The NKVD continued to deport the Crimean Tatar people , and his mother , who was a Tatar , was sent to a transportation point , but after other members of the Air Force who were friends of Amet-khan made it clear to the NKVD that she and the rest of her immediate family were exempt from deportation because she was married to a Lak and hence no longer considered a Crimean Tatar in the eyes of the law , she and her husband were not sent to Uzbekistan ; Imran was sentenced in 1946 but the rest of Amet-khan 's immediate family was not subject to the collective punishment of the deportation in its entirety . They still had to leave Crimea for the remainder of the war , but they were given more time to pack and drove to Dagestan instead of Uzbekistan

		CONTEXT=The first feature film Ján Kadár and Elmar Klos were able to make in five years showed a decided return to classical black-and-white filmmaking with barely a trace of Kadár 's more experimental work at the '' Laterna magika '' . A gradual relaxation of communist control in Czechoslovakia , whose first signs came from Slovakia , enabled the Bratislava journalist and writer Ladislav Mňačko to publish his novel '' Death Is Called Engelchen '' ( '' Smrť sa volá Engelchen '' , 1959 ) and Kadár and Klos to reach for it from Prague after their suspension was over . The novel and their film '' Death is Called Engelchen '' ( , , 1963 ) spotlighted a new take on the massive pro-democratic Slovak revolt of 1944 that had previously been portrayed only as invariably glorious . It showed some of its aspects that brought about human tragedy . The film was entered into the 3rd Moscow International Film Festival where it won a Golden Prize . The directors ' next film , '' Accused '' aka '' Defendant '' ( '' Obžalovaný '' , 1964 ) , rehashed the propagandist structures of the earlier Socialist-Realist filmmaking , but turned them around by replacing the content mandated in the 1950s with committed social criticism that was quickly becoming one of the hallmarks of Slovak and Czech cinema of the 1960s

		CONTEXT=The episode was watched by a total of 3.77 million viewers , making it , at that point , the lowest-watched episode of the show . In part , this was due to pre-emption by the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting memorial service , which aired live on most of the East Coast markets . The show still managed to be Fox 's most watched show of the night . That night 's new episodes of '' Family Guy '' and '' American Dad ! '' episodes ( " Jesus , Mary and Joseph ! " and " Minstrel Krampus " ) were preempted and replaced with reruns of their respective shows ( " Grumpy Old Man " and " Wheels and the Legman in : ' The Case of Grampa 's Key ' " ) . Fox decided to repeat " To Cur with Love " in the regular timeslot one week later replacing a repeat , while also putting the pre-empted episode of '' Family Guy '' and a new episode of '' American Dad ! '' entitled " National Treasure 4 : Baby Franny : She 's Doing Well : The Hole Story " , unrelated to " Minstrel Krampus " , on the air . The repeat was watched by 4.89 million viewers with a 2.1 rating in the 18-49 demographic . This made it the 3rd most watched show in the Animation Domination line up that night , losing out to '' Family Guy '' and a repeat of " Gone Abie Gone "

		CONTEXT=The show received a mixed reception from media publications . On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes , the show holds an approval rating of 43 % based on 30 critics , and summarized , " The 90th Academy Awards played it safe and hit no major snags -- but by clocking in at over four hours , returning host Jimmy Kimmel and company wore out their welcome long before the surprise ending . " Hank Stuever of '' The Washington Post '' marked , " In his second year , Kimmel has shown that the telecast need n't be anything but sharp and sure , with a funny host whose bits are manageable , shareable and – best of all – forgotten . We 're not making showbiz history here ; we 're just trying to get through another Oscar night . " Chief critic David Edelstein of '' Vulture '' wrote , " This was the best , most inspiring , and most sheerly likable Academy Awards telecast I 've ever seen . ... It was also – in terms of the actual awards – among the most disappointing . " '' Vanity Fair '' s , Richard Lawson wrote , " As a host , Kimmel struck a careful , appropriately measured tone ... All told , Sunday 's ceremony did an admirable job of recognizing all the turmoil surrounding it while maintaining the silly , chintzy trappings that so many of us tune into the Oscars for . " CNN 's Brian Lowry quipped , " The Oscars are a big , unwieldy beast , which invariably try to serve too many masters . Yet if the intent was ultimately to maintain a celebratory tone without ignoring either the outside world or the elephant in the room throughout this year 's awards , host Jimmy Kimmel and the show itself largely succeeded . " Others were more critical of the show . Television critic Maureen Ryan of '' Variety '' said , " All things considered , the show had a more or less low-key vibe . Normally it takes about two hours for the numbing effect to set in , but despite host Jimmy Kimmel 's best efforts , Sunday 's telecast started to feel a bit languid and low-energy far earlier . " Television critic James Poniewozik of '' The New York Times '' said , " despite the recent upheaval in Hollywood , the ceremony at large still focused mainly on celebration and glitter literally , in the case of the blinding set , which looked as if the ceremony were encased in an enormous geode . There 's also the perennial problem of bloat . The hitch , of course , is that every part of the show has its constituency . " Darren Franich of '' Entertainment Weekly '' wrote , " What fun we had at this year 's Oscars ! Long show , sure , but where to cut it ? " Writing for '' Deadline '' Greg Evans said , " Did the nearly four-hour running time contain any moments for the Oscar ages ? Probably not . " David Wiegand of the '' San Francisco Chronicle '' wrote , " Even the hope that the noise of clapping might keep the audience at home and in the theater awake , there was little of that for anything except the entrance of actors of advance age . " '' The Oregonian '' columnist Kristi Turnquist wrote , " Was it respectful ? Absolutely . Did it make for kind of a dull , earnest Oscars show ? Yeah , kind of . " Attaining 26.5 million U.S. viewers according to Nielsen ratings , the ceremony 's telecast had a 16-percent drop in viewership from last year 's ceremony and had the lowest U.S. viewership in Oscar history . On March 6 , after the final ratings were confirmed , President Donald Trump took to his Twitter account , saying , " Lowest rated Oscars in HISTORY . Problem is , we do n't have stars anymore – except your President ( just kidding , of course ) ! " . In response , Kimmel also tweeted , saying , " Thanks , lowest rated President in HISTORY . " In July 2018 , the ceremony presentation received eight nominations for the 70th Primetime Creative Arts Emmys

		CONTEXT=The ceremony was held on a night other than Sunday for the first time since 1976 ( the 28th Primetime Emmy Awards were also staged on a Monday that year , May 17 ) . The ceremony 's unusual date — a Monday night in late August — was due to two factors , primary being NBC 's commitment to '' Sunday Night Football '' ; since acquiring the National Football League 's Sunday night game package in 2006 , NBC , when it is their turn in the four-network rotation to air the Primetime Emmy Awards , usually schedules the ceremony for the Sunday before Labor Day weekend , to avoid conflicts with '' SNF '' in mid-September ( when ABC , CBS , or Fox normally air the ceremony ) . NBC 's ideal date on the 2014 calendar for the ceremony ( Sunday , August 24 ) led to the other scheduling factor — MTV 's Video Music Awards , which were set for that night more than a year in advance ( and would be staged in the L.A. area as well , at The Forum in Inglewood ) . On January 28 , 2014 , rather than go head-to-head with the VMA 's , NBC announced that the ceremony would take place on Monday , August 25 .

		CONTEXT=The first official Republican convention in Illinois was held on May 29 , 1856 , in Bloomington . Chairman John M. Palmer was elected convention president after his opening address . Nine vice presidents and five secretaries were then elected . The convention nominated Bissell for governor with Francis Hoffmann as lieutenant governor , Ozias M. Hatch for secretary of state , Jesse K. Dubois as auditor , and James Miller as treasurer . Hoffmann was found to be ineligible for his position due to a residency requirement , and John Wood was nominated in his place . The following resolutions defining the party platform were approved : Resolved , That foregoing all former differences of opinions upon other questions , we pledge ourselves to unite in opposition to the present administration and to the party which upholds and supports it and to use all honorable and constitutional means to wrest the Government from the unworthy hands which now control it and to bring it back in its administration to the principles and practices of Washington , Jefferson and their great and good compatriots of the Revolution . Resolved , That foregoing all former differences of opinions upon other questions , we pledge ourselves to unite in opposition to the present administration of the Government ; that under the Constitution Congress possesses the power to prohibit slavery in the Territories ; and that , whilst we will maintain all constitutional rights of the South , we also hold that justice , humanity , the principles of freedom as expressed in our Declaration of Independence and our national constitution , and the purity and perpetuity of our Government require that that power shall be exerted to prevent the extension of slavery into territory heretofore free . Resolved , That the repeal of the Missouri Compromise was unwise and injurious ; an open and aggravated violation of the plighted faith of the States , and that the attempt of the present administration to force slavery into Kansas against the known wishes of the legal voters of that Territory is an arbitrary and tyrannous violation of the rights of the people to govern themselves , and that we will strive by all constitutional means to secure to Kansas and Nebraska the legal guaranty against slavery of which they were deprived at the cost of the violation of the plighted faith of the nation . Resolved , That we are devoted to the Union and will , to the last extremity , defend it against the efforts now being made by the dis-unionists of this administration to compass its dissolution , and that we will support the Constitution of the United States , in all its provisions regarding it , as the sacred bond of our Union and the only safeguard for the preservation of the rights of ourselves and our posterity . Resolved , That we are in favor of the immediate admission of Kansas as a member of this Confederacy under the constitution adopted by the people of said Territory . Resolved , That the spirit of our institutions as well as the Constitution of our country , guarantees the liberty of conscience as well as political freedom , and that we will proscribe no one by legislation or otherwise on account of religious opinions , or in consequence of place of birth . Lincoln delivered the closing address . The speech was purportedly so captivating that no reporter made a record of it . The address has become known as Lincoln 's Lost Speech . The delegates to the convention were : The Democrats had nominated Richardson for governor at their convention earlier that month . The remnants of the Whig party declined to run a candidate . The first Republican National Convention met that June , nominating John C. Fremont for president . Fremont was defeated handily in his bid for president , including in Illinois , but the Republican state ticket in Illinois was successful . Bissell became the first Governor from a party other than the Democrats since 1838 . Republicans would win every subsequent gubernatorial election through 1893

		GOLD_MENTION=Republican Presidential nomination
		CONTEXT=While the early scenes of Lincoln 's life are remarkably accurate , much of the later scenes contain historical inaccuracies . The famous Lincoln-Douglas debates , in addition to the historically accurate topic of the extension of slavery , have been turned into an argument about secession . Lincoln was famously an underdog for the Republican Presidential nomination in 1860 ; in the film it is suggested he is the sole nominee as a result of the Lincoln-Douglas debates . The outbreak of the Civil War seems to be the Union firing on Charleston , South Carolina from Fort Sumter , rather than the other way around . Also , early in hostilities , General Winfield Scott is depicted as being overconfident of a quick victory ( and something of a buffoon ) , when in reality he was one of the voices in the minority claiming the war would be long , costly , and bloody . Lincoln receives a report from the Secret Service that some copperheads in the North have issued threats against him . The Secret Service was not created until two months after Lincoln 's death . Finally , in the climax of the film , Lincoln delivers a conflation of famous words from the Gettysburg Address and Second Inaugural Address at Ford 's Theatre on April 14 , 1865 – just moments before being assassinated . This was Griffith 's second portrayal of Lincoln 's assassination , the first being in '' The Birth of a Nation ''

		GOLD_MENTION=1835 Democratic National Convention
		CONTEXT=In the aftermath of the battle over the national bank , Jackson 's political opponents coalesced into the Whig Party . By taking a name rooted in American and British history , the Whigs implicitly criticized Jackson as a tyrannical executive . Although National Republicans like Clay and Webster formed the core of the Whig Party , Anti-Masonic leaders like William H. Seward and states ' rights Democrats like John Tyler also joined the new party . The Whig Party proved more durable than the National Republican Party and , along with the Democrats , the Whigs became one of the two major parties of the Second Party System , which would extend into the 1850s . By 1834 , Webster supporters such as Caleb Cushing , Rufus Choate , Abbott Lawrence , and Edward Everett had begun preparing for his candidacy in the 1836 presidential election . With Clay showing no indication of making another run , Webster hoped to become the main Whig candidate in the 1836 election , but General William Henry Harrison and Senator Hugh Lawson White retained strong support in the West and the South , respectively . Rather than uniting behind one presidential candidate , Whig leaders settled on a strategy of running multiple candidates in order to force a contingent election in the House of Representatives . Webster was nominated for president by the Massachusetts legislature , but Harrison won the backing of most Whigs outside of the South . Although Webster had a far greater reputation as a national figure than Harrison , many Whigs hoped that Harrison 's military record would allow him to replicate Jackson 's 1832 victory . Webster 's chances also suffered from his lingering association with the Federalist Party , his close relationship with elite politicians and businessmen , and his lack of appeal among the broad populace ; Remini writes that the American public " admired and revered him but did not love or trust him . " With little support outside of his home state , Webster attempted to withdraw his presidential candidacy , but , to his eventual regret , Massachusetts Whig leaders convinced him to stay in the race . Meanwhile , the 1835 Democratic National Convention nominated Van Buren , Jackson 's preferred successor , for president . In the 1836 election , Van Buren won a majority of the popular and electoral vote , Harrison finished a distant second , and White carried two Southern states . Webster won only the electoral votes of Massachusetts . Adding to his displeasure , Webster lost a major Supreme Court decision , '' Charles River Bridge v. Warren Bridge '' , shortly after the election

		CONTEXT=During the 1840s , Bowser painted banners for a diverse range of clients , including the Know Nothing Party , and received a commission to paint the portrait of prominent abolitionist and real estate developer Jacob C. White . Active in that decade 's efforts to repeal the clause in Pennsylvania 's Constitution which prohibited blacks from voting , Bowser and his family also became so involved with the abolition movement that their home became a stop on the Underground Railroad . In 1858 , politics and advocacy merged with art when Bower painted the portrait of abolitionist John Brown while Brown was visiting the Bowser home . During this same period , Bowser also completed work on his painting , '' The Firebell in the Night '' . In addition , he was also active , during this phase of his life , with the Grand United Order of Odd Fellows . As Grand Master of the Order in Philadelphia , he delivered the keynote address at the Annual Moveable Committee of the G.U.O. of O.F. in Toronto , Canada on October 17 , 1859 as its members celebrated the organization 's thirteenth anniversary . According to news reports , he was " listened to throughout with much attention , and was frequently rapturously applauded " as he " defined in eloquent terms the nature of the work of Odd Fellows — especially that great and leading principle , Charity , " and " remarked upon the practical good effected by Odd Fellowship , in alleviating distress and bestowing many of the comforts of life upon the aged and infirm of the Order , as well as conferring benefactions upon the widow and orphan . " Bowser 's work on the first banner was paid for through a commission awarded by the Contraband Relief Association ( CRA ) , an organization headed by Elizabeth Keckley , the formerly enslaved woman who became Mary Todd Lincoln 's dressmaker . It was then presented by the CRA to the leaders of 1st United States Colored Infantry . With respect to the other Bowser-designed battle flags , historians at the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission note that : " The 127th and 3rd regiments marched carrying banners reading ' We will prove ourselves men ' and ' Rather Die Freemen , Than Live To Be Slaves . ' Beneath these , black soldiers protect white women representing Columbia , the symbol of the republic . The 45th 's banner , proclaiming ' One Cause , One Country , ' shows a black soldier proudly holding an American flag in front of a bust of George Washington as black troops fight in the background . The 24th 's banner shows a black soldier ascending a hill , his arms outstretched in prayer , beneath the words ' Let Soldiers in War , Be Citizens in Peace . ' " For the 22nd USCT banner , Bowser depicted a black soldier pointing " a bayonet at the chest of a Confederate who has allowed his flag to fall and who is tossing aside his sword , " beneath the words , " Sic semper tyrannis " ( " thus always to tyrants " ) , a phrase which would come to have an entirely different meaning two years later when shouted by John Wilkes Booth after his assassination of Lincoln at Ford 's Theater

		GOLD_MENTION=1835 Democratic National Convention
		CONTEXT=In the aftermath of the battle over the national bank , Jackson 's political opponents coalesced into the Whig Party . By taking a name rooted in American and British history , the Whigs implicitly criticized Jackson as a tyrannical executive . Although National Republicans like Clay and Webster formed the core of the Whig Party , Anti-Masonic leaders like William H. Seward and states ' rights Democrats like John Tyler also joined the new party . The Whig Party proved more durable than the National Republican Party and , along with the Democrats , the Whigs became one of the two major parties of the Second Party System , which would extend into the 1850s . By 1834 , Webster supporters such as Caleb Cushing , Rufus Choate , Abbott Lawrence , and Edward Everett had begun preparing for his candidacy in the 1836 presidential election . With Clay showing no indication of making another run , Webster hoped to become the main Whig candidate in the 1836 election , but General William Henry Harrison and Senator Hugh Lawson White retained strong support in the West and the South , respectively . Rather than uniting behind one presidential candidate , Whig leaders settled on a strategy of running multiple candidates in order to force a contingent election in the House of Representatives . Webster was nominated for president by the Massachusetts legislature , but Harrison won the backing of most Whigs outside of the South . Although Webster had a far greater reputation as a national figure than Harrison , many Whigs hoped that Harrison 's military record would allow him to replicate Jackson 's 1832 victory . Webster 's chances also suffered from his lingering association with the Federalist Party , his close relationship with elite politicians and businessmen , and his lack of appeal among the broad populace ; Remini writes that the American public " admired and revered him but did not love or trust him . " With little support outside of his home state , Webster attempted to withdraw his presidential candidacy , but , to his eventual regret , Massachusetts Whig leaders convinced him to stay in the race . Meanwhile , the 1835 Democratic National Convention nominated Van Buren , Jackson 's preferred successor , for president . In the 1836 election , Van Buren won a majority of the popular and electoral vote , Harrison finished a distant second , and White carried two Southern states . Webster won only the electoral votes of Massachusetts . Adding to his displeasure , Webster lost a major Supreme Court decision , '' Charles River Bridge v. Warren Bridge '' , shortly after the election

		CONTEXT=While the early scenes of Lincoln 's life are remarkably accurate , much of the later scenes contain historical inaccuracies . The famous Lincoln-Douglas debates , in addition to the historically accurate topic of the extension of slavery , have been turned into an argument about secession . Lincoln was famously an underdog for the Republican Presidential nomination in 1860 ; in the film it is suggested he is the sole nominee as a result of the Lincoln-Douglas debates . The outbreak of the Civil War seems to be the Union firing on Charleston , South Carolina from Fort Sumter , rather than the other way around . Also , early in hostilities , General Winfield Scott is depicted as being overconfident of a quick victory ( and something of a buffoon ) , when in reality he was one of the voices in the minority claiming the war would be long , costly , and bloody . Lincoln receives a report from the Secret Service that some copperheads in the North have issued threats against him . The Secret Service was not created until two months after Lincoln 's death . Finally , in the climax of the film , Lincoln delivers a conflation of famous words from the Gettysburg Address and Second Inaugural Address at Ford 's Theatre on April 14 , 1865 – just moments before being assassinated . This was Griffith 's second portrayal of Lincoln 's assassination , the first being in '' The Birth of a Nation ''

		CONTEXT=The first official Republican convention in Illinois was held on May 29 , 1856 , in Bloomington . Chairman John M. Palmer was elected convention president after his opening address . Nine vice presidents and five secretaries were then elected . The convention nominated Bissell for governor with Francis Hoffmann as lieutenant governor , Ozias M. Hatch for secretary of state , Jesse K. Dubois as auditor , and James Miller as treasurer . Hoffmann was found to be ineligible for his position due to a residency requirement , and John Wood was nominated in his place . The following resolutions defining the party platform were approved : Resolved , That foregoing all former differences of opinions upon other questions , we pledge ourselves to unite in opposition to the present administration and to the party which upholds and supports it and to use all honorable and constitutional means to wrest the Government from the unworthy hands which now control it and to bring it back in its administration to the principles and practices of Washington , Jefferson and their great and good compatriots of the Revolution . Resolved , That foregoing all former differences of opinions upon other questions , we pledge ourselves to unite in opposition to the present administration of the Government ; that under the Constitution Congress possesses the power to prohibit slavery in the Territories ; and that , whilst we will maintain all constitutional rights of the South , we also hold that justice , humanity , the principles of freedom as expressed in our Declaration of Independence and our national constitution , and the purity and perpetuity of our Government require that that power shall be exerted to prevent the extension of slavery into territory heretofore free . Resolved , That the repeal of the Missouri Compromise was unwise and injurious ; an open and aggravated violation of the plighted faith of the States , and that the attempt of the present administration to force slavery into Kansas against the known wishes of the legal voters of that Territory is an arbitrary and tyrannous violation of the rights of the people to govern themselves , and that we will strive by all constitutional means to secure to Kansas and Nebraska the legal guaranty against slavery of which they were deprived at the cost of the violation of the plighted faith of the nation . Resolved , That we are devoted to the Union and will , to the last extremity , defend it against the efforts now being made by the dis-unionists of this administration to compass its dissolution , and that we will support the Constitution of the United States , in all its provisions regarding it , as the sacred bond of our Union and the only safeguard for the preservation of the rights of ourselves and our posterity . Resolved , That we are in favor of the immediate admission of Kansas as a member of this Confederacy under the constitution adopted by the people of said Territory . Resolved , That the spirit of our institutions as well as the Constitution of our country , guarantees the liberty of conscience as well as political freedom , and that we will proscribe no one by legislation or otherwise on account of religious opinions , or in consequence of place of birth . Lincoln delivered the closing address . The speech was purportedly so captivating that no reporter made a record of it . The address has become known as Lincoln 's Lost Speech . The delegates to the convention were : The Democrats had nominated Richardson for governor at their convention earlier that month . The remnants of the Whig party declined to run a candidate . The first Republican National Convention met that June , nominating John C. Fremont for president . Fremont was defeated handily in his bid for president , including in Illinois , but the Republican state ticket in Illinois was successful .

		CONTEXT=In the aftermath of the battle over the national bank , Jackson 's political opponents coalesced into the Whig Party . By taking a name rooted in American and British history , the Whigs implicitly criticized Jackson as a tyrannical executive . Although National Republicans like Clay and Webster formed the core of the Whig Party , Anti-Masonic leaders like William H. Seward and states ' rights Democrats like John Tyler also joined the new party . The Whig Party proved more durable than the National Republican Party and , along with the Democrats , the Whigs became one of the two major parties of the Second Party System , which would extend into the 1850s . By 1834 , Webster supporters such as Caleb Cushing , Rufus Choate , Abbott Lawrence , and Edward Everett had begun preparing for his candidacy in the 1836 presidential election . With Clay showing no indication of making another run , Webster hoped to become the main Whig candidate in the 1836 election , but General William Henry Harrison and Senator Hugh Lawson White retained strong support in the West and the South , respectively . Rather than uniting behind one presidential candidate , Whig leaders settled on a strategy of running multiple candidates in order to force a contingent election in the House of Representatives . Webster was nominated for president by the Massachusetts legislature , but Harrison won the backing of most Whigs outside of the South . Although Webster had a far greater reputation as a national figure than Harrison , many Whigs hoped that Harrison 's military record would allow him to replicate Jackson 's 1832 victory . Webster 's chances also suffered from his lingering association with the Federalist Party , his close relationship with elite politicians and businessmen , and his lack of appeal among the broad populace ; Remini writes that the American public " admired and revered him but did not love or trust him . " With little support outside of his home state , Webster attempted to withdraw his presidential candidacy , but , to his eventual regret , Massachusetts Whig leaders convinced him to stay in the race . Meanwhile , the 1835 Democratic National Convention nominated Van Buren , Jackson 's preferred successor , for president . In the 1836 election , Van Buren won a majority of the popular and electoral vote , Harrison finished a distant second , and White carried two Southern states . Webster won only the electoral votes of Massachusetts . Adding to his displeasure , Webster lost a major Supreme Court decision , '' Charles River Bridge v. Warren Bridge '' , shortly after the election

		CONTEXT=Prior to and during the Civil War , Pennsylvania was a divided state . Although Pennsylvania had outlawed slavery , many conservative Pennsylvanians believed that the federal government should not interfere with the institution of slavery . One such individual was Democrat James Buchanan , the last pre-Civil War president . Buchanan 's party had generally won presidential and gubernatorial elections in Pennsylvania . However , the nascent Republican Party 's first convention took place in Philadelphia , and the 1860 elections saw the Republican Party win the state 's presidential vote and the governor 's office . After the failure of the Crittenden Compromise , the secession of the South , and the Battle of Fort Sumter , the Civil War began with Pennsylvania as a key member of the Union . Despite the Republican victory the 1860 election , Democrats remained powerful in the state , and several " copperheads " called for peace during the war . The Democrats re-took control of the state legislature in the 1862 election , but incumbent Republican Governor Andrew Curtin retained control of the governorship in 1863 . In the 1864 election , President Lincoln narrowly defeated Pennsylvania native George B. McClellan for the state 's electoral votes

		CONTEXT=The first official Republican convention in Illinois was held on May 29 , 1856 , in Bloomington . Chairman John M. Palmer was elected convention president after his opening address . Nine vice presidents and five secretaries were then elected . The convention nominated Bissell for governor with Francis Hoffmann as lieutenant governor , Ozias M. Hatch for secretary of state , Jesse K. Dubois as auditor , and James Miller as treasurer . Hoffmann was found to be ineligible for his position due to a residency requirement , and John Wood was nominated in his place . The following resolutions defining the party platform were approved : Resolved , That foregoing all former differences of opinions upon other questions , we pledge ourselves to unite in opposition to the present administration and to the party which upholds and supports it and to use all honorable and constitutional means to wrest the Government from the unworthy hands which now control it and to bring it back in its administration to the principles and practices of Washington , Jefferson and their great and good compatriots of the Revolution . Resolved , That foregoing all former differences of opinions upon other questions , we pledge ourselves to unite in opposition to the present administration of the Government ; that under the Constitution Congress possesses the power to prohibit slavery in the Territories ; and that , whilst we will maintain all constitutional rights of the South , we also hold that justice , humanity , the principles of freedom as expressed in our Declaration of Independence and our national constitution , and the purity and perpetuity of our Government require that that power shall be exerted to prevent the extension of slavery into territory heretofore free . Resolved , That the repeal of the Missouri Compromise was unwise and injurious ; an open and aggravated violation of the plighted faith of the States , and that the attempt of the present administration to force slavery into Kansas against the known wishes of the legal voters of that Territory is an arbitrary and tyrannous violation of the rights of the people to govern themselves , and that we will strive by all constitutional means to secure to Kansas and Nebraska the legal guaranty against slavery of which they were deprived at the cost of the violation of the plighted faith of the nation . Resolved , That we are devoted to the Union and will , to the last extremity , defend it against the efforts now being made by the dis-unionists of this administration to compass its dissolution , and that we will support the Constitution of the United States , in all its provisions regarding it , as the sacred bond of our Union and the only safeguard for the preservation of the rights of ourselves and our posterity . Resolved , That we are in favor of the immediate admission of Kansas as a member of this Confederacy under the constitution adopted by the people of said Territory . Resolved , That the spirit of our institutions as well as the Constitution of our country , guarantees the liberty of conscience as well as political freedom , and that we will proscribe no one by legislation or otherwise on account of religious opinions , or in consequence of place of birth . Lincoln delivered the closing address . The speech was purportedly so captivating that no reporter made a record of it . The address has become known as Lincoln 's Lost Speech .

In 1831 , Jackson made it clear that he was going to run for re-election , ensuring that support or opposition to his presidency would be a central feature of the upcoming race . Jackson 's Democrats rallied around his policies towards the national bank , internal improvements , Indian removal , and nullification , but these policies also earned Jackson various enemies , including Vice President John C.

However , Clay rejected overtures from the fledgling Anti-Masonic Party , and his attempt to convince Calhoun to serve as his running mate failed , leaving the opposition to Jackson split among different factions .

		CONTEXT=During the 1840s , Bowser painted banners for a diverse range of clients , including the Know Nothing Party , and received a commission to paint the portrait of prominent abolitionist and real estate developer Jacob C. White . Active in that decade 's efforts to repeal the clause in Pennsylvania 's Constitution which prohibited blacks from voting , Bowser and his family also became so involved with the abolition movement that their home became a stop on the Underground Railroad . In 1858 , politics and advocacy merged with art when Bower painted the portrait of abolitionist John Brown while Brown was visiting the Bowser home . During this same period , Bowser also completed work on his painting , '' The Firebell in the Night '' . In addition , he was also active , during this phase of his life , with the Grand United Order of Odd Fellows . As Grand Master of the Order in Philadelphia , he delivered the keynote address at the Annual Moveable Committee of the G.U.O. of O.F. in Toronto , Canada on October 17 , 1859 as its members celebrated the organization 's thirteenth anniversary . According to news reports , he was " listened to throughout with much attention , and was frequently rapturously applauded " as he " defined in eloquent terms the nature of the work of Odd Fellows — especially that great and leading principle , Charity , " and " remarked upon the practical good effected by Odd Fellowship , in alleviating distress and bestowing many of the comforts of life upon the aged and infirm of the Order , as well as conferring benefactions upon the widow and orphan . " Bowser 's work on the first banner was paid for through a commission awarded by the Contraband Relief Association ( CRA ) , an organization headed by Elizabeth Keckley , the formerly enslaved woman who became Mary Todd Lincoln 's dressmaker . It was then presented by the CRA to the leaders of 1st United States Colored Infantry . With respect to the other Bowser-designed battle flags , historians at the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission note that : " The 127th and 3rd regiments marched carrying banners reading ' We will prove ourselves men ' and ' Rather Die Freemen , Than Live To Be Slaves . ' Beneath these , black soldiers protect white women representing Columbia , the symbol of the republic . The 45th 's banner , proclaiming ' One Cause , One Country , ' shows a black soldier proudly holding an American flag in front of a bust of George Washington as black troops fight in the background . The 24th 's banner shows a black soldier ascending a hill , his arms outstretched in prayer , beneath the words ' Let Soldiers in War , Be Citizens in Peace . ' " For the 22nd USCT banner , Bowser depicted a black soldier pointing " a bayonet at the chest of a Confederate who has allowed his flag to fall and who is tossing aside his sword , " beneath the words , " Sic semper tyrannis " ( " thus always to tyrants " ) , a phrase which would come to have an entirely different meaning two years later when shouted by John Wilkes Booth after his assassination of Lincoln at Ford 's Theater

		CONTEXT=RR Caeli is a double star in the constellation Caelum . It is approximately 66 light years from Earth . It was first noted to be a high - proper motion star in 1955 by Jacob Luyten , and given the name LFT 349 . Discovered to be an eclipsing binary in 1979 , it has a baseline magnitude of 14.36 , dimming markedly every 7.2 hours for an interval of around 10 minutes , due to the total eclipse of the brighter star by the fainter one . Its variability in brightness led to its being given the variable star designation RR Caeli in 1984 . This star system consists of a red dwarf of spectral type M6 and a white dwarf that orbit each other every seven hours ; the former is 18 % as massive as the Sun , while the latter has 44 % of the Sun 's mass . The red dwarf is tidally locked with the white dwarf , meaning it displays the same side to the heavier star . The system is also a post-common-envelope binary , and the red dwarf star is transferring material onto the white dwarf . In approximately 9 – 20 billion years , RR Caeli will likely become a cataclysmic variable star due to the period 's gradual shortening , leading to increasing rates of transfer of hydrogen to the surface of the white dwarf . The white dwarf is likely to have a plain helium core , as its density is too low for the carbon - oxygen core .

		CONTEXT=Tau Ceti is a star that hosts a planetary system and a common locale in much science fiction . It is the second closest spectral class G star to the Sun ( after Alpha Centauri A ) , making it a popular story setting or system of origin in science fiction tales . The Sun , itself of spectral class G , provides an obvious model for the possibility that the star might harbor worlds capable of supporting life . But Tau Ceti , weighing in at ~ 0.78 , is metal - poor and so is thought to be unlikely to host rocky planets ( see Destination : Void by Frank Herbert below ) ; on the other hand , observations have detected more than ten times as much dust around the star than exists in the Solar System , a condition tending to enhance the probability of such bodies . Since the star 's luminosity is barely 55 % that of the Sun , those planets would need to circle it at the orbital radius of Venus in order to match the insolation received by the Earth .

		CONTEXT=HD 140283 ( or the Methuselah star ) [ 10 ] is a metal - poor subgiant star about 200 light years away from the Earth in the constellation Libra , near the boundary with Ophiuchus in the Milky Way Galaxy . Its apparent magnitude is 7.205 . It is the oldest star known as of 2021 . The star 's light is somewhat blueshifted as it is moving toward rather than away from the Earth and it has been known to astronomers for over a century as a high - velocity star based on its other vectors ( proper motion ) . An early spectroscopic analysis by Joseph W. Chamberlain and Lawrence Aller revealed it to have a substantially lower metal content than the Sun . [ 11 ] Modern spectroscopic analyses find an iron content about a factor of 250 lower than that of the Sun . It is one of the closest metal - poor ( Population II ) stars to Earth .

		CONTEXT=Nemesis is a hypothetical red dwarf or brown dwarf , originally postulated in 1984 to be orbiting the Sun at a distance of about 95,000 AU ( 1.5 light - years ) , somewhat beyond the Oort cloud , to explain a perceived cycle of mass extinctions in the geological record , which seem to occur more often at intervals of 26 million years . , more than 1800 brown dwarfs have been identified . There are actually fewer brown dwarfs in our cosmic neighborhood than previously thought . Rather than one star for every brown dwarf , there may be as many as six stars for every brown dwarf . The majority of solar - type stars are single . The previous idea stated half or perhaps most stellar systems were binary , trinary , or multiple - star systems associated with clusters of stars , rather than the single - star systems that tend to be seen most often . In a 2017 paper , Sarah Sadavoy and Steven Stahler argued that the Sun was likely part of a binary system at the time of its formation , leading them to suggest " there probably was a Nemesis , a long time ago " . Such a star would have separated from this binary system over four billion years ago , meaning it could not be responsible for the more recent perceived cycle of mass extinctions , Douglas Vakoch told Business Insider , adding that " If the sun really was part of a binary star system in its early days , its early twin deserves a benign name like Companion , rather than the threatening Nemesis .

		CONTEXT=In the field of astronomy the term chord typically refers to a line crossing an object which is formed during an occultation event . By taking accurate measurements of the start and end times of the event , in conjunction with the known location of the observer and the object 's orbit , the length of the chord can be determined giving an indication of the size of the occulting object . By combining observations made from several different locations , multiple chords crossing the occulting object can be determined giving a more accurate shape and size model . This technique of using multiple observers during the same event has been used to derive more sophisticated shape models for asteroids , whose shape can be highly irregular . A notable example of this occurred in 2002 when the asteroid 345 Tercidina underwent a stellar occultation of a very bright star as seen from Europe . During this event a team of at least 105 observers recorded 75 chords across the asteroid 's surface allowing for a very accurate size and shape determination .

In one incident in the 2010 preseason he was removed from training and verbally reprimanded by club leadership when he was deemed unfit to train after a big night out . Despite these struggles , his on-field development was such that he would still debut in the 2010 season 's opening match , a 56-point Richmond loss against at the MCG . Martin recorded the sixth most disposals of any Tiger ( 18 ) to go along with four marks , three tackles and three clearances . Two weeks later Martin was convicted by the AFL tribunal for a high hit on Sydney 's Josh Kennedy in round 3 . He did not receive a suspension for the incident however , returning to football the following week . After four matches Martin ranked fourth in the league for clearances and eighth for hard-ball gets . Media reports emerged after round 8 that the 18 year old Martin had received a significant contract offer from expansion club the Greater Western Sydney Giants . The offer , which the Herald Sun ’s Mark Robinson claimed to be worth $ 2.4 million over three seasons , would have taken effect in the new club 's first AFL season in 2012 . Martin later said he had never entertained the idea of moving to the start-up club . In round 10 he had gained attention for his on-field efforts again , this time being nominated for the 2010 AFL Rising Star award after a 21 disposal and 11 clearance match against Port Adelaide . Due to his previous tribunal conviction however , Martin was ruled ineligible for the award and thus did not officially place in the end of season award 's points tally . He drew the attention of Sydney coach Paul Roos by round 14 , prompting Roos to send veteran Brett Kirk onto Martin in a tagging role . Despite this extra attention , he still managed to record 18 disposals and a goal in the match at the MCG . After 17 rounds Martin ranked second at the club for clearances and inside 50s as well as third for disposals and contested possessions . At the same time he ranked first among that season 's Rising Star nominees in clearances , contested possessions and inside 50s . He was also fourth for average disposals and fifth for average tackles . In round 19 he was rested by the club before returning to play out the final five matches of the season . He missed just that one game in his debut season and finished the year ranked second at Richmond for clearances and inside 50s , as well as third for both contested possessions and disposals . In addition to winning the Fred Swift Medal for fourth place at the club 's best and fairest night , Martin also received six votes in the Brownlow Medal count that year , the most by any Richmond debutant since Craig Lambert in 1988 .

That there was a space opening up , maybe a billion little loudspeakers walking around the planet , but nobody was really thinking of this as a space for creative music . So I set out to make these tiny little fragments and then , of course , in the poetic sense , the idea of these little sound carrying objects traversing the planet , I started to think of these as a connection , as a sort of postcard into somebody 's life , into their space . " Richter 's 2010 album '' Infra '' takes as its central theme the 2005 terrorist bombings in London , and is an extension of his 25-minute score for a ballet of the same name choreographed by Wayne McGregor and staged at the Royal Opera House . '' Infra '' comprises music written for piano , electronics and string quintet , plus the full performance score and material that subsequently developed from the construction of the album . '' Pitchfork '' described the album as " achingly gorgeous " and '' The Independent '' newspaper characterised it as " a journey in 13 episodes , emerging from a blur of static and finding its way in a repeated phrase that grows in loveliness . " Richter 's recomposed version of Vivaldi 's '' The Four Seasons '' , '' Recomposed by Max Richter : Vivaldi – The Four Seasons '' , was premiered in the UK at the Barbican Centre on 31 October 2012 , performed by the Britten Sinfonia , conducted by André de Ridder and with violinist Daniel Hope .

The album topped the iTunes classical chart in the UK , Germany and the US . The US launch concert in New York at Le Poisson Rouge was recorded by NPR and streamed

		CONTEXT=He arrived at the club as an incredibly shy and underdeveloped personality , a fact that was noted by teammate Trent Cotchin who said though Martin was 18 “ he seemed much younger in some of the ways he behaved . ” Indeed , he struggled initially to adjust to the expectations of professional football . In one incident in the 2010 preseason he was removed from training and verbally reprimanded by club leadership when he was deemed unfit to train after a big night out . Despite these struggles , his on-field development was such that he would still debut in the 2010 season 's opening match , a 56-point Richmond loss against at the MCG . Martin recorded the sixth most disposals of any Tiger ( 18 ) to go along with four marks , three tackles and three clearances . Two weeks later Martin was convicted by the AFL tribunal for a high hit on Sydney 's Josh Kennedy in round 3 . He did not receive a suspension for the incident however , returning to football the following week . After four matches Martin ranked fourth in the league for clearances and eighth for hard-ball gets . Media reports emerged after round 8 that the 18 year old Martin had received a significant contract offer from expansion club the Greater Western Sydney Giants . The offer , which the Herald Sun ’s Mark Robinson claimed to be worth $ 2.4 million over three seasons , would have taken effect in the new club 's first AFL season in 2012 . Martin later said he had never entertained the idea of moving to the start-up club . In round 10 he had gained attention for his on-field efforts again , this time being nominated for the 2010 AFL Rising Star award after a 21 disposal and 11 clearance match against Port Adelaide . Due to his previous tribunal conviction however , Martin was ruled ineligible for the award and thus did not officially place in the end of season award 's points tally . He drew the attention of Sydney coach Paul Roos by round 14 , prompting Roos to send veteran Brett Kirk onto Martin in a tagging role . Despite this extra attention , he still managed to record 18 disposals and a goal in the match at the MCG . After 17 rounds Martin ranked second at the club for clearances and inside 50s as well as third for disposals and contested possessions . At the same time he ranked first among that season 's Rising Star nominees in clearances , contested possessions and inside 50s . He was also fourth for average disposals and fifth for average tackles . In round 19 he was rested by the club before returning to play out the final five matches of the season . He missed just that one game in his debut season and finished the year ranked second at Richmond for clearances and inside 50s , as well as third for both contested possessions and disposals . In addition to winning the Fred Swift Medal for fourth place at the club 's best and fairest night , Martin also received six votes in the Brownlow Medal count that year , the most by any Richmond debutant since Craig Lambert in 1988 . At season 's end he reiterated his commitment to the club ( and rejection of the former GWS overtures ) by signing a two-year contract extension that would keep him at Richmond until the end of the 2013 season . The extension was reported by the Herald Sun to be in the vicinity of $ 400,000-a-year

" Why would Dre put me in it ? I mean 'cause if they start from where they start from I was just a quiet girlfriend who got beat up and told to shut up . " On August 18 , 2015 , Gawker published an editorial by Dee Barnes titled " Here 's What 's Missing From Straight Outta Compton : Me and the Other Women Dr. Dre Beat Up " . Barnes notes that Dr. Dre had repeated instances of physical abuse to female associates during his time in N.W.A , to include the infamous January 1991 beating of Barnes in the bathroom of Po Na Na Souk nightclub . In the film , the incidents were never acknowledged . She further notes that important women from the era with close and historically important ties to N.W.A ( JJ Fad , Yo Yo , Tairrie B , etc. ) were absent from the film . In the end , most women portrayed in the film are partying groupies , with Barnes feeling that it could have also acknowledged the female MCs who contributed to N.W.A 's and/or individual members ' success .

		CONTEXT=On August 17 , 2015 , Michel ' le , Dr. Dres former girlfriend and mother of one of his children , did an exclusive interview with Vlad TV . In the interview , the former Ruthless and Death Row Records artist ponders her and Dre 's abusive relationship and she states that she was aware she was not included in the '' Straight Outta Compton '' film . " Why would Dre put me in it ? I mean 'cause if they start from where they start from I was just a quiet girlfriend who got beat up and told to shut up . " On August 18 , 2015 , Gawker published an editorial by Dee Barnes titled " Here 's What 's Missing From Straight Outta Compton : Me and the Other Women Dr. Dre Beat Up " . Barnes notes that Dr. Dre had repeated instances of physical abuse to female associates during his time in N.W.A , to include the infamous January 1991 beating of Barnes in the bathroom of Po Na Na Souk nightclub . In the film , the incidents were never acknowledged . She further notes that important women from the era with close and historically important ties to N.W.A ( JJ Fad , Yo Yo , Tairrie B , etc. ) were absent from the film . In the end , most women portrayed in the film are partying groupies , with Barnes feeling that it could have also acknowledged the female MCs who contributed to N.W.A 's and/or individual members ' success . Gerrick D. Kennedy of the '' Los Angeles Times '' revealed the Barnes incident was originally included in an earlier version of the film 's script . On August 21 , 2015 , Dr. Dre responded , apologizing to " the women I ’ve hurt . I deeply regret what I did and know that it has forever impacted all of our lives . " The next day , Apple Inc. , which bought Beats Electronics for $ 3 billion in 2014 from Dr. Dre and made him an executive , weighed in on the abuse allegations to offer their support to Dre . Apple said in a statement , " Dre has apologized for the mistakes he 's made in the past and he 's said that he 's not the same person that he was 25 years ago . " On August 26 , 2015 , Randall Roberts of the '' Los Angeles Times '' criticized the film for leaving out the story of the all female rap group J. J. Fad and how some in the media claim the group was responsible for " forging a path for the breakout success of N.W.A. " The film received numerous award nominations , including one for Best Original Screenplay at the Oscars

		CONTEXT=The history of Meridian , Mississippi begins in the early 19th century before European - American settlement . Originally settled by the Choctaw Indians , the land was bought by the United States according to the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek in 1830 . The city grew around the intersection of the Mobile and Ohio Railroad and the Southern Railway of Mississippi and developed a largely rail - based economy . Although much of the city was burned down in the Battle of Meridian during the American Civil War , the city was rebuilt and entered a " Golden Age . " Between about 1890 and 1930 , the city was the largest in Mississippi and a leading center for manufacturing in the Southern United States . After the decline of the railroading industry in the 1950s , the city 's economy was devastated , resulting in a slow population decline . The population has continued to decline as the city has struggled to create a new , more modern economy based on newer industries . In the past 20 years or so , Meridian has attempted to revitalize the city 's economy by attracting more business and industry to the city , most specifically the downtown area .

		GOLD_MENTION=S7 Airlines Flight 778
		CONTEXT=Rasputin 's daughter Maria died in the 2006 crash of S7 Airlines Flight 778 , and his wife died six years later . He died in Moscow on 14 March 2015 , a day short of his 78th birthday . Patriarch Kirill of the Russian Orthodox Church conducted his funeral service , and President Vladimir Putin paid his respects . ( In 2014 Rasputin had co-signed a letter by writers in support of Putin 's annexation of the Crimea . ) Rasputin is closely associated with a movement in post-war Soviet literature known as " village prose , " or sometimes " rural prose " ( деревенская проза ) . Beginning in the time of the Khrushchev Thaw ( оттепель ) , village prose was praised for its stylistic and thematic departures from socialist realism . Village prose works usually focused on the hardships of the Soviet peasantry , espoused an idealized picture of traditional village life , and implicitly or explicitly criticized official modernization projects . Rasputin 's 1979 novel '' Farewell to Matyora '' , which depicts a fictional Siberian village which is to be evacuated and cleared so that a hydroelectric dam can be constructed further down the Angara River , was considered the epitome of this genre . The opening paragraph below is a good example of Rasputin 's writing style ( exceptional even for the village prose writers ) , and the novel 's theme of natural cycles disrupted by modernization : '' Once more spring had come , one more in the never-ending cycle , but for Matyora this spring would be the last , the last for both the island and the village that bore the same name . Once more , rumbling passionately , the ice broke , piling up mounds on the banks , and the liberated Angara River opened up , stretching out into a mighty , sparkling flow . Once more the water gushed boisterously at the island ’s upper tip , before cascading down both channels of the riverbed ; once more greenery flared on the ground and in the greens , the first rains soaked the earth , the swifts and swallows flew back , and at dusk in the bogs the awakened frogs croaked their love of life . It had all happened many times before . '' ( From Rasputin 's novel '' Farewell to Matyora '' , translated by Antonina W. Bouis , 1979 ) Rasputin 's nonfiction works contain similar themes , often in support of relevant political causes . He directed particularly trenchant criticism at large-scale dam building , like the project that flooded his own hometown , and water management projects , like the diversion of the Siberian rivers to Central Asia . He argued that these projects were destructive not simply in an ecological sense , but in a moral sense as well

		CONTEXT=The dangers to journalists in Russia have been well known since the early 1990s but concern over the number of unsolved killings soared after Anna Politkovskaya 's murder in Moscow on 7 October 2006 . While international monitors mentioned a dozen deaths , some sources within Russia talked of over two hundred fatalities . The evidence has since been examined and documented in two reports , published in Russian and English , by international organizations . These revealed a basic confusion in terminology that explained the seemingly enormous numerical discrepancy : statistics of premature death among journalists ( from work accidents , crossfire incidents , and purely criminal or domestic cases of manslaughter ) were repeatedly equated with the much smaller number of targeted ( contract ) killings or work - related murders . The Remembrance Day of Journalists Killed in the Line of Duty in Russia is observed on 15 December every year .

An oil-producing town in northern Sakhalin , all buildings in Neftegorsk suffered extensive damage and many were completely destroyed , as they had been built with low quality concrete and were not designed to withstand seismic activity . The majority of the victims were killed by the rubble of their apartment buildings collapsing . Neftegorsk was almost totally flattened , and it was decided not to be rebuilt , instead a memorial was constructed in the area . Many survivors were relocated to other towns in Sakhalin such as Okha , Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk , and Nogliki , while others left Sakhalin for the mainland

		CONTEXT=The concept of " curvature of space " is fundamental to cosmology . A space without curvature is called a " flat space " or Euclidean space . Whether the universe is “ flat ″ could determine its ultimate fate ; whether it will expand forever , or ultimately collapse back into itself . The geometry of spacetime has been measured by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe ( WMAP ) to be nearly flat . According to the WMAP 5 - year results and analysis , “ WMAP determined that the universe is flat , from which it follows that the mean energy density in the universe is equal to the critical density ( within a 1 % margin of error ) . This is equivalent to a mass density of 9.9 × 10 − 30 g / cm 3 , which is equivalent to only 5.9 protons per cubic meter . ” The WMAP data are consistent with a flat geometry , with Ω = 1.02 + / - 0.02 .

		CONTEXT=The Big Bounce is a hypothesized cosmological model for the origin of the known universe . It was originally suggested as a phase of the cyclic model or oscillatory universe interpretation of the Big Bang , where the first cosmological event was the result of the collapse of a previous universe . It receded from serious consideration in the early 1980s after inflation theory emerged as a solution to the horizon problem , which had arisen from advances in observations revealing the large - scale structure of the universe . In the early 2000s , inflation was found by some theorists to be problematic and unfalsifiable in that its various parameters could be adjusted to fit any observations , so that the properties of the observable universe are a matter of chance . Alternative pictures including a Big Bounce may provide a predictive and falsifiable possible solution to the horizon problem , and are under active investigation as of 2017 .

The discovery was published as a non-peer reviewed paper in arXiv announcing a 0.45 m meteor detected on January 8 , 2014 in northeast coast of Papua New Guinea . According to the researchers , the meteor originated from an unbound hyperbolic orbit with a confidence of 99.999 % . The interstellar candidate was found in data from the Center for Near - Earth Object Studies . The estimated speed of the meteor , around 60 - km per second , was likely produced in the innermost cores of another stellar system .

		CONTEXT=Nemesis is a hypothetical red dwarf or brown dwarf , originally postulated in 1984 to be orbiting the Sun at a distance of about 95,000 AU ( 1.5 light - years ) , somewhat beyond the Oort cloud , to explain a perceived cycle of mass extinctions in the geological record , which seem to occur more often at intervals of 26 million years . , more than 1800 brown dwarfs have been identified . There are actually fewer brown dwarfs in our cosmic neighborhood than previously thought . Rather than one star for every brown dwarf , there may be as many as six stars for every brown dwarf . The majority of solar - type stars are single . The previous idea stated half or perhaps most stellar systems were binary , trinary , or multiple - star systems associated with clusters of stars , rather than the single - star systems that tend to be seen most often . In a 2017 paper , Sarah Sadavoy and Steven Stahler argued that the Sun was likely part of a binary system at the time of its formation , leading them to suggest " there probably was a Nemesis , a long time ago " . Such a star would have separated from this binary system over four billion years ago , meaning it could not be responsible for the more recent perceived cycle of mass extinctions , Douglas Vakoch told Business Insider , adding that " If the sun really was part of a binary star system in its early days , its early twin deserves a benign name like Companion , rather than the threatening Nemesis .

		CONTEXT=And Japan was eager to take every opportunity . In 1869 they took advantage of the defeat of the rebels of the Republic of Ezo to incorporate definitely the island of Hokkaido to Japan . For centuries , Japan viewed the Ryukyu Islands as one of its provinces . In 1871 the Mudan incident happened : cannibal Taiwanese aborigines murdered 54 Ryūkyūan sailors that had their ship shipwrecked . At that time the Ryukyu Islands were claimed by both Qing China and Japan , and the Japanese interpreted the incident as an attack on their citizens . They took steps to bring the islands in their jurisdiction : in 1872 the Japanese Ryukyu Domain was declared , and in 1874 a retaliatory incursion to Taiwan was sent , which was a success . The success of this expedition emboldened the Japanese : not even the Americans could defeat the Taiwanese cannibals in the Formosa Expedition of 1867 . Very few gave it much thought at the time , but this was the first move in the Japanese expansionism series . Japan occupied Taiwan for the rest of 1874 and then left owing to Chinese pressures , but in 1879 it finally annexed the Ryukyu Islands . In 1875 Qing China sent a 300-men force to subdue the Taiwanese cannibals , but unlike the Japanese the Chinese were routed , ambushed and 250 of their men were killed ; the failure of this expedition exposed once more the failure of Qing China to exert effective control in Taiwan , and acted as another incentive for the Japanese to annex Taiwan . Eventually , the spoils for winning the First Sino-Japanese War in 1894 included Taiwan

		GOLD_MENTION=S7 Airlines Flight 778
		CONTEXT=Rasputin 's daughter Maria died in the 2006 crash of S7 Airlines Flight 778 , and his wife died six years later . He died in Moscow on 14 March 2015 , a day short of his 78th birthday . Patriarch Kirill of the Russian Orthodox Church conducted his funeral service , and President Vladimir Putin paid his respects . ( In 2014 Rasputin had co-signed a letter by writers in support of Putin 's annexation of the Crimea . ) Rasputin is closely associated with a movement in post-war Soviet literature known as " village prose , " or sometimes " rural prose " ( деревенская проза ) . Beginning in the time of the Khrushchev Thaw ( оттепель ) , village prose was praised for its stylistic and thematic departures from socialist realism . Village prose works usually focused on the hardships of the Soviet peasantry , espoused an idealized picture of traditional village life , and implicitly or explicitly criticized official modernization projects . Rasputin 's 1979 novel '' Farewell to Matyora '' , which depicts a fictional Siberian village which is to be evacuated and cleared so that a hydroelectric dam can be constructed further down the Angara River , was considered the epitome of this genre . The opening paragraph below is a good example of Rasputin 's writing style ( exceptional even for the village prose writers ) , and the novel 's theme of natural cycles disrupted by modernization : '' Once more spring had come , one more in the never-ending cycle , but for Matyora this spring would be the last , the last for both the island and the village that bore the same name . Once more , rumbling passionately , the ice broke , piling up mounds on the banks , and the liberated Angara River opened up , stretching out into a mighty , sparkling flow . Once more the water gushed boisterously at the island ’s upper tip , before cascading down both channels of the riverbed ; once more greenery flared on the ground and in the greens , the first rains soaked the earth , the swifts and swallows flew back , and at dusk in the bogs the awakened frogs croaked their love of life . It had all happened many times before . '' ( From Rasputin 's novel '' Farewell to Matyora '' , translated by Antonina W. Bouis , 1979 ) Rasputin 's nonfiction works contain similar themes , often in support of relevant political causes . He directed particularly trenchant criticism at large-scale dam building , like the project that flooded his own hometown , and water management projects , like the diversion of the Siberian rivers to Central Asia . He argued that these projects were destructive not simply in an ecological sense , but in a moral sense as well

		CONTEXT=Trnopolje was described variously as a ghetto , a prison and a detention camp . A United Nations ( UN ) report from 1994 reported that Trnopolje was a concentration camp which functioned as a staging area for mass deportations mainly of women , children , and elderly men . The reported found that : Refugees reported that Trnopolje was a " decent " camp in comparison to Omarska and Keraterm as there were no systematic killings , only arbitrary ones . Indeed , many non-Serbs entered the camp voluntarily , " simply to avoid the rampaging militias plundering their streets and villages " . This phenomenon led British journalist Ed Vulliamy to describe Trnopolje as " a perverse haven " for the Bosniaks and Croats of Prijedor . Author Hariz Halilovich writes : Many inmates were starved and physically or verbally abused during their imprisonment . By August 1992 , Trnopolje held about 3,500 people . On 7 August 1992 , reporters from Independent Television News ( ITN ) , a British television station , took footage of the prisoners at Omarska and Trnopolje , and recorded their living conditions . The images were shown around the world and caused public outrage . This prompted the Bosnian Serb authorities to allow journalists and the International Red Cross ( IRC ) access to some of the Prijedor camps , but not before the most emaciated of the prisoners were killed or shipped off to camps far from the public eye . Some 200 former male inmates were separated and killed in the Korićani Cliffs massacre on 21 August 1992 . The publicity generated by the discovery of the Prijedor camps led to their closure by the end of August . In mid-August , Trnopolje was placed into the hands of the IRC . The camp was officially shut down that November

Soon her parents are deported , and Marija witnesses the atrocity of the Novi Sad raid , in which Hungarian troops killed between 3,000 and 4,000 civilians , in January 1942 .

		CONTEXT=Trnopolje was described variously as a ghetto , a prison and a detention camp . A United Nations ( UN ) report from 1994 reported that Trnopolje was a concentration camp which functioned as a staging area for mass deportations mainly of women , children , and elderly men . The reported found that : Refugees reported that Trnopolje was a " decent " camp in comparison to Omarska and Keraterm as there were no systematic killings , only arbitrary ones . Indeed , many non-Serbs entered the camp voluntarily , " simply to avoid the rampaging militias plundering their streets and villages " . This phenomenon led British journalist Ed Vulliamy to describe Trnopolje as " a perverse haven " for the Bosniaks and Croats of Prijedor . Author Hariz Halilovich writes : Many inmates were starved and physically or verbally abused during their imprisonment . By August 1992 , Trnopolje held about 3,500 people . On 7 August 1992 , reporters from Independent Television News ( ITN ) , a British television station , took footage of the prisoners at Omarska and Trnopolje , and recorded their living conditions . The images were shown around the world and caused public outrage . This prompted the Bosnian Serb authorities to allow journalists and the International Red Cross ( IRC ) access to some of the Prijedor camps , but not before the most emaciated of the prisoners were killed or shipped off to camps far from the public eye . Some 200 former male inmates were separated and killed in the Korićani Cliffs massacre on 21 August 1992 . The publicity generated by the discovery of the Prijedor camps led to their closure by the end of August . In mid-August , Trnopolje was placed into the hands of the IRC . The camp was officially shut down that November

		CONTEXT=On March 27 , 2017 , Archie Miller was named the 29th head coach in the history of the men 's basketball program . Miller 's first season was a major remodeling job , starting with laying the foundation of a pack-line defense and valuing possessions . Early in the season , Miller stated practices were 75 % defense , 25 % offense . That scheme showed early and often , as the Hoosiers struggled mightily throughout the season to find any flow or rhythm on offense , despite the defense making leaps and bounds in the overall rankings of Division 1 basketball . With a surprising early second round loss in the 2018 Big Ten Tournament to Rutgers , 67 – 76 , and losing enough games to keep them out of both the NCAA tournament and NIT , including games in which they were favored , such as Indiana State and Fort Wayne , IU 's first season under their new coach came to a disappointing close . They finished with an overall record of 16 – 15 and 9 – 9 in the Big Ten

		CONTEXT=During a ceremony , sometimes a celebrity presenter or award winner might not know when they are going to be slimed onstage or offstage , though as the years went on , getting slimed became more of an honor , and less of the comedic humiliation of where the concept originated , with the early Nickelodeon series '' You Ca n't Do That on Television '' . Hosts of the show have also been slimed , especially in recent years , and occasionally celebrities not attending the awards have been slimed via video segment , such as when Rosie O'Donnell tricked Melissa Joan Hart into getting slimed on the set of '' Sabrina the Teenage Witch '' in 2001 , or when Amanda Seyfried and Josh Hutcherson were slimed at a KCA watch party in 2013 . Celebrities sitting in the audience are also fair game for being slimed , as Mandy Moore first learned in 2007 , and Halle Berry later found out in 2012 . Although Les Lye was the only celebrity to be slimed at the 1988 Awards , a video was shown during the show of then Nickelodeon president Geraldine Laybourne saying the magic words and getting slimed with the original '' YCDTOTV '' recipe , much to her dismay , proving that not even the network president was safe from the slime . Last but not least , in addition to the celebrity slimings in 1992 , the entire audience was slimed at the end of the show , which began a long running tradition known as '' The Final Slime '' , which is still in effect as of the 2019 Awards

		CONTEXT=On behalf of the WJC , Singer also made a number of policy statements . He notably expressed alarm that companies would profit from surging digital sales of Adolf Hitler 's book " Mein Kampf " . Singer told ABC News that " w hile the academic study of Mein Kampf is certainly legitimate , the spike in ebook sales likely comes from neo-Nazis and skinheads idolizing the greatest monster in history , " and added : " We think that responsible companies should n't profiteer from the sales of hate books , or at least should donate the profits to help the victims of anti-Semitism , racism and other like bigotries . " Following the 2014 Gaza conflict and a subsequent surge in anti-Semitic activity , Singer urged European governments to " strengthen police protection of Jewish sites and to ban or disband violent rallies . " He urged them to " stop the agitation and protect their Jewish populations , or Jews will ultimately turn their back on those countries . Jews live in Europe by right , not sufferance . " Addressing a pro-Israel rally in Stockholm , Sweden , on 31 August 2014 , Singer declared : “ Israel and its actions in Gaza are used as an excuse to besiege a synagogue in Paris , to shout ‘ Jews to the gas ’ on the streets of Berlin , or to attack people wearing a Jewish skullcap . None of this is acceptable , and it is high time that European leaders stand up against these expressions of antisemitism and take action . ” In September 2014 , it was announced that the World Jewish Congress would play a leading role in preparing the commemorative events in Auschwitz marking the 70th anniversary of the liberation of the notorious Nazi death camp , in January 2015 . In a press release , Singer said : " This will probably mark the last time that so many survivors will be able to join us at Auschwitz , and we must ensure that the unspeakable suffering they and many others had to endure at Auschwitz will not be forgotten once they are no longer among us . " Following the 2015 Copenhagen shootings , Singer traveled to Norway , Denmark , and Finland where he met with the leadership of Jewish communities as well as senior government officials

		GOLD_MENTION=S7 Airlines Flight 778
		CONTEXT=Rasputin 's daughter Maria died in the 2006 crash of S7 Airlines Flight 778 , and his wife died six years later . He died in Moscow on 14 March 2015 , a day short of his 78th birthday . Patriarch Kirill of the Russian Orthodox Church conducted his funeral service , and President Vladimir Putin paid his respects . ( In 2014 Rasputin had co-signed a letter by writers in support of Putin 's annexation of the Crimea . ) Rasputin is closely associated with a movement in post-war Soviet literature known as " village prose , " or sometimes " rural prose " ( деревенская проза ) . Beginning in the time of the Khrushchev Thaw ( оттепель ) , village prose was praised for its stylistic and thematic departures from socialist realism . Village prose works usually focused on the hardships of the Soviet peasantry , espoused an idealized picture of traditional village life , and implicitly or explicitly criticized official modernization projects . Rasputin 's 1979 novel '' Farewell to Matyora '' , which depicts a fictional Siberian village which is to be evacuated and cleared so that a hydroelectric dam can be constructed further down the Angara River , was considered the epitome of this genre . The opening paragraph below is a good example of Rasputin 's writing style ( exceptional even for the village prose writers ) , and the novel 's theme of natural cycles disrupted by modernization : '' Once more spring had come , one more in the never-ending cycle , but for Matyora this spring would be the last , the last for both the island and the village that bore the same name . Once more , rumbling passionately , the ice broke , piling up mounds on the banks , and the liberated Angara River opened up , stretching out into a mighty , sparkling flow . Once more the water gushed boisterously at the island ’s upper tip , before cascading down both channels of the riverbed ; once more greenery flared on the ground and in the greens , the first rains soaked the earth , the swifts and swallows flew back , and at dusk in the bogs the awakened frogs croaked their love of life . It had all happened many times before . '' ( From Rasputin 's novel '' Farewell to Matyora '' , translated by Antonina W. Bouis , 1979 ) Rasputin 's nonfiction works contain similar themes , often in support of relevant political causes . He directed particularly trenchant criticism at large-scale dam building , like the project that flooded his own hometown , and water management projects , like the diversion of the Siberian rivers to Central Asia . He argued that these projects were destructive not simply in an ecological sense , but in a moral sense as well

		CONTEXT=The dangers to journalists in Russia have been well known since the early 1990s but concern over the number of unsolved killings soared after Anna Politkovskaya 's murder in Moscow on 7 October 2006 . While international monitors mentioned a dozen deaths , some sources within Russia talked of over two hundred fatalities . The evidence has since been examined and documented in two reports , published in Russian and English , by international organizations . These revealed a basic confusion in terminology that explained the seemingly enormous numerical discrepancy : statistics of premature death among journalists ( from work accidents , crossfire incidents , and purely criminal or domestic cases of manslaughter ) were repeatedly equated with the much smaller number of targeted ( contract ) killings or work - related murders . The Remembrance Day of Journalists Killed in the Line of Duty in Russia is observed on 15 December every year .

		GOLD_MENTION=S7 Airlines Flight 778
		CONTEXT=Rasputin 's daughter Maria died in the 2006 crash of S7 Airlines Flight 778 , and his wife died six years later . He died in Moscow on 14 March 2015 , a day short of his 78th birthday . Patriarch Kirill of the Russian Orthodox Church conducted his funeral service , and President Vladimir Putin paid his respects . ( In 2014 Rasputin had co-signed a letter by writers in support of Putin 's annexation of the Crimea . ) Rasputin is closely associated with a movement in post-war Soviet literature known as " village prose , " or sometimes " rural prose " ( деревенская проза ) . Beginning in the time of the Khrushchev Thaw ( оттепель ) , village prose was praised for its stylistic and thematic departures from socialist realism . Village prose works usually focused on the hardships of the Soviet peasantry , espoused an idealized picture of traditional village life , and implicitly or explicitly criticized official modernization projects . Rasputin 's 1979 novel '' Farewell to Matyora '' , which depicts a fictional Siberian village which is to be evacuated and cleared so that a hydroelectric dam can be constructed further down the Angara River , was considered the epitome of this genre . The opening paragraph below is a good example of Rasputin 's writing style ( exceptional even for the village prose writers ) , and the novel 's theme of natural cycles disrupted by modernization : '' Once more spring had come , one more in the never-ending cycle , but for Matyora this spring would be the last , the last for both the island and the village that bore the same name . Once more , rumbling passionately , the ice broke , piling up mounds on the banks , and the liberated Angara River opened up , stretching out into a mighty , sparkling flow . Once more the water gushed boisterously at the island ’s upper tip , before cascading down both channels of the riverbed ; once more greenery flared on the ground and in the greens , the first rains soaked the earth , the swifts and swallows flew back , and at dusk in the bogs the awakened frogs croaked their love of life . It had all happened many times before . '' ( From Rasputin 's novel '' Farewell to Matyora '' , translated by Antonina W. Bouis , 1979 ) Rasputin 's nonfiction works contain similar themes , often in support of relevant political causes . He directed particularly trenchant criticism at large-scale dam building , like the project that flooded his own hometown , and water management projects , like the diversion of the Siberian rivers to Central Asia . He argued that these projects were destructive not simply in an ecological sense , but in a moral sense as well

		CONTEXT=On 18 April 1906 a major earthquake hit San Francisco , and the resulting fires destroyed over 80 % of the city , killed thousands of people , and left half of the population homeless . Misled by local propaganda as to earthquake likelihood , few residents of San Francisco had bought earthquake insurance , but they had bought fire insurance . In the wake of the devastating fires following the earthquake , many insurance companies fought paying their policyholders , often by quibbling over causality ( since the insurance was not for earthquakes ) , or paying only 75 % of the amounts due . This led to many lawsuits from policyholders . At least 14 insurers went bankrupt , and some insurers – mostly German and Austrian – simply disappeared and denied all coverage

		GOLD_MENTION=flood of 1977
		CONTEXT=The flood was preceded by rains from March 9 that did not stop until March 22 , 1936 . The storms brought warmer 50 °F ( 10 °C ) weather that was a cause of one stage of flooding and the continuous rains a second cause of flooding . The natural run-off of 1 to 3 inches ( 2.5 to 7.5 cm ) was far surpassed by the deluge of from 10 to 30 inches ( 25 to 75 cm ) of water in the region . The flood came before pending flood control legislation was enacted or any significant flood control measures implemented . The narrowness of the valleys and encroachment of buildings on the river banks contributed to record flooding . By the time nightfall came one-third of the city was under of water and by the time flooding was over twenty-five people lost their lives . The damages , estimated at $ 43 million , made it the worst flood since the flood of 1889 and the event is chronicled at the Johnstown Flood Museum After the flood , sweeping nationwide flood control laws were enacted and from 1938 to 1943 Johnstown saw many projects completed . These measures gave the people the feeling that the area was now " flood free " , and it was touted as such until the flood of 1977

		CONTEXT=The pattern of displacement along the Imperial Fault was very similar to that observed for the northern part of the rupture during the 1940 El Centro earthquake , although on this occasion the rupture did not extend across the border into Mexico . This had been explained as the behavior of individual slip patches along the Imperial Fault with two patches rupturing in 1940 and only the northern one in 1979 . The faulting that gave rise to the earthquake has been modeled by comparing synthetic seismograms with near-source strong motion recordings . This analysis showed that the rupture speed had at times exceeded the shear wave velocity , making this the first earthquake for which supershear rupture was inferred

Under the authority granted to him by this legislation , President Franklin D.

		CONTEXT=Rasputin 's daughter Maria died in the 2006 crash of S7 Airlines Flight 778 , and his wife died six years later . He died in Moscow on 14 March 2015 , a day short of his 78th birthday . Patriarch Kirill of the Russian Orthodox Church conducted his funeral service , and President Vladimir Putin paid his respects . ( In 2014 Rasputin had co-signed a letter by writers in support of Putin 's annexation of the Crimea . ) Rasputin is closely associated with a movement in post-war Soviet literature known as " village prose , " or sometimes " rural prose " ( деревенская проза ) . Beginning in the time of the Khrushchev Thaw ( оттепель ) , village prose was praised for its stylistic and thematic departures from socialist realism . Village prose works usually focused on the hardships of the Soviet peasantry , espoused an idealized picture of traditional village life , and implicitly or explicitly criticized official modernization projects . Rasputin 's 1979 novel '' Farewell to Matyora '' , which depicts a fictional Siberian village which is to be evacuated and cleared so that a hydroelectric dam can be constructed further down the Angara River , was considered the epitome of this genre . The opening paragraph below is a good example of Rasputin 's writing style ( exceptional even for the village prose writers ) , and the novel 's theme of natural cycles disrupted by modernization : '' Once more spring had come , one more in the never-ending cycle , but for Matyora this spring would be the last , the last for both the island and the village that bore the same name . Once more , rumbling passionately , the ice broke , piling up mounds on the banks , and the liberated Angara River opened up , stretching out into a mighty , sparkling flow . Once more the water gushed boisterously at the island ’s upper tip , before cascading down both channels of the riverbed ; once more greenery flared on the ground and in the greens , the first rains soaked the earth , the swifts and swallows flew back , and at dusk in the bogs the awakened frogs croaked their love of life . It had all happened many times before . '' ( From Rasputin 's novel '' Farewell to Matyora '' , translated by Antonina W. Bouis , 1979 ) Rasputin 's nonfiction works contain similar themes , often in support of relevant political causes . He directed particularly trenchant criticism at large-scale dam building , like the project that flooded his own hometown , and water management projects , like the diversion of the Siberian rivers to Central Asia . He argued that these projects were destructive not simply in an ecological sense , but in a moral sense as well

		CONTEXT=Despite the lawsuit history between the two , after Luzhkov ’s dismissal Boris Nemtsov said : ‘ I ca n’t help feeling that the current investigation is more of a revenge against Luzhkov and Baturina , and not an attempt to restore a lawful situation . I am absolutely convinced that the main task here is raiding with the help of the State . The goal is to take Baturina 's business from her for a pittance . And criminal cases are just the way to do it . It 's disgusting to take part in marauding , and I will never do it . Thus , the story of my conflict with Baturina is from now one completely over . " Luzhkov was dismissed by President Medvedev on 28 September 2010 , after returning from a holiday in Austria , citing " loss of trust " , a traditional Russian legal formula for dishonorable dismissal . In recent years , the Kremlin had consistently been replacing old regional heads , elected already during Boris Yeltsin 's time , with younger candidates . Pundits had been predicting Luzhkov 's imminent ousting for years . The September 2010 dismissal followed weeks of speculation regarding Luzhkov 's position , caused by his questioning of Medvedev 's leadership . Luzhkov had recently criticised Medvedev 's decision to halt the construction of a new highway through the Khimki Forest amid protests by environmentalists . Luzkhov had also called for a " stronger leadership " of Russia . Government-controlled television channels had run programmes criticising Luzhkov 's handling of the 2010 summer peat fires and accused him and his wife of corruption . Some observers have seen this as being part of a struggle between Medvedev and then-Prime Minister Putin . Luzhkov has officially declared that he has left the United Russia party . Luzhkov had sent a letter to the President on the 27th of September criticising Medvedev 's policy and his administration 's actions . According to the President 's press-secretary Medvedev read the letter after the decision had been made but it would not have affected his decision in any case

		CONTEXT=Traditional Māori poetry was always sung or chanted , musical rhythms rather than linguistic devices served to distinguish it from prose . There is a large store of traditional chants and songs . Rhyme or assonance were not devices used by the Māori ; only when a given text is sung or chanted will the metre become apparent . The lines are indicated by features of the music . The language of poetry tends to differ stylistically from prose . Typical features of poetic diction are the use of synonyms or contrastive opposites , and the repetition of key words . As with poetry in other languages : " Archaic words are common , including many which have lost any specific meaning and acquired a religious mystique . Abbreviated , sometimes cryptic utterances and the use of certain grammatical constructions not found in prose are also common " ( Biggs 1966:447 – 448 ) .

		GOLD_MENTION=Sundance last January
		CONTEXT=On January 27 , 2011 the festival sent 9 filmmakers to 9 cities across the US to screen and discuss their films . The cities and films included : Bob Tourtellotte of Reuters wrote " Sundance 2011 has proven to be exceptionally strong , audiences and filmmakers seem to agree . " Tourtellotte reported that Robert Redford said that three years ago the Sundance Institute " set out to get back to its roots of supporting alternative voices in cinema and he felt like this year that strategy paid off . " Redford said " This year , what has excited me , is I think the quality is increasing in diversity and is increasing in depth . " The AP reported that Redford said it 's " always a relief " when the festival ends because " it 's really exhausting . " Kenneth Turan , film critic for the '' Los Angeles Times '' , wrote " though the festival has gotten ever bigger — and ( thankfully ) more efficient in moving its close to 50,000 attendees in and out of its far-flung theaters — it still retains the scrappy , antic spirit that has animated it from the start . " Turan wrote " One of the paradoxes of Sundance is that the quirkiness and charm around the edges of the festival are not always fully appreciated because so much of the media focus is on the premieres section and the U.S. dramatic competition " which he said " are , frankly , often the weakest parts of the festival . " Turan said " Sundance 's insistence on giving equal weight to documentaries and dramas has made it into as important a nonfiction showcase as any festival in the world ; witness the fact that four out of the five Oscar-nominated docs this year debuted at Sundance last January . " He also wrote that the foreign language film competition " is a strength at Sundance , and yet that field is given even less popular attention than the documentaries . " Peter Knegt wrote that this year 's festival " probably wo n't replicate last year 's Oscar record . " He said " Despite a huge surge in sales , this year 's Sundance slate looks like it might be the least Oscar-friendly in some time . " He noted that the U.S. Dramatic Grand Jury Prize winners have been nominated for Best Picture for two years ( referring to '' Precious '' and '' Winter 's Bone '' ) . Knegt speculated on films that might be nominated for the Oscars . Films he deemed " most likely to succeed " at being nominated included : '' Like Crazy '' for Best Picture , Michael Shannon of '' Take Shelter '' for Best Actor , Elizabeth Olsen of '' Martha Marcy May Marlene '' for Best Actress , Felicity Jones of '' Like Crazy '' for Best Actress , Jessica Chastain of '' Take Shelter '' for Best Supporting Actress , '' Project Nim '' for Best Documentary Feature , '' Page One '' for Best Documentary Feature , and '' The Interrupters '' for Best Documentary Feature . He wrote " It 's reasonable to feel assured that at least one of Sundance 's docs will end up an Oscar nominee , if not two , three or four . " Jada Yuan of '' New York '' magazine wrote " perhaps the biggest highlight of the festival is just how ripe it 's been for acquisitions , with nearly 30 films getting picked up , the most at any Sundance ever . " On " why everyone is suddenly so bullish on independent film " , Owen Gleiberman wrote that the " energy and optimism at Sundance this year was n't just hype . " He said the factors he thought were driving a new evolving vision of the indie film world included : " The deals have n’t gotten cheaper — they 've gotten smarter " , a belief that last year 's new festival director John Cooper and director of programming Trevor Groth " have re-energized the festival , heightening its quality and organizing the movies with a tempting new shape and vision " , video on demand gives distributors a safety net and more confidence , and the audiences for Sundance movies are not going away , saying " The Oscars ... have become a testament to the central place that Sundance movies now occupy . " Redford was happy about the success of the festival , with about 45 films being sold vs 14 in 2010 , an increase of about 220 % . Redford said studios are realizing " there are audiences " for indie films

Metacritic gives the film a score of 68 based on reviews from 31 critics , indicating " Generally favorable . " Scott Foundas , in his review for '' Variety '' , gave the film a positive review by saying that " A beguiling fable of buried treasure and movie-fed obsession " and added that " At every turn , we can sense what ’s going on behind Kumiko ’s doleful , downcast eyes ; Kikuchi pulls us deeply into her world . " Todd McCarthy in his review for '' The Hollywood Reporter '' called the film " A work of rigorously disciplined eccentricity , Kumiko , the Treasure Hunter is at once entirely accessible and yet appealing only to a rarified crowd ready to key into its narrow-bandwidth sense of humor . " Eric Kohn of '' Indiewire '' praised the film and said that " Striking a complex tone of tragedy and uplift at the same time , '' Kumiko , the Treasure Hunter '' both celebrates the escapist power of personal fantasies and bears witness to their dangerous extremes . It 's the rare case of a story that 's inspirational and devastating at once . " David Ehrlich of ''Film.com '' gave the film 9.1 out of 10 and said that " Less of an homage to '' Fargo '' than the next appendage of the same exquisite corpse , '' Kumiko , the Treasure Hunter '' plays like a dryly hilarious riff on '' Do n't Look Now '' " but ultimately said that " it 's one of the best films to ever premiere at Sundance . " The film went on to be nominated for two Independent Spirit Awards : Best Director and Best Female Lead . For his work on '' Kumiko '' and other films , Producer Chris Ohlson received the Spirit Award 's Piaget Producers Award
