QUERY_ANSWERS={'1977 flood', 'massive flood', 'Johnstown Flood of 1977'}
QUERY_CONTEXT=The flood was preceded by rains from March 9 that did not stop until March 22 , 1936 . The storms brought warmer 50 °F ( 10 °C ) weather that was a cause of one stage of flooding and the continuous rains a second cause of flooding . The natural run-off of 1 to 3 inches ( 2.5 to 7.5 cm ) was far surpassed by the deluge of from 10 to 30 inches ( 25 to 75 cm ) of water in the region . The flood came before pending flood control legislation was enacted or any significant flood control measures implemented . The narrowness of the valleys and encroachment of buildings on the river banks contributed to record flooding . By the time nightfall came one-third of the city was under of water and by the time flooding was over twenty-five people lost their lives . The damages , estimated at $ 43 million , made it the worst flood since the flood of 1889 and the event is chronicled at the Johnstown Flood Museum After the flood , sweeping nationwide flood control laws were enacted and from 1938 to 1943 Johnstown saw many projects completed . These measures gave the people the feeling that the area was now " flood free " , and it was touted as such until the flood of 1977

As the increasing amount of federal environmental regulations became more difficult to comply with and the issues with the aging manufacturing facilities grew more significant , and as steel companies began closing down plants all over the country , by 1982 it looked as if Johnstown had exhausted its appeals . By the early 1990s , Johnstown abandoned most of its steel production , although some limited fabrication work continues

According to a report '' Hope not Hate '' , a self-described anti-fascist group closely linked to the British Labour Party , Omar Bakri bragged of connections between '' Al-Muhajiroun '' and the so-called " Tipton Three " ( Ruhal Ahmed , Asif Iqbal and Shafiq Rasul ) , who were arrested in Afghanistan fighting for the Taliban and held by the United States at Guantanamo Bay detention camp . Richard Reid the so-called " Shoe Bomber " during the failed 2001 shoe bomb attempt was radicalised at the AM-linked Finsbury Park Mosque . Aftab Manzoor , Afzal Munir and Mohamed Omar who died in Afghanistan fighting for the Taliban and the Pakistan-based '' Harkat-ul-Mujahideen '' had AM-connections . Indeed , '' Al-Muhajiroun '' maintained a safehouse in Lahore for visiting radicals fighting for the Taliban . The most explicit connection between AM and the 9/11 attacks itself was Zacarias Moussaoui who was radicalised by the group in Brixton during the 1990s ; Moussaoui pled guilty to conspiring to carry out the attacks , but was in prison in Minnesota at the time that they were carried out ( he was subsequently incarcerated at ADX Florence ) . On 11 September 2002 , Abu Hamza along with '' Al-Muhajiroun '' held a conference which came to be known as the '' " Magnificent 19 " '' meeting ( a term referring to the hijackers ) .

Omar Bakri said that attendees " look at September 11 like a battle , as a great achievement by the '' mujahideen '' against the evil superpower . I never praised September 11 after it happened but now I can see why they did it " and described Osama bin Laden and '' Al-Qaeda '' as " sincere and devoted people who stood firm against the invasion of a Muslim country .

QUERY_CONTEXT=In the 1959 review for '' Sight & Sound '' , David Vaughan calls '' Gigi '' " an elegant film " with a " cultivated visual taste which is everywhere apparent " . He summarises that " while '' Gigi '' does not represent a revival of the MGM musical in its heyday , it is a welcome extension of latter-day musical style in its adult subject-matter and its avoidance of spectacle made vulgar by emphasis on size . " He praises Minnelli 's talent for " the delicious amorality of the anecdote , but also the honesty and irony of its telling which have become foreign to the American cinema . " Vaughan points out " Chevalier 's practiced but irresistible charm as one of the film 's greatest assets " as well as " the brilliant high-comedy playing of Isabel Jeans , who as Aunt Alicia consummately portrays the distinction and beauty of a retired aristocrat of the '' demimonde '' . " Bosley Crowther of '' The New York Times '' called it " a musical film that bears such a basic resemblance to '' My Fair Lady '' that the authors may want to sue themselves " . He added , " But do n't think this point of resemblance is made in criticism of the film , for '' Gigi '' is a charming entertainment that can stand on its own two legs . It is not only a charming comprehension of the spicy confection of Colette , but it is also a lovely and lyrical enlargement upon that story 's flavored mood and atmosphere … Vincente Minnelli has marshaled a cast to give a set of performances that , for quality and harmony , are superb . " Abel Green of '' Variety '' called the film " 100 % escapist fare " and predicted it " is destined for a global box-office mop-up " . He added , " Alan Jay Lerner 's libretto is tailor-made for an inspired casting job for all principals , and Fritz Loewe 's tunes ( to Lerner 's lyrics ) already vie with and suggest their memorable '' My Fair Lady '' score … Miss Caron is completely captivating and convincing in the title role … Skillful casting , performance and presentation have endowed realism to the sum total … Director Minnelli 's good taste in keeping it in bounds and the general sound judgment of all concerned … distinguishes this Arthur Freed independent production . The Metrocolor rates recognition for its soft pastels under Joseph Ruttenberg 's lensing ; the Beaton costumes , sets and general production design are vivid physical assets at first sight . The skillful integration of words-and-music with the plot motivation makes this '' Gigi '' a very fair lady indeed as a boxoffice entry . " '' Time Out New York '' said , " The dominating creative contribution comes from Minnelli and Cecil Beaton … The combination of these two visual elitists is really too much — it 's like a meal consisting of cheesecake , and one quickly longs for something solid and vulgar to weigh things down . No doubt inspired by the finicky , claustrophobic sets and bric-à-brac , the cast tries ( with unfortunate success ) to be more French than the French , especially Chevalier . The exception is Gingold , who inhabits , as always , a world of her own . " '' TV Guide '' rated the film 3 ½ out of five stars , calling it " Overbaked but enjoyable , and a banquet for the eyes , thanks to the visual wonder of the Minnelli-Beaton teaming … Caron … leads the cast in a contest to see who can be the most French . The winner is Chevalier , in a performance that makes one feel as if you 're gagging on pastry … Perhaps if the sweetness of '' Gigi '' was contrasted with elements of honest vulgarity , the picture could balance itself out … Ten minutes into the movie , you 've resolved the plot and are left to wallow in lovely frou-frou . The film makes wonderful use of the usual Parisian landmarks , and benefits from extraordinary period costumes and sets . " '' Gigi '' won a record-breaking nine Academy Awards ( at the 1959 Oscars ceremony ) ; however , this record only lasted for one year , as '' Ben-Hur '' broke this record the following year with 11 Oscars . In tribute to '' Gigi '' s domination of the Oscars , the MGM switchboard answered calls the following day with " M-Gigi-M " . '' Gigi '' , eventually along with 1987 's '' The Last Emperor '' , held the record as the film ( s ) with the most Academy Award wins in every category in which it was nominated , until 2003 's '' The Lord of the Rings : The Return of the King '' broke the record at the 2004 Oscars ceremony with 11 Oscar nominations and 11 Oscar wins

		CONTEXT=Later in New York , Bourne calls Landy ; she thanks him for the tape , reveals to him his original name , David Webb , and date of birth , and asks him to meet her . Bourne says , " Get some rest , Pam . You look tired . " There were no plans to make a sequel to '' The Bourne Identity '' ( 2002 ) when it was conceived . Matt Damon commented , " When '' The Bourne Identity '' came out I said , ' There is very little chance we will do a second film , just because nobody on the team who made the first wants to make another movie if it ca n't be as good as , or better than , the first one . According to producer Frank Marshall , the plot for the sequel was not based on the novel '' The Bourne Supremacy '' but also by Bourne 's threat in the first film to come after the CIA if it targeted him . Producer Paul L. Sandberg felt that screenwriter Tony Gilroy 's deviating so much from the book was necessary " because so much of the world has changed " since 1986 , when the sequel was first published . Marshall said that Gilroy thought of an idea that Bourne " would go on what amounts to the samurai 's journey , this journey of atonement . " The producers replaced Doug Liman , who directed '' The Bourne Identity '' . This was mainly due to the difficulties Liman had with the studio when making the first film , and their unwillingness to work with him again . British director Paul Greengrass was selected to direct the film after the producers saw '' Bloody Sunday '' ( 2002 ) , Greengrass ' depiction of the Bloody Sunday shootings in Northern Ireland , at Gilroy 's suggestion . Producer Patrick Crowley liked Greengrass ' " sense of the camera as participatory viewer " , a visual style Crowley thought would work well for '' The Bourne Supremacy '' . The film was shot in reverse order of its settings : some portions of the car chase and the film 's ending were shot in Moscow , then most of the rest of the film was shot in and around Berlin , and the opening scenes in Goa were filmed last

		CONTEXT=Prior to Chomanan , Thanin Kraivixien administration had spiraled the country into a perilous state of civil war . Incidents of the Communist Party of Thailand ( CPT ) increasingly sabotages activities in rural areas across all of Thailand and of border clashes with Cambodia and Laos incidents frequent the news headlines . The administration forceful suppressive policy actually helped emboldened the CPT ’s popularity amongst the population . Furthermore , members and close aides of the royal family also became targets of attacks by the communist insurgents , as recorded in the assault of a helicopter assassinating the queen ’s secretary and a bomb explosion in same vicinity as the king while he was visiting the south of Thailand . The country-wide deterioration and increase activities of communist incidents induced actions among the Thai armed forces . The first attempt to overthrow the Thanin administration was led by General Chalad Hiranyasiri and took place in March 1977 where the coup was unsuccessful and Chalad was executed on Thanin 's order . With increasing unrest , the Thanin government was successfully overthrew when a group of Thai military called Young Turks asked the 1976 coup leader ( the coup that ousted the elected civilian government of Seni Pramoj and appointed the current royal favorite Thanin Kraivichien as prime minister ) General Sa-ngad Chaloyu and the Supreme Commander General Kriangsak Chomanan to oust Thanin on 20 October 1977 . Chomanan was later appointed as the new Prime Minister by a majority votes through both the National Assembly and the NARC , as a new Prime Minister has not yet been selected or volunteered . 8 As Prime Minister , Kriangsak moved to modurate and neutralize his predecessor Thanin Kraivichien 's severe measures , which had driven young Thai intellectuals from multiple universities to join Communist insurgencies in the countryside . In 1978 , in a major risk to his political position with his right leaning supporting base , he submitted an amnesty bill to the National Legislative Assembly to release the leftist students and labor activist Bangkok 18 , deemed to be wrongly jailed in 1976 , in the Thammasat University Massacre . The move have greatly bolstered his international position as a South East Asian humanitarian leader as noted by commemoration from many international bodies such as that expressed by letter of congratulations from US President Jimmy Carter and Assistant Secretary of State Patricia Derian , Chief State Department official responsible for human rights and humanitarian affairs . He also started a successful amnesty program for Communists as part of a reconciliation policy . 1 As Prime Minister , Kriangsak is widely credited for defusing a long-running communist insurgency in northern Thailand . He is reported to have met in 1979 with Deng Xiaoping , then supreme leader of the People 's Republic of China , allowing China to ship arms to the rebel Khmer Rouge in Cambodia in exchange for the PRC withdrawing its support for the communist insurgency in Thailand . These reports were confirmed contemporaneously by the Sunday Times and wire services . However , claims of a deal involving the Khmer Rouge was denied by the Thai government , which cites his offer of amnesty as the primary reason for the withdrawal of communist insurgency and policy of reunifications . The other benefit of the deal with China for Thailand was that it would not have Vietnamese troops on its border . In the same way Kriangsak had secret deals with rebel armies across the border in Burma , which provided a buffer zone against Burmese aggression

		CONTEXT=Although Greece had been granted a spot in the 2008 final because of its seventh-place finish at the Eurovision Song Contest 2007 , it had to compete in a semi-final for the first time since 2004 because of new rules put into effect by the European Broadcasting Union ( EBU ) . In previous years , countries that received a top 10 placing were automatically granted a spot in the next year 's final without having to compete in a semi-final , but for 2008 , the EBU changed the automatic qualification regulations so that all countries except the " Big 4 " ( France , Germany , Spain , and the United Kingdom ) and host country , would have to pass through one of two semi-finals . The EBU split up countries with a friendly voting history into separate semi-finals , to give a better chance for other countries to win . Greece and Cyprus had often been accused of favoring each other , with each awarding the other the maximum number of points ( twelve ) at the previous contest . On January 28 , 2008 , the EBU held a special draw which determined that Greece would be in '' Semi-final 1 '' held on May 20 , 2008 in Belgrade , Serbia ; Cyprus was subsequently placed in the second semi-final

		CONTEXT=Crispi was replaced as prime minister by Antonio Di Rudinì in February 1891 , who was succeeded by Giovanni Giolitti in May 1892 . On January 20 , 1893 , when peasants of Caltavuturo occupied communal land that they claimed was theirs , local authorities killed 13 and wounded 21 in the Caltavuturo massacre . Disturbances continued throughout the year . The Fasci started out as urban movements , animated by artisans , which evolved into a more popular and combative mass movement with the adherence of sulphur miners , and in a later stage with the involvement of peasants and sharecroppers . In the autumn of 1893 , labour conflicts in the cities and the mines came together with the protests and claims of the farmers . The movement reached its greatest breadth in the manifestations against taxes , involving the lowest tiers of the city and the countryside , becoming difficult , if not impossible , to control by its leaders

Already since the early summer of 1943 , German troops had been pouring into Greece , fearing an Allied landing there ( in fact falling victims to a grand-scale Allied strategic deception operation , " Operation Barclay " ) . Soon they became involved in wide-ranging counterguerrilla operations , which they carried out with great ruthlessness , based on their experiences in Yugoslavia . In the course of these operations , mass reprisals were carried out , resulting in war crimes such as at Kommeno on August 16 , the Massacre of Kalavryta in December and the Massacre of Distomo in June 1944 . At the same time , hundreds of villages were systematically torched and almost one million people left homeless

In the interview , the former Ruthless and Death Row Records artist ponders her and Dre 's abusive relationship and she states that she was aware she was not included in the '' Straight Outta Compton '' film . " Why would Dre put me in it ? I mean 'cause if they start from where they start from I was just a quiet girlfriend who got beat up and told to shut up . " On August 18 , 2015 , Gawker published an editorial by Dee Barnes titled " Here 's What 's Missing From Straight Outta Compton : Me and the Other Women Dr. Dre Beat Up " . Barnes notes that Dr. Dre had repeated instances of physical abuse to female associates during his time in N.W.A , to include the infamous January 1991 beating of Barnes in the bathroom of Po Na Na Souk nightclub . In the film , the incidents were never acknowledged . She further notes that important women from the era with close and historically important ties to N.W.A ( JJ Fad , Yo Yo , Tairrie B , etc. ) were absent from the film .

QUERY_CONTEXT=" Motivation " is a R&B slow jam song written by Richard Butler ( Rico Love ) , Jim Jonsin , Dwayne Carter and Danny Morris . The racy lyrics center around Rowland asking her man to use his hands all over her body , and are accompanied by a " synth-saturated beat " produced by Jonsin . In terms of instruments , " Motivation " uses sparse keyboard notes , programmed beats and pulsing synths in the chorus . Wayne adds a rap verse complementing Rowland 's seductive suggestions , using the kitchen and a car as metaphors for sex . According to Scott Shetler from AOL Music , Rowland uses the lyrics to promise " to be her lover 's motivation . " Rowland called the record a mixture between dance and mash-up . When asked by MTV what Rowland thought of the song , she said , " It has that personality and characteristic to it that I do n't think anybody can deny . That 's why when Wayne dropped that insane verse on there ... I was like , ' You really brought that up even more . ' He went into the studio and just did it . I do n't think it takes much for Wayne to think . He just does it . He 's so admirable . " Ryan Brockington , from the '' New York Post , '' was amongst the first to review " Motivation . " In his review , he said " The single is a big leap from the dance club synth pop that Kelly has been releasing the past year and it seems like she might be trying to shimmy her way back into the hip-hop world by teaming up with the Midas touch vocals of Lil Wayne . " Both '' Rap-Up '' and AOL Music 's Scott Shetler called the song " sexy . " Becky Bain from Idolator disliked the song for not being memorable . The short review was summed up with the closing phrase , " she ’s going to need another hit to help promote her album when it finally is ready to drop . " Wesley Case from '' The Baltimore Sun '' complemented the song 's sexy quality . " If this is n't the year 's hands-down sexiest song thus far , it has to be in the discussion . Rowland , whose sultry voice could get a priest hot , weaving in and out of the minimal beat , and setting the table for Lil Wayne 's stuttering , after-hours guest-verse .

QUERY_ANSWERS={'were massacred', 'Mudan incident'}
QUERY_CONTEXT=And Japan was eager to take every opportunity . In 1869 they took advantage of the defeat of the rebels of the Republic of Ezo to incorporate definitely the island of Hokkaido to Japan . For centuries , Japan viewed the Ryukyu Islands as one of its provinces . In 1871 the Mudan incident happened : cannibal Taiwanese aborigines murdered 54 Ryūkyūan sailors that had their ship shipwrecked . At that time the Ryukyu Islands were claimed by both Qing China and Japan , and the Japanese interpreted the incident as an attack on their citizens . They took steps to bring the islands in their jurisdiction : in 1872 the Japanese Ryukyu Domain was declared , and in 1874 a retaliatory incursion to Taiwan was sent , which was a success . The success of this expedition emboldened the Japanese : not even the Americans could defeat the Taiwanese cannibals in the Formosa Expedition of 1867 . Very few gave it much thought at the time , but this was the first move in the Japanese expansionism series . Japan occupied Taiwan for the rest of 1874 and then left owing to Chinese pressures , but in 1879 it finally annexed the Ryukyu Islands . In 1875 Qing China sent a 300-men force to subdue the Taiwanese cannibals , but unlike the Japanese the Chinese were routed , ambushed and 250 of their men were killed ; the failure of this expedition exposed once more the failure of Qing China to exert effective control in Taiwan , and acted as another incentive for the Japanese to annex Taiwan . Eventually , the spoils for winning the First Sino-Japanese War in 1894 included Taiwan

		CONTEXT=Wasilewska at times favoured incorporation of Poland into the Soviet Union as a republic . She explained away Stalin 's deadly purges by arguing that death of an innocent person was preferable to the risk of demise of the Soviet Union . The persecutions and victims , she felt , were an unavoidable cost of future progress or resulted from licentious conduct by functionaries . She intervened when Poles whom she knew were deported to distant regions of the Soviet Union and engaged in relief activities , such as sending parcels to deportees . Wasilewska 's interventions freed her fellow Polish communists ( kept in detention by Lavrentiy Beria even after the official amnesty for Poles negotiated by the government of Władysław Sikorski ) , the poet Broniewski and his by then estranged wife Janina Broniewska . Broniewska , who went to Moscow and worked for '' Nowe Widnokręgi '' , took care of Wasilewska'a daughter Ewa during Wasilewska 's lengthy involvement at the German front . When the Polish People 's Army was formed , Wasilewska and Broniewska pushed for the use as an emblem on soldier uniforms and elsewhere of a crownless Piast eagle taken from the restored sarcophagus of Bolesław III Wrymouth , a medieval ruler of Poland . The crownless eagle , contrary to the previously and historically used eagle with a crown , was accepted for the army and remained in exclusive use as the coat of arms of Poland throughout the period of existence of the Polish People 's Republic ( 1945 – 89 )

		CONTEXT=Regarding the neo-Nazi Admiral Duncan pub bombing in 1999 by David Copeland , Murray wrote in the '' Morning Star '' : " Everything about this episode strikes me as odd . It happened during a war i.e. the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia that is not going particularly well " , and alleged that some neo-Nazi groups " may very well have been established with MI5 or Special Branch connivance . And certainly the state — or groups within the security apparatus — is more than capable of manipulating deranged human-haters without the latter even noticing that they are being manipulated . " Murray told '' The Times '' in 2019 : " As I wrote at the time my speculations were no more than ' conjecture and supposition ' . There is no basis for any suggestion that the bombing of the Admiral Duncan was the responsibility of anyone other than David Copeland . " Murray is considered an apologist for Joseph Stalin by his critics , such as Nick Cohen . Described as an " admirer " in '' The Independent on Sunday '' in 2003 , in 1999 he wrote in his '' Morning Star '' column : In 1999 , Murray said of KGB spy Melita Norwood : " She herself says that she has no regrets and I do not see why she should . She took advantage of the position that she was in to give her side a bit of help in the international class struggle . The strength of the Soviet Union was a huge factor in favour of world peace , something which has become more obvious in its absence today . Those who contributed , however slightly , to that strength did all of us a service . " When asked about these comments by '' The Times '' in 2019 , he said " The Cold War is over . I would under no circumstances condone anyone acting as Melita Norwood did today . " In 2008 , Murray identified " one of the successes " of the " nationalities policy of the Soviet Union " as being the promotion of " the cultural , linguistic and educational development of each ethnic group , no matter how small or how historically marginalised . " This comment was criticised by author Edward Lucas in '' The Guardian '' who accused Murray of ignoring " the Chechens , Crimean Tatars and other victims of Stalin 's murderous deportation policies . " In a short history of the CPGB , published in 1995 , Murray wrote : " That things happened in the USSR which were inexcusable and which ultimately prejudiced Socialism ’s whole prospect is today undeniable . Whether Communists in the capitalist world could or should have done more than they did is much more contentious " . Oliver Kamm , in '' The Times '' commented in 2016 : " In short , Mr Murray believes that British communists in the 1930s were justified in backing the Great Terror , the Moscow Trials and the Ukraine famine . Mr Murray predictably supports the most nightmarish totalitarian state in the modern world " .

		CONTEXT=In Lebanon , Hassan Nasrallah , the leader of Hezbollah , used the occasion to call for popular resistance to replace the regimes in the Middle East with regimes that are ' convinced of war in order to send their armies to war . ' At the 2010 Quds Day rally in Tehran , Iranian President Ahmadinejad again predicted the demise of Israel , stating , " If the leaders of the region do not have the guts , then the people of the region are capable of removing the Zionist regime from the world scene . " He dismissed any Israeli military threat to Iran 's nuclear program , declaring , " The Zionist regime is nothing and even its ( Western ) masters are too small to conduct any kind of aggression against Iran and the rights of the Iranian people . " Ahmadinejad also proclaimed new peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians as " stillborn and doomed . " The tens of thousands of Iranians participating in the rallies continued the regular chants of " Death to America ! Death to Israel ! " The day before the rallies , Ayatollah Khamenei tweeted , " Israel Is A Hideous Entity In the Middle East Which Will Undoubtedly Be Annihilated . " In Lebanon , the day after the resumption of direct peace negotiations between Israel and Palestine , Hassan Nasrallah , Hezbollah secretary-general , declared that : Our nation can not ignore and forget this cause ( al-Quds ) because it is part of our religion , our religious commitment , our culture , our civilization , our morals and values and our past history . ... No one has the right to give up one span of its land , one grain of its sacred sand , one drop of its water , or one letter of its name . Al Quds Day is the day for announcing this ideological , legal , historic true constant position . On this day we make the announcement that neither al-Quds nor even one of its streets nor even a neighbourhood of its neighbourhoods – and not only all of al-Quds - may be an eternal capital for the so called state of Israel . Al Quds is the capital of Palestine , and as we have said in the past , it is the capital of earth and the capital of heaven one way or another . ' In Quetta , Pakistan , a suicide bomber attacked Pakistani Shias holding a Quds Day rally . The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack , which killed at least 65 people and wounded 160

		CONTEXT=In early 2013 , Gosling announced that he was taking a break from acting , stating , " I 've lost perspective on what I 'm doing . I think it 's good for me to take a break and reassess why I 'm doing it and how I 'm doing it . And I think this is probably a good way to learn about that . " Gosling 's directorial debut '' Lost River '' competed in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival . The " fantasy noir " , written by Gosling , stars Christina Hendricks , Ben Mendelsohn , and Matt Smith . The film received largely unfavorable reviews . Peter Bradshaw of '' The Guardian '' found it " insufferably conceited " and remarked that Gosling had lost " any sense of proportion or humility . " Robbie Collin of '' The Telegraph '' described '' Lost River '' as " mind-bogglingly pleased with itself " , while '' Variety '' s Justin Chang dismissed the " derivative " film as a " train-wreck . " In 2015 , he played a bond salesman in the ensemble financial satire '' The Big Short '' , a Best Picture nominee at the 2016 Academy Awards .

		CONTEXT=By May 2009 , '' The Tree of Life '' had been sold to a number of international distributors , including Europacorp in France , TriPictures in Spain , and Icon in the UK and Australia , but lacked a US distributor .

A tentative date of December 25 , 2009 was announced , but the film was not completed in time . Organisers of the Cannes Film Festival made negotiations to secure a premiere at Cannes 2010 , resulting in Malick sending an early version of the film to Thierry Fremaux and the Cannes selection committee . Though Fremaux warmly received the cut and was eager to screen the film at his festival , Malick ultimately told him that he felt the film was not ready . On the eve of the 2010 Cannes Film Festival , Berney suddenly announced his departure from Apparition , leaving the company 's future uncertain . Pohlad decided to keep '' The Tree of Life '' at Apparition , and after significant restructuring , hired Tom Ortenberg to act as a consultant on its release . A tentative plan was made to release it in late 2010 , in time for awards consideration . Ultimately , Pohlad decided to close Apparition and sell rights to the film . Private screenings of the film to interested parties Fox Searchlight Pictures and Sony Pictures Classics took place at the 2010 Telluride Film Festival .
