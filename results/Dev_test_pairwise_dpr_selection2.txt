QUERY_ANSWERS={'massive flood', '1977 flood', 'Johnstown Flood of 1977'}
QUERY_CONTEXT=The flood was preceded by rains from March 9 that did not stop until March 22 , 1936 . The storms brought warmer 50 °F ( 10 °C ) weather that was a cause of one stage of flooding and the continuous rains a second cause of flooding . The natural run-off of 1 to 3 inches ( 2.5 to 7.5 cm ) was far surpassed by the deluge of from 10 to 30 inches ( 25 to 75 cm ) of water in the region . The flood came before pending flood control legislation was enacted or any significant flood control measures implemented . The narrowness of the valleys and encroachment of buildings on the river banks contributed to record flooding . By the time nightfall came one-third of the city was under of water and by the time flooding was over twenty-five people lost their lives . The damages , estimated at $ 43 million , made it the worst flood since the flood of 1889 and the event is chronicled at the Johnstown Flood Museum After the flood , sweeping nationwide flood control laws were enacted and from 1938 to 1943 Johnstown saw many projects completed . These measures gave the people the feeling that the area was now " flood free " , and it was touted as such until the flood of 1977

		CONTEXT=In 1977 the Board of Governors of the World Bank approved Bura Irrigation and Settlement Project ( BISP ) in Kenya . The project area is situated just South of the Equator in the Lower Tana Basin . It lies on the west bank of the Tana River and falls within the administrative area of Tana River County . The project was an ambitious attempt of the government of Kenya , the World Bank and a few other donors to develop a remote area , create employment for thousands of people with a reasonable income and earn foreign exchange . Bura project would develop about 6,700 net irrigated ha over a 5 1/2 year period and settle on smallholdings about 5,150 landless poor families selected from all parts of Kenya . Physical and social infrastructure would be provided to support the settler and satellite population , expected to reach a total of 65,000 persons by 1985 . The total cost of the project was estimated at 92 million dollars in 1977 prices . Actual construction started in 1978 . During implementation the costs exploded from $ 17,500 / = per family to $ 55,000 / = , a new record for the World Bank . The largest cost increase was for the irrigation network ( 615 % ) . The donors were not willing and the government was not able to raise the additional funds and subsequently the size of the project was scaled down from 6,700 ha to 3,900 and later to 2,500 ha , although the irrigation structures were completed for 6,700 ha . In this period 2,100 landless households from all over Kenya were settled in the scheme . They were allocated two plots of 0.625 ha and a garden of 0.05 ha . Each year they were to grow 1.25 ha cotton and 0.625 maize intercropped with cowpeas . Soon it was evident that the project would fail to achieve its objectives . Job creation was only 40 % of the target , the economic rate of return was negative and the annual operating and maintenance costs exceeded the benefits . Even with net farm incomes of about 40 % of the appraisal estimates in real terms , annual government subsidies amounted to about 1,000 dollars per settler . The project had an unreliable water supply and many buildings had foundation problems . After cotton crop failures due to pests in 1990 the project came virtually to a standstill as the management lacked the funds to finance cotton and maize crops . Most settlers deserted and the only the ones with nowhere to go remained in the scheme , living on famine relief and odd jobs . In the period 1993 - 2005 a number of times the government tried to revive a number of timesthe project , but all in vain . After 2005 , rehabilitation and crop growing started in phases and since 2009 - 10 the tenants have been growing crops , although the cropping pattern comed down to no more than 50 % of the projected crop intensity and the settlers have low incomes , if any . This is partly caused by the fact that the original cash crop , cotton , is no longer a profitable crop .

		CONTEXT=In a May 2005 column in the '' Weekly Standard '' , Daveed Gartenstein-Ross wrote about his May 14 , 2005 , debate with Bray on PAX-TV 's Faith Under Fire program . He noted that a '' Chicago Tribune '' article had detailed how the fundamentalist Islamist Muslim Brotherhood operates in the US through MAS , and that MAS wants to see the US governed by sharia law . He noted that MAS , " except in its most public of statements " , was open about its agenda . He argued that while Bray " tries to portray MAS as an organization that embraces these shared liberal democratic values , the group simultaneously teaches its members that all government should become Islamic and that non-Islamic judicial systems should be boycotted . " In July 2005 , after the London bombings that killed 52 people , Bray said : " Let me say to the terrorists very clearly , that you will have no comfort in our community . Our community offers you no harbor . Our message is clear , you do no service to Islam , you do a great disservice to Islam and for the love of God , stop this madness . " When the '' Philadelphia Inquirer '' published some of the cartoons of Mohammed in the 2005 Mohammed cartoons controversy , Bray said : " This has nothing to do with free speech ; its pure sensationalism that reeks of religious disrespect . What the '' Philadelphia Inquirer '' has done is irresponsible , provocative , and reckless . " When in November 2006 , two imams from Boston-area mosques were arrested and charged with being involved in a scheme that secured religious worker visas for immigrants who instead got secular jobs , Bray said : " If this was sic clerics who were anything other than Muslims , would they have had to face this ? " After the September 2007 resignation of Esam Omeish from a Virginia Commission on Immigration , after it was revealed that he had publicly endorsed " the jihad way " in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict , Bray said " What 's the big news ? Everybody knows Muslims feel passionately about the Palestinian issue . What in the world is wrong about talking about the invasion of Lebanon or the plight of the Palestinian people ? " Bray served on the Board of Directors of the Interfaith Alliance and the National Interfaith Committee for Worker Justice , and is a National Co-convener of Religions for Peace-USA . He is a Washington , DC , television and radio talk show host , and has appeared on CBS News , Fox , MSNBC , CNN , C-SPAN , Aljazeera , and many TV and radio talk shows . Bray also organized protests against the U.S. war in Afghanistan , the Iraq war , and the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza

		CONTEXT=In October 2015 , '' Nature Biotechnology '' wrote that scientists like Folta have been " targeted because they speak inconvenient truths about GM technology " and stated that the funds " were tied neither to Folta directly nor to his research . His conflict of interest disclosures were wholly compliant with his university 's rules . He never used industry funds for personal gain . " The journal criticized the journalists for " cherry-picking " and creating " hostile environments for scientists that threaten vibrant rare species with extinction . " Many experts were highly critical of the move by USRTK . Jack Payne , head of the University of Florida 's Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences , characterized this as an example of activist groups attempting to silence scientists who wish to engage in public discussion of politically controversial topics , describing it as a " spiral of silence " . Gretchen Goldman , writing for the Union of Concerned Scientists ( UCS ) , a nonprofit science advocacy organization , criticized the FOIA requests for being " overly wide " , saying it would create " chilling effects on researchers and confuse the public about the state of the science . " Nina Fedoroff , Peter Raven , and Phillip Sharp , three former presidents of the American Association for the Advancement of Science , wrote in '' The Guardian '' comparing the USRTK 's use of FOIA against scientists to " Climategate " and criticized the organization backing them for " promoting the interests of the organic food business " , calling their activities " anti-science " . Ralph Nader expressed support for the use of FOIA requests on scientists , calling them " appropriate subjects "

		CONTEXT=Since the early 2000s , Sinai has been the site of several terror attacks against tourists , the majority of whom are Egyptian . Investigations have shown that these were mainly motivated by a resentment of the poverty faced by many Bedouin in the area . Attacking the tourist industry was viewed as a method of damaging the industry so that the government would pay more attention to their situation . ( See 2004 Sinai bombings , 2005 Sharm El Sheikh bombings and 2006 Dahab bombings ) . Since the 2011 Egyptian Revolution , unrest has become more prevalent in the area including the 2012 Egyptian-Israeli border attack in which 16 Egyptian soldiers were killed by militants . ( See Sinai insurgency . ) Also on the rise are kidnappings of refugees . According to Meron Estifanos , Eritrean refugees are often kidnapped by Bedouin in the northern Sinai , tortured , raped , and only released after receiving a large ransom

QUERY_CONTEXT=Since the early 2000s , Sinai has been the site of several terror attacks against tourists , the majority of whom are Egyptian . Investigations have shown that these were mainly motivated by a resentment of the poverty faced by many Bedouin in the area . Attacking the tourist industry was viewed as a method of damaging the industry so that the government would pay more attention to their situation . ( See 2004 Sinai bombings , 2005 Sharm El Sheikh bombings and 2006 Dahab bombings ) . Since the 2011 Egyptian Revolution , unrest has become more prevalent in the area including the 2012 Egyptian-Israeli border attack in which 16 Egyptian soldiers were killed by militants . ( See Sinai insurgency . ) Also on the rise are kidnappings of refugees .

QUERY_ANSWERS={'76th ceremony', '2004 Academy Awards', 'Academy Awards', '76th Academy Awards', "previous year 's ceremony"}
QUERY_CONTEXT=In the 1959 review for '' Sight & Sound '' , David Vaughan calls '' Gigi '' " an elegant film " with a " cultivated visual taste which is everywhere apparent " . He summarises that " while '' Gigi '' does not represent a revival of the MGM musical in its heyday , it is a welcome extension of latter-day musical style in its adult subject-matter and its avoidance of spectacle made vulgar by emphasis on size . " He praises Minnelli 's talent for " the delicious amorality of the anecdote , but also the honesty and irony of its telling which have become foreign to the American cinema . " Vaughan points out " Chevalier 's practiced but irresistible charm as one of the film 's greatest assets " as well as " the brilliant high-comedy playing of Isabel Jeans , who as Aunt Alicia consummately portrays the distinction and beauty of a retired aristocrat of the '' demimonde '' . " Bosley Crowther of '' The New York Times '' called it " a musical film that bears such a basic resemblance to '' My Fair Lady '' that the authors may want to sue themselves " . He added , " But do n't think this point of resemblance is made in criticism of the film , for '' Gigi '' is a charming entertainment that can stand on its own two legs . It is not only a charming comprehension of the spicy confection of Colette , but it is also a lovely and lyrical enlargement upon that story 's flavored mood and atmosphere … Vincente Minnelli has marshaled a cast to give a set of performances that , for quality and harmony , are superb . " Abel Green of '' Variety '' called the film " 100 % escapist fare " and predicted it " is destined for a global box-office mop-up " . He added , " Alan Jay Lerner 's libretto is tailor-made for an inspired casting job for all principals , and Fritz Loewe 's tunes ( to Lerner 's lyrics ) already vie with and suggest their memorable '' My Fair Lady '' score … Miss Caron is completely captivating and convincing in the title role … Skillful casting , performance and presentation have endowed realism to the sum total … Director Minnelli 's good taste in keeping it in bounds and the general sound judgment of all concerned … distinguishes this Arthur Freed independent production . The Metrocolor rates recognition for its soft pastels under Joseph Ruttenberg 's lensing ; the Beaton costumes , sets and general production design are vivid physical assets at first sight . The skillful integration of words-and-music with the plot motivation makes this '' Gigi '' a very fair lady indeed as a boxoffice entry . " '' Time Out New York '' said , " The dominating creative contribution comes from Minnelli and Cecil Beaton … The combination of these two visual elitists is really too much — it 's like a meal consisting of cheesecake , and one quickly longs for something solid and vulgar to weigh things down . No doubt inspired by the finicky , claustrophobic sets and bric-à-brac , the cast tries ( with unfortunate success ) to be more French than the French , especially Chevalier . The exception is Gingold , who inhabits , as always , a world of her own . " '' TV Guide '' rated the film 3 ½ out of five stars , calling it " Overbaked but enjoyable , and a banquet for the eyes , thanks to the visual wonder of the Minnelli-Beaton teaming … Caron … leads the cast in a contest to see who can be the most French . The winner is Chevalier , in a performance that makes one feel as if you 're gagging on pastry … Perhaps if the sweetness of '' Gigi '' was contrasted with elements of honest vulgarity , the picture could balance itself out … Ten minutes into the movie , you 've resolved the plot and are left to wallow in lovely frou-frou . The film makes wonderful use of the usual Parisian landmarks , and benefits from extraordinary period costumes and sets . " '' Gigi '' won a record-breaking nine Academy Awards ( at the 1959 Oscars ceremony ) ; however , this record only lasted for one year , as '' Ben-Hur '' broke this record the following year with 11 Oscars . In tribute to '' Gigi '' s domination of the Oscars , the MGM switchboard answered calls the following day with " M-Gigi-M " . '' Gigi '' , eventually along with 1987 's '' The Last Emperor '' , held the record as the film ( s ) with the most Academy Award wins in every category in which it was nominated , until 2003 's '' The Lord of the Rings : The Return of the King '' broke the record at the 2004 Oscars ceremony with 11 Oscar nominations and 11 Oscar wins

		CONTEXT=In 2009 , Delpy starred in '' The Countess '' , also her third film as a director in which she played the title role of Elizabeth Báthory . The film also starred Daniel Brühl , and William Hurt . In 2011 Delpy wrote and directed '' Le Skylab '' . The film received a theatrical release in France , but failed to find distribution in the U.S . In 2012 she released '' 2 Days in New York '' , a sequel to her 2007 film '' 2 Days in Paris '' . The film starred Delpy and actor Chris Rock . Delpy stated that she wrote the role specifically for Rock . In 2013 , Delpy reunited with Richard Linklater and Ethan Hawke to write '' Before Midnight '' , the sequel to '' Before Sunrise '' and '' Before Sunset '' . Delpy again starred with Hawke , and the film premiered at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival . It went on to screen out of competition at the Berlin International Film Festival and was released in May 2013 . Delpy was later nominated for a Best Adapted Screenplay at the Academy Awards alongside Richard Linklater and Ethan Hawke . Responding to criticism regarding the nudity in the film in an interview with GQ Magazine , Delpy remarked : Some people were like , ' it 's not feminist . You 're showing your tits and he 's not showing his ass . ' But is n't it the people who are hiding women behind layers of clothes who are the misogynists ? I 'm a real person , so it 's a statement to say , ' Alright , I 'm a forty year-old woman , and this is what you get with no plastic surgery . ' '' Lolo '' was Delpy 's second French-language feature film . It was also the first film she directed since '' 2 Days in New York '' . She has also written and directed the HBO movie '' Cancer Vixen '' , starring Cate Blanchett as Marisa Acocella Marchetto , a cartoonist for '' The New Yorker '' who is diagnosed with cancer . In early 2014 Delpy announced her next writing-directing project would be called '' A Dazzling Display of Splendor '' and focus on a family of vaudeville performers

		CONTEXT=In 1968 , Paramount Pictures released the film '' The Brotherhood '' starring Kirk Douglas as a mafia don , which was a financial flop . Nevertheless , Paramount 's production chief Robert Evans subsidized the completion of a Mario Puzo novel with similar themes and plot elements , and bought the screen rights '' before '' completion . Directed by Francis Ford Coppola , '' The Godfather '' became a huge success , both critically and financially ( it won the Best Picture Oscar and for a year was the highest-grossing film ever made ) . It immediately inspired other mafia-related films , including a direct sequel , '' The Godfather Part II '' ( 1974 ) , also ( partly ) based on Puzo 's novel , and yet another big winner at the Academy Awards , as well as films based on real Mafiosi like '' Honor Thy Father '' and '' Lucky Luciano '' ( both in 1973 ) and '' Lepke '' and '' Capone '' ( both in 1975 ) . An ambitious 13-part miniseries by NBC called '' The Gangster Chronicles '' based on the rise of many major crime bosses of the 1920s and 1930s , aired in 1981 . '' The Sopranos '' was an award-winning HBO television show that depicted modern day American-Italian mob culture in New Jersey . Although the show is fictional , the general storyline is based on its creator David Chase ’s experiences growing up and interacting with New Jersey crime families . Ex-members of the Mafia came together in '' Inside the American Mob '' documentary where they spoke about the different rules of the five families , and how they remained virtually untouchable for quite some time . The documentary also features the Mob 's decline over time due to infiltration by the FBI

		CONTEXT=Reviews of the film were overwhelmingly positive . It has received a 95 % rating on Rotten Tomatoes ( 93 Fresh and 5 Rotten ) and 100 % rating from designated top critics . The critical consensus called it " an immersive , gorgeously shot tribute to the people who express life through movement . " Roger Ebert gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars and A. O. Scott of the New York Times was similarly enthusiastic , saying " '' Choreography is a notoriously perishable art . Dances often struggle to outlive their creators . And “ Pina ” is , above all , an act of preservation , a memorial that is also a defiance of mortality — completely alive in every dimension . " '' Kimberley Jones of the Austin Chronicle praised the " utterly transfixing , exhilarating spectacle of bodies in motion . " '' Pina '' was selected as the German entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 84th Academy Awards and was submitted for Best Documentary Feature . On 18 November 2011 , the film was named as one of the 15 shortlisted entries for Best Documentary Feature . On 18 January 2012 , the film was also named as one of the nine shortlisted entries for Best Foreign Language Film . On 24 January 2012 it was finally nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature , but failed to be nominated in the Best Foreign Language Film category . Had the film received Oscar nominations in both fields , it would have been the first film ever to do so

The book is believed to have been inspired by the village of Farsa , just outside Argostoli . The love story comprising the theme of the book is set before and after the Acqui Division massacre , during the Second World War . A film adaptation was released in 2001 . During filming there was lively debate between the production team , local authorities as well as groups of citizens , as to the complex historical details of the island 's antifascist resistance . As a result , political references were omitted from the film , and the romantic core of the book was preserved , without entering complex debates about the island 's history . In 2005 , Riccardo Milani made his TV movie , '' Cefalonia '' , also about the massacre , with music by Ennio Morricone

		CONTEXT=Critical opinion regarding the film has been overwhelmingly positive . '' The Village Voice '' critic J. Hoberman , who in 1981 included the film in his list of the ten best films commercially released in the United States during that year , more recently wrote that the film is one " of the richest avant-garde features of the 1970s " and praised its " winning combination of sexual frankness and visual wit , " while another critic , Dennis Schwartz , wrote that the " film 's beauty is derived from its sexual frankness and playfully drawn out intimate relationship scenes , witty use of photography , and its originality as it breaks free of conventional unities of body , space and time . Export skillfully edits montage and integrates video , still photography , and performance art with elements from Cubism , Surrealism , Dada and avant-garde cinema . " '' Artforum '' noted in November 1980 that " w atching their scenes together , we realize how seldom , if ever before , the details of sexual intimacy have been shown in film from the point of view from a woman . Export privileges rupture over unity and never settles for one-dimensional solutions " and it was called one " of the most original films in this year 's exposition " and a " tour de force of cinematic invention " grounded in the director 's " fresh and intelligent sensibility , characteristically self-referential . Her visual resources include mirrors , still photography , video , dance , and films within the film , all employed with a bold and surprising inventiveness " by the catalogue notes of the 1978 Los Angeles International Film Exposition . Similarly , critic Alison Butler wrote that the " film is a witty and visually brilliant essay on gender and experience , culture and environment " and program notes used by the San Francisco Cinematheque during a screening quote critic Amy Taubin as opining that the film " makes you reconsider what you and everyone else is doing — in life and in art " and critic Steve Anker underscoring that it is an important " crossover film " combining " avant-garde and theatrical sensibilities , made during the mid-1970s . It chronicles the nightmarish breakdown of a fashion photographer as she confronts her waning identity and security as a career woman ; blending narrative experimentation , fantasy , fact and theoretical critique , it has enormous impact on independent features which followed it . " PopMatters noted that the film has " enough originality to nag at patient viewers and get at least partially under our skin " and critic Michael Atkinson wrote that it is a " weird , restless , beguilingly offbeat bit of dreamwork . " The film was presented for the first time at the Berlin International Film Festival in 1977 , it has won a Special Jury Prize at the Venice Film Festival and was recently called " seminal " during a screening at a repertory cinema , " a strong and humoristic showdown " at another and " a sonically-complex , montage-rich , darkly funny and uriniferous cornerstone of avant-garde cinema " during a screening at a New York University class . Critic Peter Hajek wrote in the Austrian newspaper '' Kurier '' that " Valie Export presents this psychopanoptic view of the present in solid , striking images and often in unexpected humorous passages . " Critic Chris Holmlund , author of the scholarly article " Feminist Makeovers : The Celluloid Surgery of Valie Export and Su Friedrich , " referred to '' Invisible Adversaries '' as a feminist version of '' Invasion of the Body Snatchers '' , noted that the film includes references to famous paintings and to '' Un Chien Andalou '' , and wrote that therefore it " is visually rick , entertaining , striking , but also demanding . " A few reviews , however , were negative . For example , London 's '' Time Out '' wrote about the film that it is " n ot unlike '' W.R. : Mysteries of the Organism '' " and that it will " probably age as badly " and a reviewer for '' The Heights '' wrote that " I was expecting a great feminist work here , but got mediocrity . I can not recommend that you see this film , " though he nevertheless praised the film as a " cornucopia of video spectacle in which Export delights , confounds and amuses the audience with her antics .

		CONTEXT=, the film holds a rating of 75 % on Rotten Tomatoes based on 28 reviews , with an average rating of 6.47 / 10 . The website 's critical consensus reads : " Abel Ferrara 's 1995 horror/suspense experiment blends urban vampire adventure with philosophical analysis to create a smart , idiosyncratic and undeniably odd take on the genre . " Kevin Thomas of the '' Los Angeles Times '' praised Taylor 's performance , and added : " Although Ferrara dares to be intellectual in a manner virtually unique in commercial American cinema , he nevertheless does n't forget how to entertain in the gory , bravura manner associated with him . Although it undeniably helps , you do n't have to know your Heidegger from Hamburger Helper to enjoy '' The Addiction '' as a grisly yet unusual thriller of the supernatural . " '' The Washington Post '' s Hal Hinson was less laudatory of Taylor 's performance , writing that she " seems less distinctive here than she has been in past roles . " However , he praised Walken 's performance , though summarized the film as " serious and passionate ; Ferrara 's conviction , too , is unquestionable . However , when he flashes images of historic atrocities of both the distant and recent past — Nazi death camps , the war dead in Bosnia — his ideas come across as shallow and banal . Also , inserting scenes of real-life horror into what is essentially a glorified genre exercise may strike some as the essence of bad taste . " Caryn James of '' The New York Times '' expressed a similar sentiment , noting " When the film connects Kathleen 's struggle to resist evil to My Lai and the Holocaust , those comparisons are exploitative in a way that even a genre-bending film ca n't get away with . " Stephen Hunter of '' The Baltimore Sun '' praised Taylor for portraying Kathleen " with dour , sexless intensity , " and deemed the film " far sexier than '' Interview with the Vampire '' and far deadlier than the campy '' Nadja '' ... It 's extremely disturbing , a graduate - level movie for advanced students in either of three subjects : cinema , philosophy and debauchery . " The film was nominated for the Golden Bear award at the 45th Berlin International Film Festival where it won the Blue Angel Award . Lili Taylor won the Sant Jordi Award for Best Foreign Actress . The film received Best Actress ( Taylor ) , Best Film ( Abel Ferrara ) and Special Mention Award ( Walken ) at the Málaga International Week of Fantastic Cinema . The film was nominated for two Independent Spirit Awards and won Critics Award in Mystfest and was also nominated for Best Film . The film received high praise from the critic Peter Bradshaw , who named it as one of his top ten favourite films in a 2002 '' Sight and Sound '' poll

		CONTEXT=This beach is considered by many surfers to be one of the top spots in Costa Rica . It has become famous in part to its ease of access apart from its quality as a surfing wave . Playa Negra has a rock reef bottom with good right-hand barrels and a well defined channel for paddling out . This channel also assists surfers to return to the point where the wave breaks . There is a strong rip current that takes the surfers back through the impact zone . Depending on the swell direction and tides a left breaking wave may also be surfed . The break has good exposure to both Northern and Southern Hemisphere swells and is reasonably consistent year-round . The wave can break well with large and small swells . The 2012 Costa Rica earthquake lifted up the entire plate which caused the wave to have better form on higher tides in combination with smaller swells . It may also produce good surfing waves during the entire tide range . On a lower tide the wave breaks faster and hollower due to the earthquake

Reel Film Reviews gave the film two out of four stars , stating : " Eloise at the Plaza is mildly entertaining , if only because it seems to consist of one caper after another . The film 's structure soon becomes perfectly obvious - Eloise gets into a madcap adventure , adults chase her around , Nanny admonishes her , etc - and the fast pace is clearly in place to keep younger viewers interested . But , though there are a number of talented actors in the cast , Eloise just is n't a compelling enough character to sustain an entire movie . There 's no doubt that the movie will act as wish fulfillment for kids - who would n't want to run amuck and get away with it ? - but when you get right down to it , Eloise is awfully thin and one-dimensional ( not to mention annoying ) . " DVDizzy.com wrote : " The film even ascends beyond the second-tier quality that most television movies are satisfied to achieve . Eloise deserves praise not merely as a more bearable Wonderful World of Disney presentation , but as a genuinely entertaining family film , regardless of format .

Ramachandran retorted , " At no time , have I run seeking position , title and fame . I have the belief that they should come looking for you . " He initially considered returning the award , on account of being criticised for allegedly using political influence to his advantage , but relented when the committee explained its reasons for awarding him .

		SCORE=1.8658160882978336e-07
		CONTEXT=Although filming began in 1987 , the film was released only a year after . It turned out to be a box-office failure but won critical acclaim . Balu Mahendra admitted that he did not expect the film to be a box-office success or a failure , but would have the satisfaction of having made a good film . Archana 's portrayal as a middle-class woman fetched her a lot of accolades from the critics . Chokkalinga Bhagavathar , who played her grandfather , received equal praise . He was a strong contender for that year 's National Film Award for Best Actor , but eventually lost to Kamal Haasan . At the 35th National Film Awards , the film won in two categories – Best Feature Film in Tamil , and Best Actress for Archana . The film was among the 16 films to be screened at the Indian Panorama section of the International Film Festival of India in 1988 . In 2002 , the film was screened at the " Indian Summer " section of the Locarno International Film Festival . In a 2013 review , '' Ananda Vikatan '' called '' Veedu '' to be among the two films that took Tamil cinema to world cinema level . Further , it praised the film for highlighting the plight of Indian middle-class families and the political set up of the nation . It stated '' Veedu '' was one of the few Tamil films that scores good on both content and narration , and also appreciated Balu Mahendra 's directorial skills . Critics praised the film for being more visual and Balu Mahendra 's understanding of cinema as a visual medium . However , the magazine criticised the usage of background score in the film as it felt it lessened the impact of an otherwise good film . S. Theodore Baskaran in his '' The Eye of The Serpent : An Introduction To Tamil Cinema '' states that '' Veedu '' was a " striking departure " from the previous films of Balu Mahendra , as it was devoid of commercial elements like dance , songs , fight and comedy sequences . While analysing Archana 's characterisation , Baskaran noted Balu Mahendra 's penchant for strong characterisation of his female leads . Balu Mahendra had to construct a house which was mean to be a set for the house which was shown in the film . The building which was later fully constructed , now houses the film school started by Balu Mahendra in 2007 . In many interviews , Balu Mahendra had claimed that '' Veedu '' and '' Sandhya Raagam '' were the only films that satisfied him the most as he made these two the least number of mistakes and compromises . The film is widely considered to be one of the finest works of Balu Mahendra . The negative of the film is lost

QUERY_CONTEXT=Although Greece had been granted a spot in the 2008 final because of its seventh-place finish at the Eurovision Song Contest 2007 , it had to compete in a semi-final for the first time since 2004 because of new rules put into effect by the European Broadcasting Union ( EBU ) . In previous years , countries that received a top 10 placing were automatically granted a spot in the next year 's final without having to compete in a semi-final , but for 2008 , the EBU changed the automatic qualification regulations so that all countries except the " Big 4 " ( France , Germany , Spain , and the United Kingdom ) and host country , would have to pass through one of two semi-finals . The EBU split up countries with a friendly voting history into separate semi-finals , to give a better chance for other countries to win . Greece and Cyprus had often been accused of favoring each other , with each awarding the other the maximum number of points ( twelve ) at the previous contest . On January 28 , 2008 , the EBU held a special draw which determined that Greece would be in '' Semi-final 1 '' held on May 20 , 2008 in Belgrade , Serbia ; Cyprus was subsequently placed in the second semi-final

		CONTEXT=As the title says , only rock and heavy metal videos are played in this program block . The program was widely criticized by the pentecostal movements of Finland in its early days for allegedly promoting Satanist attitudes , even though the program has never contained any Satanist music at all . The whole channel was even boycotted for a time by all kinds of Christian denominations due to " glorifying secularism and sacrilegious attitudes and spoiling the lives of young , innocent children and the youth of Finland " and the boycott was backed with the classic claims of backmasking having revealed hidden messages . At the time it was a widely believed stereotype that all metal and rock music was of the Satanist attitude , though these beliefs were mostly broken after the Eurovision Song Contest victory of Finnish heavy metal band Lordi in 2006 , which made metal music mainstream

QUERY_CONTEXT=Duane Allman created the idea of having two lead guitarists , which was inspired by Curtis Mayfield ; " he wanted the bass , keyboards , and second guitar to form patterns behind the solo rather than just comping , " said Allman . Their style and incorporation of guitar harmonies was very influential on later musicians . " The pair also had a wide range of complementary techniques , often forming intricate , interlocking patterns with each other and with the bassist , Berry Oakley , setting the stage for dramatic flights of improvised melodies . " Dickey Betts ' playing was very melody-based ; " My style is just a little too smooth and round to play the blues stuff straight , because I 'm such a melody guy that even when I 'm playing the blues , I go for melody first , " he said . His listening of country and string bluegrass growing up influenced this considerably : " I played mandolin , ukulele , and fiddle before I ever touched a guitar , which may be where a lot of the major keys I play come from . " He later characterized their style as " question and answer , anticipation and conclusion , " which involved allowing each musician 's downbeat to arrive in a different spot , while also keeping consideration of the bass guitar lines . The group also held an improvisational approach to live performances , which connected the band with jam band culture . " Jazz and blues musicians have been doing this for decades , but I think they really brought that sense that anyone onstage can inspire anyone else at any given time to rock music , " said Haynes . " We sure did n't set out to be a " jam band " but those long jams just emanated from within the band , because we did n't want to just play three minutes and be over , " said Allman . '' Rolling Stone '' referred to the group as " without question the first great jam band , and they took the jam to heights that it had not previously reached . " The Allman Brothers Band were considerably influential within the Southern United States . Their arrival on the musical scene paved the way for several other notable Southern rock bands — among those Lynyrd Skynyrd , the Marshall Tucker Band and Wet Willie — to achieve commercial success , and also " almost single-handedly " made Capricorn Records into " a major independent label . " Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top , writing for '' Rolling Stone '' , wrote that the group " defined the best of every music from the American South in that time . They were the best of all of us . " He went on to call the band " a true brotherhood of players — one that went beyond race and ego . It was a thing of beauty . " The band 's extended popularity through heavy touring in the early 1990s created a new generation of fans , one that viewed the Allmans as pioneers of " latter-day collegiate jam rock . " AllMusic praised the band 's history : " they went from being America 's single most influential band to a shell of their former self trading on past glories , to reach the 21st century resurrected as one of the most respected rock acts of their era . " In 2012 , an official historic marker was erected on the site of the July 1970 Second Atlanta International Pop Festival near Byron , Georgia . The Allman Brothers Band had played two sets at the festival , which was a significant event in their career . The marker text reads , in part : " Over thirty musical acts performed , including ... Macon 's Allman Brothers Band on their launching pad to national fame . " Official sponsors of the marker included the Georgia Allman Brothers Band Association , The Allman Brothers Band Museum at the Big House , and '' Hittin ' the Note '' . In 2003 , the band released a recording of their festival opening and closing performances , '' Live at the Atlanta International Pop Festival : July 3 & 5 , 1970 ''

		CONTEXT=In a positive review for '' Cuepoint '' , Robert Christgau argued that while Azalea may never demonstrate a powerful , soulful , or attractively melodic delivery , her " striving Australian-Atlantan cadence " is original and carries every song . He deemed ' ' The New Classic '' " plenty authentic -- and damn good to boot " while dismissing Azalea 's media naysayers : " predictably , the songs where she expresses wonderment that ' Impossible Is Nothing ' are more relatable than the ones where she flaunts her liquid assets . But the ones where she pledges to keep on striving are more relatable than that , because striving is built into her flow itself . That 's what her complexity is about . " Phil Johnson from '' The Independent '' called it " an instantly engaging showcase of the 23-year-old Aussie 's talents – poppy without diluting her fierce-flowing charisma . " Kellan Miller of '' XXL '' said despite some poor songs near the end of the record , it is " a persuasive indicator that Iggy Azalea will be around for the long haul . " '' The New Classic '' was named one of the best hip-hop albums of the year by '' XXL '' on a list published on 30 June 2014 , adding that " the album proved to a gang of skepts who doubted Iggy 's controversial style from the start that she was more than capable of making hip-hop tracks with a pop appeal . " It was placed at number twenty-five on Digital Spy 's top albums of 2014 and listed among Fuse 's 40 best albums of 2014 . The album won the Breakthrough Artist Release award at the 2014 ARIA Music Awards and Favorite Rap/Hip-Hop Album at the 2014 American Music Awards , beating out Drake 's '' Nothing Was the Same '' and Eminem 's '' The Marshall Mathers LP 2 '' . It received a nomination for Best Rap Album at the 57th Grammy Awards . The album was also up for Top Rap Album at the 2015 Billboard Music Awards

		CONTEXT=During the Armenian Genocide — along with hundreds of other Armenian intellectuals — Komitas was arrested and deported to a prison camp in April 1915 by the Ottoman government . He was soon released under unclear circumstances and experienced a mental breakdown and developed a severe case of posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) . The widespread hostile environment in Constantinople and reports of mass-scale Armenian death marches and massacres that reached him further worsened his fragile mental state . He was first placed in a Turkish military-operated hospital until 1919 and then transferred to psychiatric hospitals in Paris , where he spent the last years of his life in agony . Komitas is widely seen as a martyr of the genocide and has been depicted as one of the main symbols of the Armenian Genocide in art

QUERY_ANSWERS={'Caltavuturo massacre'}
QUERY_CONTEXT=According to many scholars , the name and origin of the town are traced back to the period of Arab rule . According to Ibn al-Athir ( '' The Complete History '' , VII .370.5 – 7 ) , in AH 268 ( 881/82 CE ) , the Aghlabid commander Abū Ṯawr was defeated by the Byzantines ( probably commanded by the '' strategos '' Mosilikes ) and his was army annihilated , with only seven men surviving . The locality was later named in Arabic '' Qalʿat Abī Ṯawr '' ( " Castle of Abū Ṯawr " ) , which is the origin of the modern name . Others instead maintain that the name derives from the Arabic word " qal ' at " ( fortress ) and the Sicilian " vuturu " ( vulture ) meaning of " fortress of vultures . " The town existed under Byzantine rule pre Arab conquest as Aziz Ahmad in “ A Islamic History of Sicily ” ( edinburgh university press 1975 ) states that in 852 Abbas raided Caltavuturo in the northern part of the Island and took many prisoners who were sold as slaves , The town was the site of the so-called Caltavuturo massacre on 20 January 1893 , when local authorities killed 13 and wounded 21 peasants that had occupied communal land that they claimed was theirs

In the course of these operations , mass reprisals were carried out , resulting in war crimes such as at Kommeno on August 16 , the Massacre of Kalavryta in December and the Massacre of Distomo in June 1944 .

The Germans therefore summarily executed over half of the divisions soldiers and all of its officers in revenge during the Massacre of the Acqui Division

		CONTEXT=During his assassination Tullius grabbed hold of Caesar 's toga and pulled it down from his neck , which signaled to the other conspirators that it was time to attack . According to historian Suetonius , Caesar shouted out in Latin , " Ista quidem vis est ! " ( " Why , this is violence ! " ) when his toga was ripped down from his shoulder . Another version often parroted is " What is this ? Such violence against Caesar ! " which seems to emphasise Caesar 's ego as it implies both affront and shock that anyone would ever dare to attempt to attack him . However , historian Ploutarchos , does not mention anything about Caesar having said this . He claims that Caesar cried out instead " Ῥωμαϊστί ‘ μιαρώτατε Κάσκα , τί ποιεῖς ; ’ " ( " Accursed Casca , what does thou ? " or " Casca , you villain , what are you doing ? " ) in Latin when he was grabbed by senator Casca . This exclamation , however , is not reported by Suetonius . Ploutarchos and Suetonius described that they believed that the last sound Caesar ever made was simply a groan as he was slashed by a knife the first time . Although the utterance was suggested to be more of an aggressive " spontaneous curse " than any kind of sigh

QUERY_CONTEXT=Blaine 's career as a Republican newspaperman led naturally to involvement in Republican party politics . In 1856 , he was selected as a delegate to the first Republican National Convention . From the party 's early days , Blaine identified with the conservative wing , supporting Supreme Court Justice John McLean for the presidential nomination over the more radical John C. Frémont , the eventual nominee . The following year , Blaine was offered the editorship of the '' Portland Daily Advertiser '' , which he accepted , selling his interest in the '' Journal '' soon thereafter . He still maintained his home in Augusta , however , with his growing family . Although Blaine 's first son , Stanwood , died in infancy , he and Harriet had two more sons soon afterward : Walker , in 1855 , and Emmons , in 1857 . They would have four more children in years to come : Alice , James , Margaret , and Harriet . It was around this time that Blaine left the Presbyterian church of his childhood and joined his wife 's new denomination , becoming a member of the South Parish Congregational Church in Augusta

QUERY_CONTEXT=The first official Republican convention in Illinois was held on May 29 , 1856 , in Bloomington . Chairman John M. Palmer was elected convention president after his opening address . Nine vice presidents and five secretaries were then elected . The convention nominated Bissell for governor with Francis Hoffmann as lieutenant governor , Ozias M. Hatch for secretary of state , Jesse K. Dubois as auditor , and James Miller as treasurer . Hoffmann was found to be ineligible for his position due to a residency requirement , and John Wood was nominated in his place . The following resolutions defining the party platform were approved : Resolved , That foregoing all former differences of opinions upon other questions , we pledge ourselves to unite in opposition to the present administration and to the party which upholds and supports it and to use all honorable and constitutional means to wrest the Government from the unworthy hands which now control it and to bring it back in its administration to the principles and practices of Washington , Jefferson and their great and good compatriots of the Revolution . Resolved , That foregoing all former differences of opinions upon other questions , we pledge ourselves to unite in opposition to the present administration of the Government ; that under the Constitution Congress possesses the power to prohibit slavery in the Territories ; and that , whilst we will maintain all constitutional rights of the South , we also hold that justice , humanity , the principles of freedom as expressed in our Declaration of Independence and our national constitution , and the purity and perpetuity of our Government require that that power shall be exerted to prevent the extension of slavery into territory heretofore free . Resolved , That the repeal of the Missouri Compromise was unwise and injurious ; an open and aggravated violation of the plighted faith of the States , and that the attempt of the present administration to force slavery into Kansas against the known wishes of the legal voters of that Territory is an arbitrary and tyrannous violation of the rights of the people to govern themselves , and that we will strive by all constitutional means to secure to Kansas and Nebraska the legal guaranty against slavery of which they were deprived at the cost of the violation of the plighted faith of the nation . Resolved , That we are devoted to the Union and will , to the last extremity , defend it against the efforts now being made by the dis-unionists of this administration to compass its dissolution , and that we will support the Constitution of the United States , in all its provisions regarding it , as the sacred bond of our Union and the only safeguard for the preservation of the rights of ourselves and our posterity . Resolved , That we are in favor of the immediate admission of Kansas as a member of this Confederacy under the constitution adopted by the people of said Territory . Resolved , That the spirit of our institutions as well as the Constitution of our country , guarantees the liberty of conscience as well as political freedom , and that we will proscribe no one by legislation or otherwise on account of religious opinions , or in consequence of place of birth . Lincoln delivered the closing address . The speech was purportedly so captivating that no reporter made a record of it . The address has become known as Lincoln 's Lost Speech . The delegates to the convention were : The Democrats had nominated Richardson for governor at their convention earlier that month . The remnants of the Whig party declined to run a candidate .

In one incident in the 2010 preseason he was removed from training and verbally reprimanded by club leadership when he was deemed unfit to train after a big night out . Despite these struggles , his on-field development was such that he would still debut in the 2010 season 's opening match , a 56-point Richmond loss against at the MCG . Martin recorded the sixth most disposals of any Tiger ( 18 ) to go along with four marks , three tackles and three clearances . Two weeks later Martin was convicted by the AFL tribunal for a high hit on Sydney 's Josh Kennedy in round 3 . He did not receive a suspension for the incident however , returning to football the following week . After four matches Martin ranked fourth in the league for clearances and eighth for hard-ball gets . Media reports emerged after round 8 that the 18 year old Martin had received a significant contract offer from expansion club the Greater Western Sydney Giants . The offer , which the Herald Sun ’s Mark Robinson claimed to be worth $ 2.4 million over three seasons , would have taken effect in the new club 's first AFL season in 2012 . Martin later said he had never entertained the idea of moving to the start-up club . In round 10 he had gained attention for his on-field efforts again , this time being nominated for the 2010 AFL Rising Star award after a 21 disposal and 11 clearance match against Port Adelaide . Due to his previous tribunal conviction however , Martin was ruled ineligible for the award and thus did not officially place in the end of season award 's points tally . He drew the attention of Sydney coach Paul Roos by round 14 , prompting Roos to send veteran Brett Kirk onto Martin in a tagging role . Despite this extra attention , he still managed to record 18 disposals and a goal in the match at the MCG . After 17 rounds Martin ranked second at the club for clearances and inside 50s as well as third for disposals and contested possessions . At the same time he ranked first among that season 's Rising Star nominees in clearances , contested possessions and inside 50s . He was also fourth for average disposals and fifth for average tackles . In round 19 he was rested by the club before returning to play out the final five matches of the season . He missed just that one game in his debut season and finished the year ranked second at Richmond for clearances and inside 50s , as well as third for both contested possessions and disposals . In addition to winning the Fred Swift Medal for fourth place at the club 's best and fairest night , Martin also received six votes in the Brownlow Medal count that year , the most by any Richmond debutant since Craig Lambert in 1988 . At season 's end he reiterated his commitment to the club ( and rejection of the former GWS overtures ) by signing a two-year contract extension that would keep him at Richmond until the end of the 2013 season . The extension was reported by the Herald Sun to be in the vicinity of $ 400,000-a-year

		CONTEXT=He arrived at the club as an incredibly shy and underdeveloped personality , a fact that was noted by teammate Trent Cotchin who said though Martin was 18 “ he seemed much younger in some of the ways he behaved . ” Indeed , he struggled initially to adjust to the expectations of professional football . In one incident in the 2010 preseason he was removed from training and verbally reprimanded by club leadership when he was deemed unfit to train after a big night out . Despite these struggles , his on-field development was such that he would still debut in the 2010 season 's opening match , a 56-point Richmond loss against at the MCG . Martin recorded the sixth most disposals of any Tiger ( 18 ) to go along with four marks , three tackles and three clearances . Two weeks later Martin was convicted by the AFL tribunal for a high hit on Sydney 's Josh Kennedy in round 3 . He did not receive a suspension for the incident however , returning to football the following week . After four matches Martin ranked fourth in the league for clearances and eighth for hard-ball gets . Media reports emerged after round 8 that the 18 year old Martin had received a significant contract offer from expansion club the Greater Western Sydney Giants . The offer , which the Herald Sun ’s Mark Robinson claimed to be worth $ 2.4 million over three seasons , would have taken effect in the new club 's first AFL season in 2012 . Martin later said he had never entertained the idea of moving to the start-up club . In round 10 he had gained attention for his on-field efforts again , this time being nominated for the 2010 AFL Rising Star award after a 21 disposal and 11 clearance match against Port Adelaide . Due to his previous tribunal conviction however , Martin was ruled ineligible for the award and thus did not officially place in the end of season award 's points tally . He drew the attention of Sydney coach Paul Roos by round 14 , prompting Roos to send veteran Brett Kirk onto Martin in a tagging role . Despite this extra attention , he still managed to record 18 disposals and a goal in the match at the MCG . After 17 rounds Martin ranked second at the club for clearances and inside 50s as well as third for disposals and contested possessions . At the same time he ranked first among that season 's Rising Star nominees in clearances , contested possessions and inside 50s . He was also fourth for average disposals and fifth for average tackles . In round 19 he was rested by the club before returning to play out the final five matches of the season . He missed just that one game in his debut season and finished the year ranked second at Richmond for clearances and inside 50s , as well as third for both contested possessions and disposals . In addition to winning the Fred Swift Medal for fourth place at the club 's best and fairest night , Martin also received six votes in the Brownlow Medal count that year , the most by any Richmond debutant since Craig Lambert in 1988 . At season 's end he reiterated his commitment to the club ( and rejection of the former GWS overtures ) by signing a two-year contract extension that would keep him at Richmond until the end of the 2013 season . The extension was reported by the Herald Sun to be in the vicinity of $ 400,000-a-year

		CONTEXT=These departures and injuries left Dayton with arguably the most limited roster , in both depth and physical size , in Division I . The Flyers played the bulk of their season with only six players who started the season on scholarships . In January 2015 , Bobby Wehrli , who had begun the season as a walk-on , was given a scholarship , but only for the spring of 2015 . No one left on the active roster , whether on scholarship or not , was taller than 6 ' 6 " ( 1.98 m ) . CBS Sports journalist Gary Parrish had this to say about the Flyers ' roster limitations ( emphasis in original ) : " To put this into perspective , consider that Kentucky has '' seven '' scholarship players taller than '' 6-8 '' , and that UK 's starting '' backcourt '' ( Andrew Harrison and Aaron Harrison ) is just as tall as Dayton 's starting '' frontcourt '' ( Dyshawn Pierre and Kendall Pollard ) . " Despite these limitations , the Flyers remained in contention for the A10 title for most of the season , ultimately finishing second in the regular-season standings , and advanced to the A10 Tournament final , losing there to VCU

		CONTEXT=" Motivation " is a R&B slow jam song written by Richard Butler ( Rico Love ) , Jim Jonsin , Dwayne Carter and Danny Morris . The racy lyrics center around Rowland asking her man to use his hands all over her body , and are accompanied by a " synth-saturated beat " produced by Jonsin . In terms of instruments , " Motivation " uses sparse keyboard notes , programmed beats and pulsing synths in the chorus . Wayne adds a rap verse complementing Rowland 's seductive suggestions , using the kitchen and a car as metaphors for sex . According to Scott Shetler from AOL Music , Rowland uses the lyrics to promise " to be her lover 's motivation . " Rowland called the record a mixture between dance and mash-up . When asked by MTV what Rowland thought of the song , she said , " It has that personality and characteristic to it that I do n't think anybody can deny . That 's why when Wayne dropped that insane verse on there ... I was like , ' You really brought that up even more . ' He went into the studio and just did it . I do n't think it takes much for Wayne to think . He just does it . He 's so admirable . " Ryan Brockington , from the '' New York Post , '' was amongst the first to review " Motivation . " In his review , he said " The single is a big leap from the dance club synth pop that Kelly has been releasing the past year and it seems like she might be trying to shimmy her way back into the hip-hop world by teaming up with the Midas touch vocals of Lil Wayne . " Both '' Rap-Up '' and AOL Music 's Scott Shetler called the song " sexy . " Becky Bain from Idolator disliked the song for not being memorable . The short review was summed up with the closing phrase , " she ’s going to need another hit to help promote her album when it finally is ready to drop . " Wesley Case from '' The Baltimore Sun '' complemented the song 's sexy quality . " If this is n't the year 's hands-down sexiest song thus far , it has to be in the discussion . Rowland , whose sultry voice could get a priest hot , weaving in and out of the minimal beat , and setting the table for Lil Wayne 's stuttering , after-hours guest-verse . Stack the pieces together and it 's an understated knockout that gets sexier with each spin . " Billboard ranked it number five on their " Critics ' Picks : 20 Best Songs of 2011 " " Motivation " was nominated for two awards at the 2011 Soul Train Music Awards including Best Dance Performance and Song of the Year.It won the award for Song of the Year and was also nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration at the 54th Grammy Awards , which was held on February 12 , 2012

		SCORE=1.2856959941132118e-07
		CONTEXT=Rasputin 's daughter Maria died in the 2006 crash of S7 Airlines Flight 778 , and his wife died six years later . He died in Moscow on 14 March 2015 , a day short of his 78th birthday . Patriarch Kirill of the Russian Orthodox Church conducted his funeral service , and President Vladimir Putin paid his respects . ( In 2014 Rasputin had co-signed a letter by writers in support of Putin 's annexation of the Crimea . ) Rasputin is closely associated with a movement in post-war Soviet literature known as " village prose , " or sometimes " rural prose " ( деревенская проза ) . Beginning in the time of the Khrushchev Thaw ( оттепель ) , village prose was praised for its stylistic and thematic departures from socialist realism . Village prose works usually focused on the hardships of the Soviet peasantry , espoused an idealized picture of traditional village life , and implicitly or explicitly criticized official modernization projects . Rasputin 's 1979 novel '' Farewell to Matyora '' , which depicts a fictional Siberian village which is to be evacuated and cleared so that a hydroelectric dam can be constructed further down the Angara River , was considered the epitome of this genre . The opening paragraph below is a good example of Rasputin 's writing style ( exceptional even for the village prose writers ) , and the novel 's theme of natural cycles disrupted by modernization : '' Once more spring had come , one more in the never-ending cycle , but for Matyora this spring would be the last , the last for both the island and the village that bore the same name . Once more , rumbling passionately , the ice broke , piling up mounds on the banks , and the liberated Angara River opened up , stretching out into a mighty , sparkling flow . Once more the water gushed boisterously at the island ’s upper tip , before cascading down both channels of the riverbed ; once more greenery flared on the ground and in the greens , the first rains soaked the earth , the swifts and swallows flew back , and at dusk in the bogs the awakened frogs croaked their love of life . It had all happened many times before . '' ( From Rasputin 's novel '' Farewell to Matyora '' , translated by Antonina W. Bouis , 1979 ) Rasputin 's nonfiction works contain similar themes , often in support of relevant political causes . He directed particularly trenchant criticism at large-scale dam building , like the project that flooded his own hometown , and water management projects , like the diversion of the Siberian rivers to Central Asia . He argued that these projects were destructive not simply in an ecological sense , but in a moral sense as well

		SCORE=2.669377295205777e-06
		CONTEXT=Safety has long been a concern in the mining business , especially in sub-surface mining . The Courrières mine disaster , Europe 's worst mining accident , involved the death of 1,099 miners in Northern France on March 10 , 1906 . This disaster was surpassed only by the Benxihu Colliery accident in China on April 26 , 1942 , which killed 1,549 miners . While mining today is substantially safer than it was in previous decades , mining accidents still occur . Government figures indicate that 5,000 Chinese miners die in accidents each year , while other reports have suggested a figure as high as 20,000 . Mining accidents continue worldwide , including accidents causing dozens of fatalities at a time such as the 2007 Ulyanovskaya Mine disaster in Russia , the 2009 Heilongjiang mine explosion in China , and the 2010 Upper Big Branch Mine disaster in the United States . Mining has been identified by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ( NIOSH ) as a priority industry sector in the National Occupational Research Agenda ( NORA ) to identify and provide intervention strategies regarding occupational health and safety issues . The Mining Safety and Health Administration ( MSHA ) was established in 1978 to " work to prevent death , illness , and injury from mining and promote safe and healthful workplaces for US miners . " Since its implementation in 1978 , the number of miner fatalities has decreased from 242 miners in 1978 to 28 miners in 2015

		CONTEXT=The Newton family home is located at 904 McDonald Avenue in Santa Rosa , which is still standing . The stone railway station in the film was built in 1904 for the Northwestern Pacific Railroad and is one of the few commercial buildings in central Santa Rosa to survive the earthquake of April 18 , 1906 . The station is currently a visitor center . The library was a Carnegie Library which was demolished in 1964 due to seismic concerns . Some of the buildings in the center of Santa Rosa that are seen in the film were damaged or destroyed by earthquakes in 1969 ; much of the area was cleared of debris and largely rebuilt . The film was scored by Dimitri Tiomkin , his first collaboration with Hitchcock ( the others being '' Strangers on a Train '' , '' I Confess '' and '' Dial M for Murder '' ) . In his score , Tiomkin quotes the '' Merry Widow Waltz '' of Franz Lehár , often in somewhat distorted forms , as a leitmotif for Uncle Charlie and his serial murders . During the opening credits , the waltz theme is heard along with a prolonged shot of couples dancing

QUERY_CONTEXT=And Japan was eager to take every opportunity . In 1869 they took advantage of the defeat of the rebels of the Republic of Ezo to incorporate definitely the island of Hokkaido to Japan . For centuries , Japan viewed the Ryukyu Islands as one of its provinces . In 1871 the Mudan incident happened : cannibal Taiwanese aborigines murdered 54 Ryūkyūan sailors that had their ship shipwrecked . At that time the Ryukyu Islands were claimed by both Qing China and Japan , and the Japanese interpreted the incident as an attack on their citizens . They took steps to bring the islands in their jurisdiction : in 1872 the Japanese Ryukyu Domain was declared , and in 1874 a retaliatory incursion to Taiwan was sent , which was a success . The success of this expedition emboldened the Japanese : not even the Americans could defeat the Taiwanese cannibals in the Formosa Expedition of 1867 . Very few gave it much thought at the time , but this was the first move in the Japanese expansionism series . Japan occupied Taiwan for the rest of 1874 and then left owing to Chinese pressures , but in 1879 it finally annexed the Ryukyu Islands . In 1875 Qing China sent a 300-men force to subdue the Taiwanese cannibals , but unlike the Japanese the Chinese were routed , ambushed and 250 of their men were killed ; the failure of this expedition exposed once more the failure of Qing China to exert effective control in Taiwan , and acted as another incentive for the Japanese to annex Taiwan .

		CONTEXT=The National Hardwood Lumber Association ! Founded ! Abbreviation ! Headquarters ! Industry ! Website The National Hardwood Lumber Association ( NHLA ) was founded on April 8th , 1898 in Chicago , Illinois to establish uniformity of inspecting hardwood lumber . The NHLA is now a membership-based trade association that serves two main purposes : to stimulate economic activity and to provide a vehicle for the members to collectively strive for mutual benefit . The NHLA has continued to be a national voice for the hardwood industry . Due to the Great Fire of 1871 , NHLA was unable to erect their own offices in 1898 , therefore they first established themselves in a dimly lit office of the Chicago Hardwood Lumber Exchange , where the first meeting of the 37 founders took place on April 8 , 1898 .

This array of attendance showed the critical situation which was threatening the industry through lack of uniform grading rules . William A. Bennett of Bennett & Witte Company was elected the first President of NHLA and immediately appointed a committee to draft the first rules for inspection . The first Rules Committee met with 59 firms and nine markets represented , and the committee established the first standardized set of hardwood lumber grading rules

They are sometimes referred to as the Bakiga or Kiga , while the singular form is Omukiga . Additionally , many Bakiga still lived in Rwanda at the time of European colonization . An Anglo - German agreement signed in Brussels on 14 May 1910 , modified part of the boundary between British and German territories initially established as the parallel of one degree south latitude by the treaty of 1890 . Modified were the sectors between the Congo tripoint and the junction of the Kakitumba and Kagera , comprising the present Rwanda - Uganda boundary , and between the junction and the second crossing of the parallel of one degree south latitude by the Kagera , comprising the western segment of the present Tanzania - Uganda boundary . Details of the final delimitation and demarcation of the Rwanda - Uganda boundary between the Congo tripoint of Sabinio and the southwestern branch ( Lubirizi ) of the Tshinzinga ( Muvogero ) are given in an Anglo - German Protocol signed at Kamwezi on 30 October 1911 . Therefore , many Bakiga became Ugandans by de facto in 1911 when the current international boundaries of Uganda were formally finalized .

		CONTEXT=Performances earned rave reviews from critics and publications , who praised D'Angelo 's energy and " charisma as a live performer " , as well as the Soultronics group , and received comparisons to outings by the legendary funk bands Parliament and Sly & the Family Stone . Tanya Bell of '' The Gazette '' wrote that the group " displayed enormous talent as it took them two hours to play 11 songs . " A staff writer for the '' Chicago Defender '' lauded his performance at the Chicago Theatre , calling it " an explosive mixture of R&B , soul and funk . " '' Rolling Stone '' called him " abundantly gifted , eye-poppingly spectacular " , " confident and worldly " in his performance at the House of Blues in Los Angeles . It compared the performance to his past concerts , stating " he 's alive onstage now , dancing , touching the audience , slamming his microphone down , lying on the ground at the lip of the stage to sing ' One Mo ' Gin ' while girls grab his legs , his stomach , his crotch . " In a review of D'Angelo 's tour-opening performance at the House of Blues , David Wollock of '' The Hollywood Reporter '' called it a " three-hour old-school soul marathon that was part ' Get Up ( I Feel Like Being a ) Sex Machine ' , part ' Let 's Get It On ' , part ' Move on Up ' gospel exuberance ... with call-and-response and other crowd-rousing church conventions " . He added that , " like the best hip-hop emcees who can rock a crowd with two turntables and a microphone , D moved the crowd with pure voice and charisma . " Kaia Shivers of the '' Los Angeles Sentinel '' commented that his Los Angeles tour stop placed the city " under a spell that it seems hard pressed to shake . " Reviewing his March performance at New York City 's Radio City Music Hall , rock critic Robert Christgau dubbed D'Angelo " R&B Jesus " and proclaimed himself a " believer " . Christgau praised D'Angelo 's delivery and compared the concert to a 1981 P-Funk outing at the Apollo Theater , stating " D'Angelo sang and danced and preached and flexed and crooned and humped the floor and covered Roberta Flack and snapped a mike stand in two and danced and sang and sang some more . Everything meshed ; all stops were pulled out . It was already the greatest concert I 'd seen in years when Redman and Method Man propelled the climactic ' Left and Right ' through the vaulted ceiling . I flashed on P-Funk 's ' Sadie ' , Apollo 1981 . What a privilege to experience such a thing again . " He also compared it to Marvin Gaye in concert , writing that " I saw Marvin Gaye at this venue shortly before he was murdered , and it was no contest . Gaye was fine , but self-indulgent and riddled with blank spots . "

Although there is not much there now , the island has reportedly been home to a golf course , a hotel , and even a small airport . The golf course was destroyed in 1936 when the island flooded . There is still the remnants of a foundation on the island . This was the foundation of the golf course club house . There are also four artesian wells on the island . Other than that , the island is mostly inhabited by snakes , bugs , and some birds . It is becoming increasingly overgrown these days . There is a stone bridge that connects it to land on the Bradford side . This can barely be seen when the water is low , and impossible when the water is high . The bridge was mostly destroyed in the 1936 flood that destroyed the golf course . The bridge was built to allow cows to move back and forth to the island for grazing . The island is not listed as an airport on any aeronautical charts . More than likely , that reference is to the area of the River on the north side of the island which was listed for landing seaplanes , and connected to an airfield which was previously located on Coffin Rd where there is now a marina .

		CONTEXT=On 4 October 2009 , Fred Halliday , Emeritus Professor of International Relations at the LSE and the School 's leading expert on the Middle East , wrote a memorandum to the LSE Council regarding the proposed cooperation with the Gaddafi Foundation . " I have repeatedly expressed reservations about formal educational and funding links with that country . " While those in favour of accepting the donation argued that " Libya is changing internally , " most informed observers agree that while some of the worst excesses for the moment have ceased , the rights of its people are badly protected . Libya " remains a country run by a secretive , erratic and corrupt elite . " Since 9/11 the Libyan government has reached compromises with the West on a number of issues , notably the Lockerbie bombing and nuclear weapons . Yet tactical changes in foreign policy are not sufficient for the purposes of evaluating political and academic links . There are also ways in which Libyan foreign policy has '' not '' changed : the country continues to call for the destruction of Israel ; Muammar Gaddafi recently called for the abolition of Switzerland , and he receives the leader of the Somali pirates operating off the Horn of Africa as honoured guests of state . Moreover , Libya 's handling of the Lockerbie bombing " has not been characterised by either consistency or clarity , " I have in the past , Halliday noted , defended accepting grants from authoritarian regimes such as the Gulf states , " but there should be clear limits on this , depending on the degree of political and human rights abuses perpetrated with them and on their ongoing foreign policy conduct . " Whitehall and the City are now happy to do business with Libya , but it does not follow that the LSE should do the same . Responsible leaders throughout the Middle East continue to express reservations regarding Libya , including " its more prominent ' liberal ' representatives . " We must remember , Halliday concluded , that the " liberal " wing within a regime such as Libya does not have the function of producing change but its role is instead " to reach compromises with internal hard-liners that serve to lessen external pressure . " A good case in point are the proposals LSE now is considering . It is , as LSE alumni in positions of responsibility in the region caution , " far too early for the School to take this step . " In 2009 , Human Rights Watch was allowed entry to Libya , via Saif al-Islam Gaddafi 's non-profit organization in order to gather facts about the human rights situation there . While HRW reported that there were concerns about the " repressive atmosphere , " they felt there were signs of " improvement " and Sarah Leah Whitson , director of HRW 's Middle East division said that one should not " underestimate the importance of the efforts made so far " by Gaddafi in the realm of human rights in Libya . She also wrote of her official visit that " the real impetus for the transformation rests squarely with a quasi-governmental organization , the Qaddafi Foundation for International Charities and Development " chaired by Gaddafi . She praised Gaddafi for establishing the country 's two semi-private newspapers , and said " it is impossible to underestimate the importance of the efforts made so far . Let 's hope this spring will last . " In January 2011 , HRW criticised other organisations as well as governments that had previously dealt with Gaddafi . HRW Business and Human Rights Director Arvind Ganesan condemned the London School of Economics ( LSE ) for allowing " abusive and corrupt officials or their families to launder their images in exchange for money " . This was later followed by Ganesen saying that " the London School of Economics did not act until Saif al-Islam 's father literally began to kill his own people " . According to NGO Monitor , this was despite the fact that David Held , Co-Director of LSE Global Governance , was partially influenced by Whitson 's remarks regarding her Libyan visit , referring to Saif al-Islam Gaddafi as a reformer

		CONTEXT=Jasser has said that he and his family have helped build a number of small mosques in different cities using locally raised funds , and at times encountering , but always overcoming local opposition . In 2010 Jasser strongly opposed the building of the Park51 project , a 13-story Islamic community center and mosque two blocks from the World Trade Center site , which is also known as Ground Zero . He said he was concerned that the funding of the $ 100 million project might be coming from foreign Islamist sources , and also said : " Ground Zero is purely about being American . It can never be about being Muslim . " Jasser believes acts of Islamic terrorism are rooted in the ideology of political Islam or Islamism . He has expressed the opinion that the 2009 Christmas Day attempted airplane bombing , the 2009 Fort Hood shooting , and the 2010 Times Square car bombing attempt have not prodded the United States into the appropriate action , but rather have resulted in politically correct denial by U.S. government authorities , and inaction by most American Muslims . He believes that even the Bush administration took inadequate measures against Islamism in America . He says the U.S. needs to provide alternatives for Muslim youth and promote reformist groups . In his television appearances , Jasser has claimed that 3 to 5 percent of U.S. Muslims are militant and 30 to 40 percent do not believe in separation of mosque and state . He also states that he believes many Western Muslim imams are too timid in their response to Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant seemingly both criticizing but also sympathizing with its goal of a caliphate stating " Clearly , the majority of the mosques in the United States are led by imams who are Islamists — who believe that in Muslim-majority countries that the state should be identified as an Islamic state . " Jasser is an outspoken supporter of Israel and believes that Muslim organizations and leaders need to be held to a litmus test to see whether they recognize Israel as a state . Jasser and a group of American Muslims founded the nonprofit American Islamic Forum for Democracy ( AIFD ) in 2003 with the goal of demonstrating the compatibility of Islam with democracy and American values . Jasser is the group 's president and chief spokesman . The AIFD supports separation of religion and state , religious pluralism , equality of the sexes , the unconditional recognition of Israel , and the creation of an independent Palestine " on the current ' occupied territories . ' " The organization rejects terrorism and any justification for it

		CONTEXT=By May 2009 , '' The Tree of Life '' had been sold to a number of international distributors , including Europacorp in France , TriPictures in Spain , and Icon in the UK and Australia , but lacked a US distributor . In August 2009 , it was announced that the film would be released in the US through Apparition , a new distributor founded by River Road Entertainment head Bill Pohlad and former Picturehouse chief Bob Berney . A tentative date of December 25 , 2009 was announced , but the film was not completed in time . Organisers of the Cannes Film Festival made negotiations to secure a premiere at Cannes 2010 , resulting in Malick sending an early version of the film to Thierry Fremaux and the Cannes selection committee . Though Fremaux warmly received the cut and was eager to screen the film at his festival , Malick ultimately told him that he felt the film was not ready . On the eve of the 2010 Cannes Film Festival , Berney suddenly announced his departure from Apparition , leaving the company 's future uncertain . Pohlad decided to keep '' The Tree of Life '' at Apparition , and after significant restructuring , hired Tom Ortenberg to act as a consultant on its release . A tentative plan was made to release it in late 2010 , in time for awards consideration . Ultimately , Pohlad decided to close Apparition and sell rights to the film . Private screenings of the film to interested parties Fox Searchlight Pictures and Sony Pictures Classics took place at the 2010 Telluride Film Festival . On September 9 , Fox Searchlight announced their acquisition of the film from Pohlad 's River Road Entertainment . The film opened in limited release in the United States on May 27 , 2011

Johnathan Holland of '' Variety '' wrote that the film is a " quietly devastating exploration " of its subject and that " the script is beautifully observant of the stresses immigration places on family and self . " However , Neil Young of '' The Hollywood Reporter '' wrote that the film " surprisingly says little about the hot-button subjects it ambitiously sets out to explore . " . Ryan Lattanzio of '' Indiewire '' wrote that " In the vein of Ozu or even Apichatpong Weerasethakul , the film is composed of sublime fragments of life passing by " and concluded with the statement , " Peaceful , almost biblical and completely absorbing , this film is a masterpiece . " French critics were overwhelmingly positive on the film . Jacques Mandelbaum of '' Le Monde '' wrote that the film is " a remarkable first feature " by the director , and that " the deep love that binds this man and wife , the tricks the father uses to regain the look of his daughters , adolescents who are discreet and facetious in sweetly paying him the suffering of his remoteness , is all rendered with a delicacy and almost miraculous simplicity . " . Comparing the film to other Mexican cinema , Bruno Icher of '' Liberation '' writes that the film is " a new proposal , delicate and charming in a register intimate and almost quasi-documentary . " Telerama pointed out the film 's " humanistic approach , modest and sensitive to the North-South disequilibrium . " Film journal '' Positif '' noted that the film 's " attention to mise en scene makes the most quotidian situations touching

		CONTEXT=In 1999 , Hudson directed '' My Life So Far '' . Jean-Claude Carrière wrote of it , " Hugh Hudson 's film '' My Life So Far '' is a delightful bittersweet film , which covers the start of a boy 's life during the first part of the 20th century – from his last baby 's bottle to his first cigar .
