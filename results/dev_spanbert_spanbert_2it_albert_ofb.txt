		CONTEXT=A 1628 view of the town already shows a simple bridge across the river . Farmers built a wooden bridge along the ford in 1502 which was garded from nearby '' Hohes Haus '' . It was destroyed by floods in 1534 , 1573 , 1595 , 1618 , 1656 , and 1661 , and had then been replaced by a ferry for more than 200 years . When a boat capsized in 1855 , three of its eleven passengers drowned . In 1889 a farmer from Zaßnitz on the opposite bank of the river had built a bridge suspended from a rope and charged a fee for its usage . The miller Schlobach took it over later and leased it out . In 1936 the bridge came under municipal management . The toll booth remained standing for a long time . At Christmas 1940 the users welcomed a reduction of the toll , and at Easter 1942 the usage of the bridge became free . Soldiers of United States Army blocked and guarded the bridge from 14 April 1945 , it was reopened after the Red Army took over . The flood of July 1954 destroyed the bridge , and a ferry operated again for some months . While inhabitants of Rochlitz and Zaßnitz built a temporary bridge on their own , the Rochlitz council held back material saved from the old bridge . A new , higher suspension bridge was built in 1958 about 30 m from the old location . It was extensively rehabilitated after the 2002 European floods and was closed temporarily after the 2013 European floods

		GOLD_MENTION=earthquake
		CONTEXT=Around the early 16th century , following the construction of the Ribeira Palace beside the Tagus river , the Palace of Alcáçova began to lose its importance . An earthquake occurring in 1531 further damaged the old castle , contributing further to its decay and neglect . In 1569 , King Sebastian ordered the rebuilding of the royal apartments in the castle , intending to use it as his official residence . As part of the rebuilding , in 1577 Filippo Terzi demolished one of the towers near the principal facade of the Church of Loreto . However , many of the works were never completed after the young king 's apparent death during the Battle of Alcácer Quibir . The following Portuguese dynastic crisis opened the way for sixty years of Spanish rule and the castle was converted into military barracks and a prison . On 30 December 1642 , Teodósio de Frias the Younger was appointed master builder to continue the works begun by his father , Luís de Frias , and his grandfather , Teodósio de Frias . This was part of a greater plan by the Spanish forces to recommission the fortification . However , after Portugal regained its independence following the Portuguese Restoration War , the works were taken over by the Portuguese government . On 6 November 1648 , Nicolau de Langres was called upon to take over the design , execution and construction of a new fortification that would surround the Castle of São Jorge and the city walls of Lisbon . In 1650 the military architect Mateus do Couto was named master builder of the project and reconstruction took on a new formality : although the military engineer João Gillot built new walls in 1652 , construction again followed Couto 's plans between 1657 and 1733 . In 1673 , the Soldiers ' Hospital , dedicated to '' São João de Deus '' ( St John of God ) , was installed on the grounds beside the Rua do Recolhimento . At the end of the 17th century the '' Recolhimento do Castelo '' ( " Castle Shelter " ) was constructed along the southeast angle of the courtyard , and in 1733 , new projects were initiated by master Custódio Vieira

		GOLD_MENTION=Republican National Convention
		CONTEXT=The organization 's leaders maintained that " some U.S. laws , such as the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 , which limits the amount of time a family can receive federal assistance , violate Articles 23 , 25 and 26 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights . Those articles guarantee , respectively , the right to work for a living wage under humane conditions ; the right to adequate food , housing , medical care and social security ; and the right to education . " Starting in June 1998 , KWRU led the New Freedom Bus Tour , which traveled across the country , gathering stories of human rights violations to present as a petition to the United Nations . " Under the banner ' Freedom from Unemployment , Hunger and Homelessness , ' the KWRU team collected additional evidence on the negative impact of welfare reform and held educational sessions teaching the poor about their economic rights . " ( A second such bus tour was organized by the PPEHRC in November – December 2002 , which traveled to 27 cities to record human rights violations . ) In the late 1990s , Honkala started another nonprofit , the Poor People 's Economic Human Rights Campaign , of which she became National Coordinator . The PPEHRC represents " a network of over 40 poor people 's organizations from across the U.S. " One commentator has written that the campaign " is the only national movement to come out of welfare reform that has been organized by poor people , and not their advocates . " This organization was formed in direct response to the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act ( PRWORA ) of 1996 ( also known as the Welfare Reform Act ) , signed into law by Democratic President Bill Clinton , which she and her allies claim hurts recipients of welfare . The organization 's mission statement reads , " The Poor People 's Economic Human Rights Campaign is committed to uniting the poor across color lines as the leadership base for a broad movement to abolish poverty . We work to accomplish this through advancing economic human rights as named in the universal declaration of human rights — such as the rights to food , housing , health , education , communication and a living wage job . " Part of the purpose of the organization is to make homelessness and the homeless visible , in order to force politicians to act . Honkala claims that the latter prefer that the homeless remain invisible , so they wo n't have to address the problem . In a speech , Honkala said : " That 's what the authorities are saying to you : ' Go hide ! Go be under a bridge , or ... hide under a bench , and we wo n't arrest you , we wo n't do anything to you , because you will be quiet ! ' " As Honkala declared , " When you have nothing , you still have your voice . " In October 1999 , PPEHRC organized a month-long March of the Americas , from Washington , DC , to the United Nations in New York . Participants in the march included low-income families from the US , Canada and Latin America . The group " marched 15 miles a day for 32 days , sleeping in tent cities , churches and community centers at night , and holding press conferences and protests in local communities . " In July 2000 , a PPEHRC march for the opening day of the Republican Party 's National Convention in Philadelphia drew 10,000 homeless and poor people from around the country . ( Of the several protest marches during that convention , this was the only one denied a permit by city authorities . ) In November 2000 , at the historic Riverside Church in Manhattan in New York City , the PPEHRC held a " Poor People 's World Summit to End Poverty , " consisting of several hundred activists from some 30 countries , to share " experiences and work to build an international movement for economic human rights drawing explicitly on international treaties . " On July 4 , 2003 , Philadelphia held a celebration for the opening of the National Constitution Center , a new facility housing the Liberty Bell . Poor and homeless families from the city held a peaceful protest to demand their economic rights . " As the demonstrators marched toward Constitution Center single-file , carrying their own mattresses and led by children , park rangers , federal guards , and city police formed lines to prevent the families from approaching . Singing ' We Shall Not Be Moved , ' the demonstrators locked arms and refused to leave the sidewalk . Protest leaders Honkala and Galen Tyler had prepared a ' Declaration of Economic Human Rights ' to present at the Center . As they moved toward the Center , police moved to stop them , threw them to the ground , handcuffed them , and placed them under arrest ... Honkala was charged with one first-degree felony and four other felony counts . Police officers claimed that Honkala had struck one of them in the chest . However , a video taken at the time clearly shows Honkala carrying a mattress and being struck by the officer ... all the charges were subsequently withdrawn by the District Attorney 's office . " In August 2004 , Honkala marched with the PPEHRC in New York City ( without a permit ) to protest President Bush and the Republican National Convention ( RNC ) and to publicly call for greater attention by the government to the needs of the poor and homeless

		CONTEXT=Bill Rasmussen conceived the concept of ESPN in late May 1978 , after he was fired from his job with the World Hockey Association 's New England Whalers . One of the first steps in Bill and his son Scott 's ( who had also been let go by the Whalers ) process was finding land to build the channel 's broadcasting facilities . The Rasmussens first rented office space in Plainville , Connecticut . However , the plan to base ESPN there was put on hold because of a local ordinance prohibiting buildings from bearing rooftop satellite dishes . Available land area was quickly found in Bristol , Connecticut ( where the channel remains headquartered to this day ) , with funding to buy the property provided by Getty Oil , which purchased 85 % of the company from Bill Rasmussen on February 22 , 1979 , in an attempt to diversify the company 's holdings . This helped the credibility of the fledgling company , however there were still many doubters to the viability of their sports channel concept . Another event that helped build ESPN 's credibility was securing an advertising agreement with Anheuser - Busch in the spring of 1979 ; the company invested $ 1 million to be the " exclusive beer advertised on the network .

He was clad entirely in black with a long trench coat and arrogantly refused to speak English . He spoke through an interpreter — Uta Ludendorff — and was accompanied to the ring by a large wrestler known as The Wall . The promos coincided with the aftermath of the Columbine school massacre , which threw a hitch in WCW 's plans .

		CONTEXT=Since the early 2000s , Belgrade plutocracy began building summer houses on the bank , in the protected zone despite the ban . Originally those were smaller , wooden houses but in time , as there was no official reaction , the construction of the proper multi-floor houses and villas with private peers on the river began . Owners of the villas include politicians , judges , managers of the state owned companies and known criminals . Use of heavy building machinery and trucks deteriorated the embankment itself , while the forests in the riparian zone were cut in order to fill the building ground with additional earth and gravel . That way , the riparian zone was elevated , stultifying its existence , as the area ready to accept the excess waters during floods was reduced . Another problem caused by the houses is possible contamination of 16 Ranney collectors in this area , which are part of Belgrade 's water supply system . The houses also physically obstruct access to the wells for the communal services . None of the floods that hit Serbia since then , including the massive 2009 European floods and 2014 Southeast Europe floods , prompted authorities to stop the destruction of the zone . Dragan Đilas , mayor of Belgrade 2008-13 , publicly stated that city has no money to tangle the problem , thus allowing the continued construction

		CONTEXT=In an op-ed for '' The Intercept '' , James Risen chided the media for its lopsided reporting on emails : To their disgrace , editors and reporters at American news organizations greatly enhanced the Russian echo chamber , eagerly writing stories about Clinton and the Democratic Party based on the emails , while showing almost no interest during the presidential campaign in exactly how those emails came to be disclosed and distributed ... The hack was a much more important story than the content of the emails themselves , but that story was largely ignored because it was so easy for journalists to write about Clinton campaign chair John Podesta . On July 27 , 2016 , the '' New York Times '' reported that Julian Assange , in an interview on British ITV on June 12 , 2016 , had " made it clear that he hoped to harm Hillary Clinton 's chances of winning the presidency " , and that in a later interview on the program Democracy Now ! on July 25 2016 , the first day of the Democratic National Convention , he acknowledged that " he had timed their release to coincide with the Democratic convention . " In an interview with CNN , Assange would neither confirm nor deny who WikiLeaks ' sources were ; he claimed that his website " ... might release " a lot more material " relevant to the US electoral campaign ... " Following the publication of the stolen emails , NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden criticized WikiLeaks for its wholesale leakage of data , writing that " their hostility to even modest curation is a mistake . " The '' Washington Post '' contrasted the difference between WikiLeaks ' practices and Snowden 's disclosure of information about NSA : while Snowden worked with journalists to vet documents ( withholding some where it would endanger national security ) , WikiLeaks ' " more radical " approach involves the dumping of " massive , searchable caches online with few — if any — apparent efforts to remove sensitive personal information . " On July 25 , 2016 , Anne Applebaum , columnist for the '' Washington Post '' , writes that ... with the exception of a few people on Twitter and a handful of print journalists , most of those covering this story , especially on television , are not interested in the nature of the hackers , and they are not asking why the Russians apparently chose to pass the emails on to WikiLeaks at this particular moment , on the eve of the Democratic National Convention . They are focusing instead on the content of what were meant to be private emails ... She goes on to describe in detail other Russian destabilization campaigns in Eastern European countries

" Sava noted that while the episode was humorous , much of the comedy was undercut by the tragic and distressing nature of Finn 's story . Andrew Tran of Overmental argued that " the episode ... dissects vividly that bottomless feeling of midlife wanderlust ... not the road-trippy , running-through-the-fields kind but rather the life-map-disappearing-in-your-hands , what-the-hell-is-next kind . " Tran contended that , through the use of video game tropes , explores the idea that life is ultimately unpredictable that there " is no map that you can make for yourself ( or that anyone can give you ) that can account for everything you ’re going to encounter " . " The Hall of Egress " has been highly lauded by the show 's production staff , with series creator Pendleton Ward in particular naming it as one of his favorites .

		CONTEXT=The International Socialist Organization ( ISO ) was a Trotskyist group active primarily on college campuses in the United States that was founded in 1976 and dissolved in 2019 . The organization held Leninist positions on imperialism and the role of a vanguard party . However , it did not believe that necessary conditions for a revolutionary party in the United States were met ; ISO believed that it was preparing the ground for such a party . The organization held a Trotskyist critique of nominally socialist states , which it considered class societies . In contrast , the organization advocated the tradition of " socialism from below . " as articulated by Hal Draper . Initially founded as a section of the International Socialist Tendency ( IST ) , it was strongly influenced by the perspectives of Draper and Tony Cliff . It broke from the IST in 2001 , but continued to exist as an independent organization for the next eighteen years . The organization advocated independence from the U.S. two - party system and sometimes supported electoral strategies by outside parties , especially the Green Party of the United States .

		GOLD_MENTION=Preparedness Day Bombing
		CONTEXT=In September 1917 , he was appointed counsel to a commission , the President 's Mediation Committee , established by President Wilson to resolve major strikes threatening war production . Among the disturbances he investigated were the 1916 Preparedness Day Bombing in San Francisco , where he argued strongly that the radical leader Thomas Mooney had been framed and required a new trial . He also examined the copper industry in Arizona , where industry bosses solved industrial relations problems by having more than 1,000 strikers forcibly deported to New Mexico . Overall , Frankfurter 's work gave him an opportunity to learn firsthand about labor politics and extremism , including anarchism , communism and revolutionary socialism . He came to sympathize with labor issues , arguing that " unsatisfactory , remediable social conditions , if unattended , give rise to radical movements far transcending the original impulse . " His activities led the public to view him as a radical lawyer and supporter of radical principles . Former President Theodore Roosevelt accused him of being " engaged in excusing men precisely like the Bolsheviki in Russia . " Frankfurter and Supreme Court justice Louis Brandeis secretly collaborated over many years on numerous covert political activities . The relationship began after Brandeis secured Frankfurter a position at Harvard through Jacob Schiff . Brandeis enlisted Frankfurter as his paid political lobbyist and lieutenant . In May 1917 when U.S. Secretary of State Robert Lansing received a report that the Ottomans were extremely weary of the war and that it might be possible to induce them to break with Germany and make a separate peace with Britain , Brandeis and Frankfurter worked to prevent this from occurring . Frankfurter became part of the delegation and persuaded the delegation ’s leader , former Ambassador Henry J. Morgenthau , to abandon the effort . This was described in books by Jehuda Reinharz , Peter Grose , Peter Balakian , and Charles Glass , as reported in '' Against Our Better Judgement '' , by Alison Weir

		ANSWER=chair John Podesta .
		GOLD_MENTION=Democratic convention
		CONTEXT=In an op-ed for '' The Intercept '' , James Risen chided the media for its lopsided reporting on emails : To their disgrace , editors and reporters at American news organizations greatly enhanced the Russian echo chamber , eagerly writing stories about Clinton and the Democratic Party based on the emails , while showing almost no interest during the presidential campaign in exactly how those emails came to be disclosed and distributed ... The hack was a much more important story than the content of the emails themselves , but that story was largely ignored because it was so easy for journalists to write about Clinton campaign chair John Podesta . On July 27 , 2016 , the '' New York Times '' reported that Julian Assange , in an interview on British ITV on June 12 , 2016 , had " made it clear that he hoped to harm Hillary Clinton 's chances of winning the presidency " , and that in a later interview on the program Democracy Now ! on July 25 2016 , the first day of the Democratic National Convention , he acknowledged that " he had timed their release to coincide with the Democratic convention . " In an interview with CNN , Assange would neither confirm nor deny who WikiLeaks ' sources were ; he claimed that his website " ... might release " a lot more material " relevant to the US electoral campaign ... " Following the publication of the stolen emails , NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden criticized WikiLeaks for its wholesale leakage of data , writing that " their hostility to even modest curation is a mistake . " The '' Washington Post '' contrasted the difference between WikiLeaks ' practices and Snowden 's disclosure of information about NSA : while Snowden worked with journalists to vet documents ( withholding some where it would endanger national security ) , WikiLeaks ' " more radical " approach involves the dumping of " massive , searchable caches online with few — if any — apparent efforts to remove sensitive personal information . " On July 25 , 2016 , Anne Applebaum , columnist for the '' Washington Post '' , writes that ... with the exception of a few people on Twitter and a handful of print journalists , most of those covering this story , especially on television , are not interested in the nature of the hackers , and they are not asking why the Russians apparently chose to pass the emails on to WikiLeaks at this particular moment , on the eve of the Democratic National Convention . They are focusing instead on the content of what were meant to be private emails ... She goes on to describe in detail other Russian destabilization campaigns in Eastern European countries

" Sava noted that while the episode was humorous , much of the comedy was undercut by the tragic and distressing nature of Finn 's story .

		CONTEXT=<section begin="lead" /> In 2015 , an anti-abortion organization named the Center for Medical Progress ( CMP ) released several videos that had been secretly recorded . Members of the CMP posed as representatives of a biotechnology company in order to gain access to both meetings with abortion providers and abortion facilities . The videos showed how abortion providers made fetal tissue available to researchers , although no problems were found with the legality of the process . All of the videos were found to be altered , according to analysis by Fusion GPS and its co-founder Glenn R. Simpson , a former investigative reporter for The Wall Street Journal . The CMP disputed this finding , attributing the alterations to the editing out of " bathroom breaks and waiting periods . " CMP had represented a longer version of the tapes as being " complete " , as well as a shorter , edited version . The analysis by Fusion GPS concluded that the longer version was also edited , with skips and missing footage . Nonetheless , the videos attracted widespread media coverage ; after the release of the first video , conservative lawmakers in Congress singled out Planned Parenthood and began to push bills that would strip the organization of federal family planning funding . No such attempts by Congress to cut federal family planning money from Planned Parenthood have become law . Conservative politicians in several states have also used this as an opportunity to cut or attempt to cut family planning funding at the state level .

		ANSWER=Politics Institute .
		GOLD_MENTION=political purges
		CONTEXT=Unlike their father , all three of the Lasks ' sons had joined the German Communist Party by 1933 . Of the three of them , the youngest , Ernst , stayed for a time in Berlin working " underground " for the Communist Party ( which was now illegal ) . He was assigned to the party 's " anti-militarist " department which was in effect a cover name for the German Communist Party 's news service . He then fled , following his mother to Moscow , where he worked first for the Agriculture Institute and then for the International Economics and Politics Institute . However , at the end of June 1936 , a month after his thirtieth birthday , Ernst died of tuberculosis in the First University Clinic in Moscow hospital . The other two , Hermann and Ludwig , were arrested in 1938 , when the political purges in Moscow were still at their height . The middle son , Hermann , was banned to Arkhangelsk in the north where he lived with his widowed mother between 1941 and 1944 . He was eventually transferred to the Soviet " Labor army " , and returned to what remained in Germany in 1948 . The eldest son is sometimes identified in sources as Ludwig and sometimes as Lutz . Lutz , who had a degree in human economics ( '' " Volkswirtschaft " '' ) , was working at the Marx-Engels-Lenin Institute in Moscow when he was arrested . His detention included eight years in a camp at Kolyma in the Far East . Like his brother Hermann , he survived his time in the Soviet Union , but he was only permitted to return to Germany in 1953 . After Lutz was arrested , his wife , Dora , keen to avoid getting caught up in Stalin 's latest purge , left Moscow with their daughter Franziska . They crossed Europe and arrived in England towards the end of the summer of 1939 . Having avoided imprisonment by the Soviets , in London Dora was identified as an enemy alien and imprisoned in Holloway jail , and then " interned " on the Isle of Man . By the end of the war she had been released , and lived in England for the rest of her life : she died from kidney disease in 1952 , the year before the Soviets were finally persuaded to release her husband

However , according to Smith , Tomocomo did not realize who they had met until it was explained to him afterward . Tomocomo was disappointed that the King did not offer a present , saying to Smith " You gave Powhatan a white dog , which Powhatan fed as himself , but your King gave me nothing , and I am better than your white dog . " When Tomocomo returned to Virginia with Samuel Argall and Rolfe in March 1617 , he reportedly uttered diatribes ( poor remarks ) " against England , English people " and against Thomas Dale , governor of Jamestown . The colonists rebutted his claims in front of the Powhatan leaders , and Tomocomo apparently was disgraced . However , Chief Powhatan died the next year , and his successor , Opechancanough , began planning a massive attack on the settlers . Nothing more is known of Tomocomo 's life . Paul O'Connor voiced him in the Animated Hero Classics 1994 episode '' Pocahontas '' . O ' Connor also voiced Japazaws who lured the princess with a copper kettle to her abduction by Argall .

Later , in September 2014 , Spears posted a picture of herself in the studio , hinting that she was recording new music . In another interview , a month later , she revealed that she was working " very slowly , but progressively " on the album . In 2015 , she released the song " Pretty Girls " with Iggy Azalea , however the song was met with moderate impact and Spears headed back to the studio to record more songs , but did n't have plans to release a new album .

" A month later , Tranter gave an interview for website NewNowNext about his work with Spears and commented : " Working with Britney is a fucking dream . She is so sweet , so inspiring and a master on the mic . Me and Julia had to leave the studio one day because our screams of excitement after every take she did were distracting the producers . " In late 2016 , during interviews to promote the album , Spears declared that she wanted to explore new things on the record , and that it was her " most hip-hop album , " explaining : " ... there are like two or three songs that go in the direction of more urban that I 've wanted to do for a long time now , and I just have n't really done that . " In May 2016 , in an exclusive interview for website '' Breathe Heavy '' , Tranter revealed : " Nobody ever talks about Britney as a writer and she ’s f " Do You Wan na Come Over ?

Mattman & Robin were also responsible for programming , drums , percussion , snaps , handclaps , synths , guitars , bass and kalimba , while Michaels and Jermaine Jackson provided background vocals . It was recorded at 158 Studios , Westlake Village , California , The Studio at the Palms , Las Vegas , Nevada , and at Wolf Cousins Studios , Stockholm , Sweden . " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is an electropop , and dance-pop song that lasts for three minutes and twenty-two seconds ( 3:22 ) . It features " subtle keyboards , a strummed guitar , " and " wobbly bass " in its instrumentation . For Brian Josephs of '' Spin '' , the song 's guitar slaps " recall her 2001 single ' I 'm a Slave 4 U. ' " Other critics also felt that the " strummed flamenco guitar " on the song is similar to those on Justin Timberlake 's " Like I Love You " . Bianca Gracie of '' Fuse '' opined that the song reminded her of " the glory days ( no pun intended ) of ' Circus ' and ' Femme Fatale ' . " Lyrically , " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is a flirty song about Spears " offer ing several reasons why her lover should come over and options , which can be seen in the lines " Nobody should be alone if they do n't have to be " and " I could get into that kissin ' and touchin ' / Or we could be good and do next to nothin ' . " Amy Roberts of '' Bustle '' noted that the lyrics are about hooking up , adding that they " celebrate the idea that casual relationships do n't need to be lacking respect or understanding . You do n't have to be in love with , or committing to , the person that you 're hooking up with , but that also does n't mean that you ca n't connect with them on a different level than just sex . In fact , Spears makes it clear that it 's kind of even cool if her hook-up does n't want to have sex . Her partner can draw the boundaries of where the massage she 's offering starts and ends , and if it remains as nothing more than a back rub then so be it – that 's totally cool . " For Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine , the song features " some dubious lyrics that seem to suggest masturbatory self-love " in the lines : " All I want is what you want/And all you want is me . " The chorus of the song features " a shouted gang " of backup singers , singing : " Whatever you want / whatever you need / I 'll do it ! . " Lewis Corner of Digital Spy called it " a thumping pop anthem , " praising " Britney 's seductive vocal delivery . " Gil Kaufman of '' Billboard '' named it a " fun , flirty " track . Bianca Gracie of '' Fuse '' described it as a " pulsating track that is a flirty booty call that is bound to own the dance floor . " Robbie Daw of Idolator found it to be " a traditional Spears-style chunk of dance-pop " and " arguably the best yet , with its thick whomping bass and that sparkling ' nobody should be alone if they do n't have to be ' breakdown . " Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine called it " impeccably produced downstairs music , " adding that it " is an irresistible slice of dance-pop , with an ebullient bassline and staccato acoustic guitar . " Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic declared that " some of the highlights on the album are the silliest songs , " citing " Do You Wan na Come Over " 's " overheated flamenco chorus " as an example . Maura Johnston of '' Boston Globe '' said the song was one of the album 's high points , noting that the song " is jolted to life by the slashed guitars that helped make ' Toxic ' a pop thrill . " John Murphy of musicOMH was positive while noting that the track " has a rush and urgency about it which marks it out as one of the album 's best songs . " Nolan Feeney of '' Entertainment Weekly '' also picked it as a highlight , praising the " acoustic guitars and gurgling bass lines that make for one freaky pop experiment . " Alex Macpherson of '' The Guardian '' wrote that the song " takes the party back to Britney 's heyday , " praising the inclusion of the flamenco guitar . For '' Los Angeles Times '' writer Mikael Wood , the song " restore s some of the sonic invention that once defined Spears ' biggest hits . " Nick Levine , writing for '' NME '' , echoed the same thought , writing : " The lusty strut of ‘ Do You Wan na Come Over ? ’ nods to her early-noughties Neptunes-produced hits . " In his Vice column , Robert Christgau selected " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " and " Clumsy " as his favorite tracks on the album . Amy Mackelden of '' Bustle '' elaborated about the track : With a strong '90s vibe , an upbeat tempo , and a surprising rhythm , " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " utilizes the best of Spears ' talents . ... " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " embraces the current trend for songs that are musically complicated , that layer up their beats and sound effects , and feature multiple voices and infectious shouting during their choruses . Much like Hailee Steinfeld and Gwen Stefani 's latest offerings , " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is melodic , has a fast tempo , and is instantly recognizable . And most importantly , it 's fun . On August 18 , 2016 , Spears added " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " , as well as " Make Me ... " , to the setlist of her Las Vegas residency show Britney : Piece of Me . Later , on September 1 , 2016 , a performance of the song was broadcast from Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas for Today . During the performance , she used " an outfit similar to her risqué costume from 2016 's VMAs , while her backup dancers stood out in brightly-colored tank tops and shorts , " as reported by '' Entertainment Weekly '' Ruth Kinane . The song was also included in Spears 's setlist for the iHeartRadio Music Festival on September 24 , 2016 . Spears also performed it at I Heart Radio Jingle Ball , Triple Show and B26 Pepsi Jingle Bash during December 2016 . Also performed it at Apple Music Festival which was held in United Kingdom

		CONTEXT=The inexorable downward movement and melting of glaciers can result in objects lost within them reappearing many years later . The first recorded account of a body reappearing from a glacier in the Mont Blanc range was made by Viscount Edmond de Catelin in 1861 . It concerned three alpine guides who were buried in a crevasse during an avalanche on 20 August 1820 near the Rocher Rouges , high up on Mont Blanc , during an expedition organised by . Forty years later the remains of two of them were discovered , re-exposed within fissures in the Bossons glacier . They were lower down from the point where they were lost ; the corpse of the third guide was discovered the following year . In 2014 , a group of climbers found a body on the Glacier du Talèfre , close to the Couvercle Hut . It was identified as that of a young Chamonix guide who had been caught in a winter storm during a solo ascent of the Nant Blanc face of the Aiguille Verte in 1982 and was assumed to have fallen into a crevasse . In 2013 , a box of valuable gemstones was found by a climber on the Bossons Glacier . It had re-emerged , having been carried downhill from the site of one of two Air India plane crashes . These occurred at almost identical locations high up near the summit of Mont Blanc : one in 1950 ( Air India Flight 245 ) , and one in 1966 ( Air India Flight 101 ) . Debris from these crashes is still commonly found on the glacier below

" I have repeatedly expressed reservations about formal educational and funding links with that country .

There are also ways in which Libyan foreign policy has '' not '' changed : the country continues to call for the destruction of Israel ; Muammar Gaddafi recently called for the abolition of Switzerland , and he receives the leader of the Somali pirates operating off the Horn of Africa as honoured guests of state . Moreover , Libya 's handling of the Lockerbie bombing " has not been characterised by either consistency or clarity , " I have in the past , Halliday noted , defended accepting grants from authoritarian regimes such as the Gulf states , " but there should be clear limits on this , depending on the degree of political and human rights abuses perpetrated with them and on their ongoing foreign policy conduct .

		GOLD_MENTION=7 July 2005 London bombings
		CONTEXT=On Oct 4 , 2010 Sayyid Ahmed Amiruddin was asked to appear before the Senate of Canada 's Special Senate Committee on Anti-terrorism to discuss details of his program and share with the committee his insight on the homegrown radicalization process . Amiruddin recommended the proliferation of an integral cultural counter-narrative in the context of being Canadian , and testified before the committee : " Much different from the Israeli – Palestinian conflict equation , the radicalization process of Western‐raised individuals is not triggered by oppression , perceived suffering , revenge or desperation ; rather , this radicalization is motivated specifically by ideology . The jihadi , or the Salafi-jihadist ideology is the ideology that drives young men and women born and raised in the West to carry out " autonomous jihad " via acts of terrorism against their home countries . While many followers of this particular stream of Islam may not directly advocate jihad via acts of terrorism , or may even condemn terrorism wholly , the fact remains that this is the only stream within the Islamic tradition that is directly conducive to the radicalization process and the sanctioning of " autonomous jihad " via acts of terrorism . The Salafi ideology has served as the inspiration for numerous homegrown groups , including the Madrid 2004 bombers ( 2004 Madrid train bombings ) , Amsterdam 's Hofstad Group , London 's July 2005 bombers ( 7 July 2005 London bombings ) , and specifically the Toronto 18 group arrested in 2006 ... In order to create and sustain effective de-radicalization strategies , a major component of counter-terrorism involves the prevention of radicalization through fostering committed partnerships with expert groups within a given community who are working for the de-legitimization of violent extremism . The proliferation of an integral Islamic counter-narrative in the context of being Canadian , and the integration of people at the individual , social , and political level ... The success of our implementation strategy is based on a group of professionals and experts that we deal with to implement our strategy ... For example , we have medical practitioners as advisers in the implementation of our program , such as psychologists and psychiatrists , who can provide guidance and advice on medical and other factors that may be enablers in the radicalization process , which may be surprising to many . Specifically , we deal with hyperreligiosity , which is a diagnosed symptom of bi-polar disorder treated with prescription drugs ... "

" Christopher Orlet of '' The American Spectator '' did not agree with Ahmed 's " identity crisis " . He said , " That 's not an identity crisis , Lord Ahmed , that 's religious psychopathy .

		CONTEXT=After the failure of the 1921 Syrian revolt that he led , al-Qassam escaped to Haifa . According to Shai Lachman , between 1921 and 1935 al-Qassam often cooperated with Mufti of Jerusalem Mohammad Amin al-Husayni . They were on good terms , and al-Qassam 's various official appointments required the mufti 's prior consent . He suggests their cooperation increased after the 1929 riots , in which one source claims al-Qassam 's men were active . The two fell out in the mid-thirties , perhaps due to al-Qassam 's independent line of activism . When the Mufti rejected his plans to divert funding marked for mosque repairs for the purchase of weaponry , Qassam found support in the Arab Nationalist Istiqlal Party . Qassam continued his attempts to forge an alliance with the Mufti in order to attack the British . He was not successful for the Mufti , who headed the Supreme Muslim Council , was still committed to a diplomatic approach at the time .

		CONTEXT=Since the early 2000s , Sinai has been the site of several terror attacks against tourists , the majority of whom are Egyptian .

Attacking the tourist industry was viewed as a method of damaging the industry so that the government would pay more attention to their situation . ( See 2004 Sinai bombings , 2005 Sharm El Sheikh bombings and 2006 Dahab bombings ) . Since the 2011 Egyptian Revolution , unrest has become more prevalent in the area including the 2012 Egyptian-Israeli border attack in which 16 Egyptian soldiers were killed by militants . ( See Sinai insurgency . ) Also on the rise are kidnappings of refugees .

" While those in favour of accepting the donation argued that " Libya is changing internally , " most informed observers agree that while some of the worst excesses for the moment have ceased , the rights of its people are badly protected . Libya " remains a country run by a secretive , erratic and corrupt elite . " Since 9/11 the Libyan government has reached compromises with the West on a number of issues , notably the Lockerbie bombing and nuclear weapons . Yet tactical changes in foreign policy are not sufficient for the purposes of evaluating political and academic links . There are also ways in which Libyan foreign policy has '' not '' changed : the country continues to call for the destruction of Israel ; Muammar Gaddafi recently called for the abolition of Switzerland , and he receives the leader of the Somali pirates operating off the Horn of Africa as honoured guests of state . Moreover , Libya 's handling of the Lockerbie bombing " has not been characterised by either consistency or clarity , " I have in the past , Halliday noted , defended accepting grants from authoritarian regimes such as the Gulf states , " but there should be clear limits on this , depending on the degree of political and human rights abuses perpetrated with them and on their ongoing foreign policy conduct . " Whitehall and the City are now happy to do business with Libya , but it does not follow that the LSE should do the same . Responsible leaders throughout the Middle East continue to express reservations regarding Libya , including " its more prominent ' liberal ' representatives . " We must remember , Halliday concluded , that the " liberal " wing within a regime such as Libya does not have the function of producing change but its role is instead " to reach compromises with internal hard-liners that serve to lessen external pressure . " A good case in point are the proposals LSE now is considering . It is , as LSE alumni in positions of responsibility in the region caution , " far too early for the School to take this step . " In 2009 , Human Rights Watch was allowed entry to Libya , via Saif al-Islam Gaddafi 's non-profit organization in order to gather facts about the human rights situation there . While HRW reported that there were concerns about the " repressive atmosphere , " they felt there were signs of " improvement " and Sarah Leah Whitson , director of HRW 's Middle East division said that one should not " underestimate the importance of the efforts made so far " by Gaddafi in the realm of human rights in Libya . She also wrote of her official visit that " the real impetus for the transformation rests squarely with a quasi-governmental organization , the Qaddafi Foundation for International Charities and Development " chaired by Gaddafi . She praised Gaddafi for establishing the country 's two semi-private newspapers , and said " it is impossible to underestimate the importance of the efforts made so far . Let 's hope this spring will last . " In January 2011 , HRW criticised other organisations as well as governments that had previously dealt with Gaddafi . HRW Business and Human Rights Director Arvind Ganesan condemned the London School of Economics ( LSE ) for allowing " abusive and corrupt officials or their families to launder their images in exchange for money " . This was later followed by Ganesen saying that " the London School of Economics did not act until Saif al-Islam 's father literally began to kill his own people " . According to NGO Monitor , this was despite the fact that David Held , Co-Director of LSE Global Governance , was partially influenced by Whitson 's remarks regarding her Libyan visit , referring to Saif al-Islam Gaddafi as a reformer

" In April 2005 , Coogan 's production firm Baby Cow announced that an Alan Partridge movie was in the pipeline . It was later revealed the film would involve an al-Qaeda siege , but due to the sensitivities of such a storyline after the July 2005 London bombings , the project was put on hold . Playwright Patrick Marber , whose early collaborations with Coogan included '' The Day Today '' and '' Knowing Me , Knowing You ... with Alan Partridge '' , had also been working on the script , while actress Felicity Montagu , who plays Partridge 's personal assistant Lynn , also confirmed that there had been discussions about the film

'' Billboard '' described the album as " supreme " and " very human ... it satisfies with moments of darkness , enlightenment , anger , bittersweet tension , and happiness ... Although 2002 is still young , consider '' Under Rug Swept '' one of the year 's best . " '' Q '' magazine said the album was " a smart shot across the bows ... some of the most inviting music of her career ... Morissette has fashioned a lyrical Trojan Horse to be wheeled into unsuspecting homes for months to come . " Robert Christgau wrote , " The pop-rock here lacks the faux-punk edge on '' Jagged Little Pill '' ... But Morissette instantly demonstrates her gift for the catchy ... topping memorable verse with indelible chorus , she 's a self-actualized nut who goes for what she wants , exactly as pretentious as the college girls she represents for . " According to '' LA Weekly '' , the album " is Alanis Morissette in top form , exercising her God-given right to vent and sound beautiful doing so . " Other critical appraisals were less favorable . '' Rolling Stone '' , in a three-star review , wrote " The music is brawny and meticulous ... but '' Under Rug Swept '' just about drowns in psychobabble . While the tone of the songs , and the grain of Morissette 's voice , promise intimacy , there 's hardly a private detail anywhere . " '' Entertainment Weekly '' said " the album 's garbled title is also preparation for some of the clumsiest lyrics to be heard on a pop record in years ... The songs are riddled with such overwritten Psych 101 ruminations . " '' The Village Voice '' criticised the lyrics , saying " Much like even non-football fans used to be mesmerized by Howard Cosell 's genius for never using two words when 23 would do , you do n't have to be a love-damaged 17-year-old girl to find '' Under Rug Swept '' 's dense verbiage a trip . Words tumble forth and arrange themselves kaleidoscopically into all sorts of unusual categories ... I 'm just not sure that pop music should come out of a thesaurus . " '' NME '' called it " a tedious album " with " overwrought folk-rock like ' Surrendering ' and ' Hands Clean ' destined for a thousand organic juice bars . Lyrically , it 's often hilarious ... This record moves way beyond armchair psychology — in fact , there are armchairs that have a cannier grasp of the mind . " '' Under Rug Swept '' received a Juno Award nomination in the category of " Pop Album of the Year " . Morissette herself won the " Jack Richardson Producer of the Year " award for the songs " Hands Clean " and " So Unsexy " , and she was nominated in the " Artist of the Year " category . ( For more information , see Juno Awards of 2003 . ) '' Under Rug Swept '' entered the Canadian albums chart at number one with first week sales of 35,000 copies , and the CRIA certified it platinum the following month for shipments of 100,000 . In the U.S. the album sold 215,000 copies in its first week , debuting at number one on the '' Billboard '' 200 chart during a busy sales week following the 2002 Grammy Awards ceremony ; it stayed in the top spot for a week .

		GOLD_MENTION=Sundance last January
		CONTEXT=On January 27 , 2011 the festival sent 9 filmmakers to 9 cities across the US to screen and discuss their films . The cities and films included : Bob Tourtellotte of Reuters wrote " Sundance 2011 has proven to be exceptionally strong , audiences and filmmakers seem to agree . " Tourtellotte reported that Robert Redford said that three years ago the Sundance Institute " set out to get back to its roots of supporting alternative voices in cinema and he felt like this year that strategy paid off . " Redford said " This year , what has excited me , is I think the quality is increasing in diversity and is increasing in depth . " The AP reported that Redford said it 's " always a relief " when the festival ends because " it 's really exhausting . " Kenneth Turan , film critic for the '' Los Angeles Times '' , wrote " though the festival has gotten ever bigger — and ( thankfully ) more efficient in moving its close to 50,000 attendees in and out of its far-flung theaters — it still retains the scrappy , antic spirit that has animated it from the start . " Turan wrote " One of the paradoxes of Sundance is that the quirkiness and charm around the edges of the festival are not always fully appreciated because so much of the media focus is on the premieres section and the U.S. dramatic competition " which he said " are , frankly , often the weakest parts of the festival . " Turan said " Sundance 's insistence on giving equal weight to documentaries and dramas has made it into as important a nonfiction showcase as any festival in the world ; witness the fact that four out of the five Oscar-nominated docs this year debuted at Sundance last January . " He also wrote that the foreign language film competition " is a strength at Sundance , and yet that field is given even less popular attention than the documentaries . " Peter Knegt wrote that this year 's festival " probably wo n't replicate last year 's Oscar record . " He said " Despite a huge surge in sales , this year 's Sundance slate looks like it might be the least Oscar-friendly in some time . " He noted that the U.S. Dramatic Grand Jury Prize winners have been nominated for Best Picture for two years ( referring to '' Precious '' and '' Winter 's Bone '' ) . Knegt speculated on films that might be nominated for the Oscars . Films he deemed " most likely to succeed " at being nominated included : '' Like Crazy '' for Best Picture , Michael Shannon of '' Take Shelter '' for Best Actor , Elizabeth Olsen of '' Martha Marcy May Marlene '' for Best Actress , Felicity Jones of '' Like Crazy '' for Best Actress , Jessica Chastain of '' Take Shelter '' for Best Supporting Actress , '' Project Nim '' for Best Documentary Feature , '' Page One '' for Best Documentary Feature , and '' The Interrupters '' for Best Documentary Feature . He wrote " It 's reasonable to feel assured that at least one of Sundance 's docs will end up an Oscar nominee , if not two , three or four . " Jada Yuan of '' New York '' magazine wrote " perhaps the biggest highlight of the festival is just how ripe it 's been for acquisitions , with nearly 30 films getting picked up , the most at any Sundance ever . " On " why everyone is suddenly so bullish on independent film " , Owen Gleiberman wrote that the " energy and optimism at Sundance this year was n't just hype . " He said the factors he thought were driving a new evolving vision of the indie film world included : " The deals have n’t gotten cheaper — they 've gotten smarter " , a belief that last year 's new festival director John Cooper and director of programming Trevor Groth " have re-energized the festival , heightening its quality and organizing the movies with a tempting new shape and vision " , video on demand gives distributors a safety net and more confidence , and the audiences for Sundance movies are not going away , saying " The Oscars ... have become a testament to the central place that Sundance movies now occupy . " Redford was happy about the success of the festival , with about 45 films being sold vs 14 in 2010 , an increase of about 220 % . Redford said studios are realizing " there are audiences " for indie films

The message of the plot is that a lack of sophistication is the key to success , even at a fashion magazine that attracts readers through sexy exhibitionism . The movie would have shown some daring savvy if it had played more with the role-playing aspect of fashion spreads . Instead it is content to eat its retro snack cake and have it , too . " Andrea Gronvall of the '' Chicago Reader '' wrote that " The formula works , thanks in large part to star Jennifer Garner , who 's so radiant theaters should be stocking sunblock . Underlying the shenanigans and the pop-psychology moral — self-love is a prerequisite for true love — there 's a touching wistfulness about roads not taken . " Jorge Morales of '' The Village Voice '' commented : " The thirtysomething in me was all , gag me with a spoon , but the kid in me was like , this movie 's rad to the max . " Garner was nominated for MTV Movie Award and Teen Choice awards for her role as Jenna Rink

		CONTEXT=A 2012 Popchips commercial showing actor Ashton Kutcher with brown make-up on his face impersonating a stereotypical Indian person generated controversy and was eventually pulled by the company after complaints of racism . In the TV series '' Mad Men '' , set in the 1960s in New York City , the character Roger Sterling appears in blackface in the season 3 episode " My Old Kentucky Home " . Robert Downey Jr. appeared in a satirical role as a white Australian actor donning blackface in '' Tropic Thunder '' . Julianne Hough attracted controversy in October 2013 when she donned blackface as part of a Halloween costume depicting the character of " Crazy Eyes " from '' Orange Is the New Black '' . Hough later apologized , stating on Twitter : " I realize my costume hurt and offended people and I truly apologize . " Billy Crystal impersonated Sammy Davis Jr. in the 2012 Oscars opening montage . The scene depicts Crystal in black face paint wearing an oiled wave wig while talking to Justin Bieber . In the scene Crystal leaves a parting remark to Bieber , " Have fun storming the Führer , " a poor association to his famous line in '' The Princess Bride '' , " Have fun storming the castle . " The skit was remarked as poor taste , considering he was chosen as the " safer " choice after Eddie Murphy bowed out following producer and creative partner Brett Ratner 's homophobic remarks

		GOLD_MENTION=2019 Awards
		CONTEXT=During a ceremony , sometimes a celebrity presenter or award winner might not know when they are going to be slimed onstage or offstage , though as the years went on , getting slimed became more of an honor , and less of the comedic humiliation of where the concept originated , with the early Nickelodeon series '' You Ca n't Do That on Television '' . Hosts of the show have also been slimed , especially in recent years , and occasionally celebrities not attending the awards have been slimed via video segment , such as when Rosie O'Donnell tricked Melissa Joan Hart into getting slimed on the set of '' Sabrina the Teenage Witch '' in 2001 , or when Amanda Seyfried and Josh Hutcherson were slimed at a KCA watch party in 2013 . Celebrities sitting in the audience are also fair game for being slimed , as Mandy Moore first learned in 2007 , and Halle Berry later found out in 2012 . Although Les Lye was the only celebrity to be slimed at the 1988 Awards , a video was shown during the show of then Nickelodeon president Geraldine Laybourne saying the magic words and getting slimed with the original '' YCDTOTV '' recipe , much to her dismay , proving that not even the network president was safe from the slime . Last but not least , in addition to the celebrity slimings in 1992 , the entire audience was slimed at the end of the show , which began a long running tradition known as '' The Final Slime '' , which is still in effect as of the 2019 Awards

		CONTEXT=At the Academy Awards , the film received six nominations , including Best Picture , Best Director , Best Supporting Actor for Ruffalo , Best Supporting Actress for McAdams , Best Original Screenplay , and Best Film Editing , winning Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay . It is the first Best Picture winner to win fewer than three Academy Awards since '' The Greatest Show on Earth '' in 1953 . At the time of its win , the film had made $ 39.2 million at the North American box office , which made it the second lowest domestically grossing film ( adjusted for ticket-price inflation ) to win Best Picture within the past four decades ( after '' The Hurt Locker '' with $ 17 million )

		ANSWER=The Silence of the Lambs
		GOLD_MENTION=1991 Academy Award
		CONTEXT=To be eligible for award consideration , the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences requires that a film be shown in a theater in Los Angeles County , California , for at least seven consecutive days during which it is advertised in print media . Studios hoping to position a film for some nominations usually satisfy that minimum requirement , then ease them into wide release from then until the nominations and/or awards ceremony . The flexibility this marketing strategy requires means that screens be available , and studios limit their releases of new films during this time to that end . As critic Ty Burr explained in a 2013 '' New York Times Magazine '' article on the mediocrity of new releases in the first month of the year : " T he studios ... know our attention is elsewhere . " New films shown publicly anywhere for the first time after January 1 themselves are ineligible for Oscars until the following year , by which time they will likely have been forgotten by critics , audiences and voters . '' The Silence of the Lambs '' , winner of the 1991 Academy Award for Best Picture , is a rare exception , as the only film in the post-studio era released in the first two months of its year to go on to win that Oscar . Burr calls it " the grand exception to the January Movies Will Never Amount to Anything rule , " and finds that only one other classic of the late 20th century , '' Dr. Strangelove '' , was a January release . The 2017 satirical horror film '' Get Out '' is another example of a movie released in the months of January and February that went on to be nominated for various Academy Awards such as Best Picture , eventually winning one for Best Original Screenplay

" Television critic Frazier Moore commented that Rock 's performance was a " needed pick-me-up , presiding over the broadcast with saucy finesse . " He added , " In sum , the broadcast felt brisk , though not rushed . It felt modern and refreshingly free of chronic self-importance . " Brian Lowry of '' Variety '' gave an average review of Rock but remarked , " For all the hand-wringing about the awards descending into the muck , the 77th Academy Awards proved a classy affair , with precious little red meat to satiate Hollywood bashers . " The American telecast on ABC drew an average of 42.14 million people over its length , which was a 3 % decrease from the previous year 's ceremony . The show also drew lower Nielsen ratings compared to the two previous ceremonies with 25.4 of households watching over a 38 share .

		CONTEXT=In 1983 , Chéreau directed the film '' The Wounded Man ( L'Homme Blessé '' ) , a more personal project for him . He and his co-writer , Hervé Guibert , worked for six years on the scenario , which tells of a love affair between an older man involved in prostitution and a teenage boy , a dark view in the context of HIV/AIDS . His 1994 film was '' La Reine Margot '' , based on the 1845 historical novel of the same name by Alexandre Dumas . It won the Jury Prize and Best Actress Award ( Virna Lisi ) at Cannes , as well as five César Awards . Set in the 16th-century , depicting the conflict between Catholics and Protestants in France , it shows battles and the St Bartholomew 's day massacre . A scene of the queen with the head of her lover is reminiscent of the opera '' Salome '' , uniting cult and obsession ( " Einheit von Kult und Obsession " ) , as Koch remarks . The film was Chéreau 's longest , most expensive production , and his greatest financial success . " I t was erotic and violent , and offers poured in from Hollywood , " but , he said , " I was always being offered films based in the Renaissance and involving a massacre . I even had an offer from the UK to do a film about Guy Fawkes . " He refused similar offers : " It 's useless to repeat something you already did .

		CONTEXT=Hunt starred in Woody Allen 's '' The Curse of the Jade Scorpion '' ( 2001 ) , as an efficiency expert hypnotized by a crooked hypnotist into stealing jewels . Despite the film 's limited success , Roger Ebert asserted : " Hunt in particular has fun with a wisecracking dame role that owes something , perhaps , to Rosalind Russell in '' His Girl Friday '' . " In 2003 , Hunt returned to Broadway in Yasmina Reza 's '' Life x 3 '' , and in 2004 , she starred in the drama '' A Good Woman '' , as a femme fatale in 1930s NYC . '' AV Club '' , in its review for the latter , remarked : " Helen Hunt looks embarrassingly out of place trying to play an infamous seductress " . She played a socialite , as part of an ensemble cast , in Emilio Estevez 's drama '' Bobby '' ( 2006 ) , about the hours leading up to the Robert F. Kennedy assassination . As a member of the cast , she was nominated for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Cast in a Motion Picture but won the Hollywood Film Festival Award for Best Ensemble Cast . Hunt made her feature film directorial debut in '' Then She Found Me '' ( 2007 ) , in which she also starred as a 39-year-old Brooklyn elementary school teacher , who after years is contacted by the flamboyant host of a local talk show , played by Bette Midler , who introduces herself as her biological mother . After first reading Elinor Lipman 's novel , she tried to interest numerous studios in the material , and her unsuccessful efforts led her to begin writing the screenplay and raising funds to produce it herself . Upon its release , Ruthe Stein of the '' San Francisco Chronicle '' observed , " You would think that frontloading '' Then She Found Me '' with so much plot would make it play like a soap opera . But Hunt saves the movie from this fate in two ways . First she turns in a touchingly real performance , the best of her big-screen career . Forget that '' As Good as It Gets '' won her an Oscar . She 's eons better and more realistic in this one ... By directing '' Then She Found Me '' , Helen becomes its savior as well ... Hunt knows when to rein in the Divine Miss M instead of allowing her to go into full Kabuki mode . She also coaxes pitch-perfect performances from Broderick and Firth . " Hunt starred in the dramedy '' Every Day '' ( 2010 ) , as one half of a married couple pulled apart by increasing responsibilities . According to '' Los Angeles Times '' , the film " comes as a reminder of Hunt 's talent for understatement , and a wish to see more of her " . In the biographical drama '' Soul Surfer '' ( 2011 ) , she played the mother of the Hawaiian-born champion surfer Bethany Hamilton , on whose life the film was based . Her first wide release since 2001 's '' The Curse of the Jade Scorpion '' , '' Soul Surfer '' made US$ 47.1 million internationally . Hunt starred as sex surrogate Cheryl Cohen-Greene in '' The Sessions '' ( 2012 ) , alongside John Hawkes and William H. Macy . The role required Hunt to perform multiple scenes of full-frontal nudity , on which she further said : " Being naked was challenging , but even more than that was the vulnerability . I felt vulnerable because I was naked . I felt vulnerable because we were having such a vulnerable moment in this character 's life . This was a real journey that someone had gone on , and I wanted to do right by that . " Her performance was acclaimed by critics and earned her several award nominations , including an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress . Todd McCarthy of '' The Hollywood Reporter '' wrote : " Hunt 's performance may be physically bold but is equally marked by its maturity and composure . " Hunt played research geneticist Mary-Claire King in the independent drama '' Decoding Annie Parker '' ( 2013 ) , which was released to a mixed critical response . She wrote and directed the drama '' Ride '' ( 2014 ) , in which she also starred as a mother who travels cross-country to California to be with her son after he decides to drop out of school and become a surfer . Rotten Tomatoes ' critical consensus read : " '' Ride '' reaffirms Helen Hunt 's immense acting talent — but suggests that she still needs time to develop as a director . " In '' The Miracle Season '' ( 2018 ) , based on the true story of the Iowa City West High School volleyball team , Hunt played Kathy Bresnahan , a volleyball coach

		CONTEXT=Lease of Life is a 1954 British film drama made by Ealing Studios and directed by Charles Frend . The film was designed as a star - vehicle for Robert Donat , representing his return to the screen after an absence of over three years during which he had been battling the chronic asthma which plagued his life and career . It was a prestige production which was generally respectfully , if not over-enthusiastically , received and gained Donat a nomination as ' Best British Actor ' at the 1955 British Academy Film Awards . In common with a number of other Ealing films of the era , Lease of Life focuses on a specific English milieu – in this case a Yorkshire village and its nearby cathedral city – and examines the nuances , quirks and foibles of its day - to - day life . The film is unique in the Ealing canon in having religion as its dominant theme .

		ANSWER=tang ji
		GOLD_MENTION=
		CONTEXT=Tongan Daopi ( ; ) was a Zen Buddhist monk during the end of the Tang Dynasty and the beginning of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period . Very little is known about him . Traditional biographies record that he was the abbot of Tongan Monastery on Mount Fengchi near modern Nanchang . The earliest source of information on monks of this era is the Zutang ji ( Patriarch 's Hall Record ) , which was completed in 952 , but it fails to mention Tongan Daopi as a disciple of his supposed teacher Yunju Daoying . The Zutang ji does , however , record someone with the name Tongan asking a question to Yunju Daoying . The scholar Ui Hakuju has written this could likely refer to Tongan Daopi . He is first explicitly mentioned in the Transmission of the Lamp , which was compiled around 1004 . However , in that work , it does not mention Tongan Daopi as having any disciples . The commonly accepted version of his lineage holds that Tongan Guanzhi is Tongan Daopi 's successor . However , this comes from Huihong 's Sengbao zhuan , which was completed in 1119 , much longer after Tongan 's death than the other works . The Transmission of the Lamp instead claims that Tongan Guanzhi is the disciple of a Tongan Wei , in turn a student of Jufeng Puman , with Jufeng being an apparently obscure student of the famous Dongshan Liangjie . Both Tongan Wei and Jufeng Puman are listed for the first time in the Transmission of the Lamp , and neither with much information . However , Dayang Jingxuan , who in Huihong 's version of the lineage is a descendant of Tonagan Daopi , is recorded in the Transmission of the Lamp as being descended through Jufeng Puman and Tongan Wei . Dayang was close with Wang Shu , one of the compilers of Transmission of the Lamp , suggesting that it is unlikely that an error would have been made therein about his lineage . This suggests that Tongan Guanzhi is much more likely to have been a student of Tongan Wei and not Tongan Daopi as commonly accepted .

		CONTEXT=Perhaps the best known appearance of Cephalonia in popular culture is in the novel '' Captain Corelli 's Mandolin '' , by the English author Louis de Bernières .

During filming there was lively debate between the production team , local authorities as well as groups of citizens , as to the complex historical details of the island 's antifascist resistance . As a result , political references were omitted from the film , and the romantic core of the book was preserved , without entering complex debates about the island 's history .

		CONTEXT=Charles Edward was imprisoned until 1946 . He was originally charged with Crimes against humanity and the trial was held . Though he was exonerated of complicity in actual war crimes , he was judged to have been " an important Nazi " . Only his failing health saved him from remaining in prison . Another factor for leniency towards him was the fact that in April 1946 , his daughter Sybilla had given birth to a son , the future King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden , who became , upon birth , third-in-line to the Swedish throne . In January 1947 , Sybilla 's husband died in a plane crash , and in October 1950 , King Gustaf V of Sweden died , at which point Charles Edward 's grandson became the Crown Prince of Sweden . In that same year 1950 ( or August 1949 , according to his ODNB entry ) , after several appeals , Charles Edward was sentenced by a denazification court as a '' Mitläufer '' and '' Minderbelasteter '' ( roughly : follower and of lesser guilt ) , fined ( DM 5,000 ) and almost bankrupted . Had he been convicted for the greater charge of " crimes against humanity , " he would have been liable for a death sentence , and even otherwise , to criminalize the future king 's grandfather for " crimes against humanity " would lead to major embarrassment in the immediate term and could have ramifications in years to come . The lesser sentence was therefore handed out

The Minister of Agriculture – a communist – pushed for reforms in which peasants were to get larger shares of produce , be allowed to form cooperatives and take over badly used land , and remove the system by which leaseholders ( known as '' " gabelloti " '' ) could rent land from landowners for their own short-term use . Owners of especially large estates were to be forced to sell off some of their land . The Mafia had connections to many landowners and murdered many socialist reformers . The most notorious attack was the Portella della Ginestra massacre , when 11 people were killed and 33 wounded during May Day celebrations on May 1 , 1947 .

		CONTEXT=Oliver Sava of '' The A.V. Club '' awarded the episode an " A " , calling it " a fascinating psychological horror story about a boy shedding everything that defines him in order to move on to the next phase of his life . " Sava noted that while the episode was humorous , much of the comedy was undercut by the tragic and distressing nature of Finn 's story . Andrew Tran of Overmental argued that " the episode ... dissects vividly that bottomless feeling of midlife wanderlust ... not the road-trippy , running-through-the-fields kind but rather the life-map-disappearing-in-your-hands , what-the-hell-is-next kind . " Tran contended that , through the use of video game tropes , explores the idea that life is ultimately unpredictable that there " is no map that you can make for yourself ( or that anyone can give you ) that can account for everything you ’re going to encounter " . " The Hall of Egress " has been highly lauded by the show 's production staff , with series creator Pendleton Ward in particular naming it as one of his favorites .

		CONTEXT=The Chetnik Command ( ) was a military operation plan of the Yugoslav government in an expected invasion of Yugoslavia . It was part of the military plans to lead guerrilla warfare , earlier developed . It was established in April 1940 , including the organization of six complete and one incomplete battalion recruited from the regular Royal Yugoslav Army on voluntary basis . The six battalions ( known as " assault battalions " , , or " Chetnik battalions " , ) were added to each Field Army ( of which there were seven ) , placed in Novi Sad , Sarajevo , Skopje , Karlovac , Niš and Mostar . Its headquarters was transferred from Novi Sad to Kraljevo in south - central Serbia on 1 April . Between 10 July 1940 and 1 April 1941 the official name was the Assault Command ( ) . Although a traditional notion , the Yugoslav military did not use the Chetnik idea in its military planning until 1940 . It had little support in the highest ranks whose views were formed in World War I . It had the rank of Division , and was directly subordinated to the Ministry of the Army and Navy . The first commander was division general ( ) Mihailo Mihailović . It was activated on 1 April 1941 and saw action in the April War ( 6 – 18 April 1941 ) . The Chetnik Command had no relation to the pre-war Chetnik associations and the later Chetnik Movement of Draža Mihailović .

		CONTEXT=Not long after the launch of Operation Barbarossa Visaitov first saw combat against German forces in June 1941 as a squadron commander in the 34th Cavalry Regiment on the Southwestern Front . During the defense of Ukraine on 24 July 1941 he was wounded in the left shoulder and treated in a hospital until the end of August . After recovering he participated in the defense of Kiev as commander of a separate reconnaissance battalion of the 206th Rifle Division . On 19 September 1941 while the division was encircled near the city of Boryspil , Visaitov took command of over 200 men and managed to reunite them with troops in Donbas . He went on to take part in the defense of Rostov-on-Don before he sustained frostbite in his hand and severely injured his right leg in November 1941 . He was sent to a hospital in Pyatigorsk where he remained recovering until the beginning of 1942 , after which he was appointed as the chief of staff of the newly formed 255th Separate Chechen-Ingush Cavalry Regiment , which was initially placed under the command of Yaponts Abadiyev ; later Abadiyev was appointed to a different position and Visaitov was made the commander of the regiment on 13 May 1942 . From the very beginning of the Battle of Stalingrad the regiment saw heavy battle ; on 3 August 1942 while covering the retreat of Soviet troops the regiment was engaged by the 78th Tank Corps of the Wehrmacht near Kotelnikovo . During the engagement the regiment took out four German tanks but suffered heavy losses from both German tanks and aviation-based attacks from numerically superior forces . Facing constant bombardment and high casualties , the regiment was forced to retreat , and after suffering further losses in Stalingrad the regiment was divided into two independent reconnaissance battalions for the 4th Cavalry Corps . Visaitov himself had expressed his disagreement with orders to send horsemen to fight against heavily armored German tanks , and he was punished for expressing such concerns ; but members of his regiment appreciated that he did not want to lead them to a certain death . As the regiment was being dissolved , in October 1942 Visaitov was placed in command of one of the separate reconnaissance battalions , and remained in that position until January 1943 , after which he was placed in charge of cavalry courses which trained junior lieutenants of the Southern Front . In September that same year he was reassigned again as an assistant inspector of cavalry , and fought in battles throughout Ukraine until he was expelled from his post into the reserve in May 1944 because he was Chechen ; in February 1944 the entire Chechen nation was declared to be traitors , and the civilian population was deported to Central Asia

		ANSWER=" happy evidence of the will to objectivity on the part of a foreigner "
		GOLD_MENTION=Stalinist terror
		CONTEXT=The crux of Nolte 's thesis was presented when he wrote : " It is a notable shortcoming of the literature about National Socialism that it does not know or does not want to admit to what degree all the deeds — with the sole exception of the technical process of gassing — that the National Socialists later committed had already been described in a voluminous literature of the early 1920s : mass deportations and shootings , torture , death camps , extermination of entire groups using strictly objective selection criteria , and public demands for the annihilation of millions of guiltless people who were thought to be " enemies " . It is probable that many of these reports were exaggerated . It is certain that the “ White Terror ” also committed terrible deeds , even though its program contained no analogy to the “ extermination of the bourgeoisie ” . Nonetheless , the following question must seem permissible , even unavoidable : Did the National Socialists or Hitler perhaps commit an “ Asiatic ” deed merely because they and their ilk considered themselves to be the potential victims of an “ Asiatic ” deed ? Was n’t the ' Gulag Archipelago ' more original than Auschwitz ? Was the Bolshevik murder of an entire class not the logical and factual '' prius '' of the " racial murder " of National Socialism ? Can not Hitler 's most secret deeds be explained by the fact that he had '' not '' forgotten the rat cage ? Did Auschwitz in its root causes not originate in a past that would not pass ? " Nolte wrote the principle problem " for the coming generations ... must be liberation from collectivist thinking " , which Nolte claimed dominated scholarship on Nazi Germany . Nolte ended his essay with calling for a " more comprehensive debate " about the memory of Nazi Germany that would allow for " the past that will not go away " to finally go away " as is suitable for every past " . Nolte subsequently presented a 1940 book by American author Theodore N. Kaufman entitled '' Germany Must Perish ! '' . The text contends that all German men should be sterilized , evidencing , according to Nolte , the alleged " Jewish " desire to " annihilate " Germans prior to the Holocaust . An August 1941 appeal to the world by a group of Soviet Jews seeking support against Germany was also cited by Nolte as evidence of Jewish determination to thwart the '' Reich '' . Nolte argued that the Nazis felt forced to undertake the Holocaust by Hitler 's conclusion that the entire Jewish population of the world had declared war on Germany . From Nolte 's point of view , the Holocaust was an act of “ Asiatic barbarism ” forced on the Germans by the fear of what Joseph Stalin , whom Nolte believed to have significant Jewish support , might do to them . Nolte contends that the U.S. internment of Japanese Americans in the wake of the Pearl Harbor attack provides a parallel to the German " internment " of the Jewish population of Europe in concentration camps , in light of what Nolte alleges was the " Jewish " declaration of war on Germany in 1939 which Weizmann 's letter allegedly constitutes . Subsequently , Nolte expanded upon these views in his 1987 book '' Der europäische Bürgerkrieg , 1917 – 1945 '' ( '' The European Civil War , 1917 – 1945 '' ) in which he claimed that the entire 20th century was an age of genocide , totalitarianism , and tyranny , and that the Holocaust had been merely one chapter in the age of violence , terror and population displacement . Nolte claimed that this age had started with the genocide of the Armenians during World War I , and also included the Stalinist terror in the Soviet Union , the expulsion of ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe , Maoist terror in China as manifested in such events as the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution , compulsory population exchanges between Greece and Turkey from 1922 to 1923 , American war crimes in the Vietnam War , the Khmer Rouge genocide in Cambodia , and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan . In particular , Nolte argued that the expulsion of ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe in 1945 – 46 was " to be categorized ... under the concept of genocide " . As part of this argument , Nolte cited the 1979 book of the American historian Alfred-Maurice de Zayas , '' Die Wehrmacht Untersuchungsstelle '' , which argues that the Allies were just as guilty of war crimes as the Germans as the " happy evidence of the will to objectivity on the part of a foreigner " In Nolte 's opinion , Hitler was a " European citizen " who fought in defence of the values of the West against " Asiatic " Bolshevism , but due to his " total egocentrism " waged this struggle with unnecessary violence and brutality Since in Nolte 's view , the '' Shoah '' was not a unique crime , there is no reason to single out Germans for special criticism for the Holocaust . In addition , Nolte sees his work as the beginning of a much-needed revisionist treatment to end the " negative myth " of the Third Reich that dominates contemporary perceptions . Nolte took the view that the principle problem of German history was this “ negative myth ” of the Third Reich , which cast the Nazi era as the '' ne plus ultra '' of evil . Nolte wrote that after the American Civil War , the defeated South was cast as the symbol of total evil by the victorious North , but later “ revisionism ” became the dominant historical interpretation against the “ negative myth ” of the South , which led to a more balanced history of the Civil War with a greater understanding of the “ motives and way of life of the defeated Southern states ” , and led to the leaders of the Confederacy becoming great American heroes . Nolte urged that a similar “ revisionism ” destroy the “ negative myth ” of the Third Reich . Nolte argued that the Vietnam War , the Khmer Rouge genocide , the expulsion of " boat people " from Vietnam , the Islamic revolution in Iran , and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan meant the traditional picture of Nazi Germany as the ultimate in evil was no longer tenable , and proved the need for " revisionism " to put an end to the " negative myth " of the Third Reich . In Nolte 's view , the first efforts at revisionism of the Nazi period failed because A. J. P. Taylor 's 1961 book '' The Origins of the Second World War '' was only a part of the " anti-German literature of indictment " while David Hoggan in '' Der erzwugnene Krieg '' , by only seeking to examine why World War II broke out in 1939 , " cut himself off from the really decisive questions " . Then the next revisionist efforts Nolte cites were the Italian historian Domenico Settembrini 's favorable treatment of Fascism for saving Italy from Communism , and the British historian Timothy Mason 's studies in working class German history . The best of the revisionists according to Nolte is David Irving , with whom Nolte finds some fault , although " not all of Irving 's theses and points can be dismissed with such ease " . Nolte praises Irving as the first to understand that Weizmann 's letter to Chamberlain was a " Jewish declaration of war " on Germany that justified the " interning " of the Jews of Europe . Nolte went on to praise Irving for putting the Holocaust " in a more comprehensive perspective " by comparing it to the British fire-bombing of Hamburg in 1943 , which Nolte views as just much of an act of genocide as the " Final Solution " . The sort of revisionism needed to end the " negative myth " of the Third Reich is , in Nolte 's opinion , an examination of the impact of the Russian Revolution on Germany

In 1943 , Hungary started secret armistice negotiations with the Allied Powers which was discovered by Germany resulting in the German occupation of Vojvodina . Soon after , at the age of 17 , Moscovich was taken to the concentration camp at Auschwitz with his grandfather , grandmother and mother . His grandparents were immediately taken to the crematoria and were killed . While his mother stayed in Auschwitz , Moscovich was moved to Wustegiersdorf , one of the surrounding work camps , laying rail lines . In January 1945 , Auschwitz was evacuated and Moscovich along with 60,000 prisoners marched west to Bergen-Belsen . After only a few days , Moscovich volunteered for a selection of 500 volunteer prisoner workers . These volunteers were sent to clear the railway station in Hildesheim by dislodging the wagons to free the rails so they could be fixed and used for German transports . While there , several groups found food supplies including sugar , butter , and eggs . On March 22 , Hildesheim was bombed killing or wounding both prisoners and German guards . The volunteers were made to move the bodies for easier identification . They were then marched to the Hannover-Ahlem prison camp . The prisoners worked in an asbestos mine converting it into an ammunition depot safe from aerial attacks . Hannover-Ahlem was evacuated on April 6 , 1945 and Moscovich marched towards Bergen-Belsen again . Moscovich describes the last days in Bergen-Belsen as “ the ultimate in human misery , suffering , degradation , death and humiliation . ” He hid himself among a pile of dead bodies to avoid the Germans

After Italy 's surrender to the Allies on 3 September 1943 the divisions commanding general Antonio Gandin was left without clear orders from his superiors . Therefore , Gandin decided to let his soldiers vote on 13 September 1943 as to what to do to next . The troops voted overwhelmingly to fight their former allies the Germans , thus the '' Acqui '' became one of the very few Italian units to actively resist the Germans . The Germans therefore summarily executed over half of the divisions soldiers and all of its officers in revenge during the Massacre of the Acqui Division

		CONTEXT=Oliver Sava of '' The A.V. Club '' awarded the episode an " A " , calling it " a fascinating psychological horror story about a boy shedding everything that defines him in order to move on to the next phase of his life . " Sava noted that while the episode was humorous , much of the comedy was undercut by the tragic and distressing nature of Finn 's story . Andrew Tran of Overmental argued that " the episode ... dissects vividly that bottomless feeling of midlife wanderlust ... not the road-trippy , running-through-the-fields kind but rather the life-map-disappearing-in-your-hands , what-the-hell-is-next kind . " Tran contended that , through the use of video game tropes , explores the idea that life is ultimately unpredictable that there " is no map that you can make for yourself ( or that anyone can give you ) that can account for everything you ’re going to encounter " . " The Hall of Egress " has been highly lauded by the show 's production staff , with series creator Pendleton Ward in particular naming it as one of his favorites . According to the crew , " It was just so thoughtfully done . " At the 68th Primetime Emmy Awards in 2016 , " The Hall of Egress " was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Short-format Animation .

		ANSWER=" happy evidence of the will to objectivity on the part of a foreigner
		GOLD_MENTION=Stalinist terror
		CONTEXT=The crux of Nolte 's thesis was presented when he wrote : " It is a notable shortcoming of the literature about National Socialism that it does not know or does not want to admit to what degree all the deeds — with the sole exception of the technical process of gassing — that the National Socialists later committed had already been described in a voluminous literature of the early 1920s : mass deportations and shootings , torture , death camps , extermination of entire groups using strictly objective selection criteria , and public demands for the annihilation of millions of guiltless people who were thought to be " enemies " . It is probable that many of these reports were exaggerated . It is certain that the “ White Terror ” also committed terrible deeds , even though its program contained no analogy to the “ extermination of the bourgeoisie ” . Nonetheless , the following question must seem permissible , even unavoidable : Did the National Socialists or Hitler perhaps commit an “ Asiatic ” deed merely because they and their ilk considered themselves to be the potential victims of an “ Asiatic ” deed ? Was n’t the ' Gulag Archipelago ' more original than Auschwitz ? Was the Bolshevik murder of an entire class not the logical and factual '' prius '' of the " racial murder " of National Socialism ? Can not Hitler 's most secret deeds be explained by the fact that he had '' not '' forgotten the rat cage ? Did Auschwitz in its root causes not originate in a past that would not pass ? " Nolte wrote the principle problem " for the coming generations ... must be liberation from collectivist thinking " , which Nolte claimed dominated scholarship on Nazi Germany . Nolte ended his essay with calling for a " more comprehensive debate " about the memory of Nazi Germany that would allow for " the past that will not go away " to finally go away " as is suitable for every past " . Nolte subsequently presented a 1940 book by American author Theodore N. Kaufman entitled '' Germany Must Perish ! '' . The text contends that all German men should be sterilized , evidencing , according to Nolte , the alleged " Jewish " desire to " annihilate " Germans prior to the Holocaust . An August 1941 appeal to the world by a group of Soviet Jews seeking support against Germany was also cited by Nolte as evidence of Jewish determination to thwart the '' Reich '' . Nolte argued that the Nazis felt forced to undertake the Holocaust by Hitler 's conclusion that the entire Jewish population of the world had declared war on Germany . From Nolte 's point of view , the Holocaust was an act of “ Asiatic barbarism ” forced on the Germans by the fear of what Joseph Stalin , whom Nolte believed to have significant Jewish support , might do to them . Nolte contends that the U.S. internment of Japanese Americans in the wake of the Pearl Harbor attack provides a parallel to the German " internment " of the Jewish population of Europe in concentration camps , in light of what Nolte alleges was the " Jewish " declaration of war on Germany in 1939 which Weizmann 's letter allegedly constitutes . Subsequently , Nolte expanded upon these views in his 1987 book '' Der europäische Bürgerkrieg , 1917 – 1945 '' ( '' The European Civil War , 1917 – 1945 '' ) in which he claimed that the entire 20th century was an age of genocide , totalitarianism , and tyranny , and that the Holocaust had been merely one chapter in the age of violence , terror and population displacement . Nolte claimed that this age had started with the genocide of the Armenians during World War I , and also included the Stalinist terror in the Soviet Union , the expulsion of ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe , Maoist terror in China as manifested in such events as the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution , compulsory population exchanges between Greece and Turkey from 1922 to 1923 , American war crimes in the Vietnam War , the Khmer Rouge genocide in Cambodia , and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan . In particular , Nolte argued that the expulsion of ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe in 1945 – 46 was " to be categorized ... under the concept of genocide " . As part of this argument , Nolte cited the 1979 book of the American historian Alfred-Maurice de Zayas , '' Die Wehrmacht Untersuchungsstelle '' , which argues that the Allies were just as guilty of war crimes as the Germans as the " happy evidence of the will to objectivity on the part of a foreigner " In Nolte 's opinion , Hitler was a " European citizen " who fought in defence of the values of the West against " Asiatic " Bolshevism , but due to his " total egocentrism " waged this struggle with unnecessary violence and brutality Since in Nolte 's view , the '' Shoah '' was not a unique crime , there is no reason to single out Germans for special criticism for the Holocaust . In addition , Nolte sees his work as the beginning of a much-needed revisionist treatment to end the " negative myth " of the Third Reich that dominates contemporary perceptions . Nolte took the view that the principle problem of German history was this “ negative myth ” of the Third Reich , which cast the Nazi era as the '' ne plus ultra '' of evil . Nolte wrote that after the American Civil War , the defeated South was cast as the symbol of total evil by the victorious North , but later “ revisionism ” became the dominant historical interpretation against the “ negative myth ” of the South , which led to a more balanced history of the Civil War with a greater understanding of the “ motives and way of life of the defeated Southern states ” , and led to the leaders of the Confederacy becoming great American heroes . Nolte urged that a similar “ revisionism ” destroy the “ negative myth ” of the Third Reich . Nolte argued that the Vietnam War , the Khmer Rouge genocide , the expulsion of " boat people " from Vietnam , the Islamic revolution in Iran , and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan meant the traditional picture of Nazi Germany as the ultimate in evil was no longer tenable , and proved the need for " revisionism " to put an end to the " negative myth " of the Third Reich . In Nolte 's view , the first efforts at revisionism of the Nazi period failed because A. J. P. Taylor 's 1961 book '' The Origins of the Second World War '' was only a part of the " anti-German literature of indictment " while David Hoggan in '' Der erzwugnene Krieg '' , by only seeking to examine why World War II broke out in 1939 , " cut himself off from the really decisive questions " . Then the next revisionist efforts Nolte cites were the Italian historian Domenico Settembrini 's favorable treatment of Fascism for saving Italy from Communism , and the British historian Timothy Mason 's studies in working class German history . The best of the revisionists according to Nolte is David Irving , with whom Nolte finds some fault , although " not all of Irving 's theses and points can be dismissed with such ease " . Nolte praises Irving as the first to understand that Weizmann 's letter to Chamberlain was a " Jewish declaration of war " on Germany that justified the " interning " of the Jews of Europe . Nolte went on to praise Irving for putting the Holocaust " in a more comprehensive perspective " by comparing it to the British fire-bombing of Hamburg in 1943 , which Nolte views as just much of an act of genocide as the " Final Solution " . The sort of revisionism needed to end the " negative myth " of the Third Reich is , in Nolte 's opinion , an examination of the impact of the Russian Revolution on Germany

The full title of this poem is Autumn Day in Kui Prefecture , A Song Submitted to Supervisor Zheng and Advisor Li , in One Hundred Rhymes ( according to title translation by Alfreda Murck ) . As a poem , " Autumn Day in Kui Prefecture " is an example of Tang poetry , which received considerable attention during the Song dynasty , in Song poetry , and later , even through modern times . During the Song dynasty Du Fu 's " Autumn Day in Kui Prefecture " received particular attention , with the poem being subtly alluded to through rhyme - scheme referencing by Su Shi and his circle : in other words , Su Shi and the poets of his circle wrote poems which utilized the same rhyming words from Du Fu 's poem , thus subtly referencing the sense and sentiment of Du Fu 's line , but without overtly stating what might be censured as inappropriate . This allowed him and others to express opinions about government and society , without suffering the consequences , as Su Shi had previously done , in the Crow Terrace Poetry Trial , when his poetry was used as evidence resulting in his conviction and exile .

		GOLD_MENTION=in a plane crash
		CONTEXT=Charles Edward was imprisoned until 1946 . He was originally charged with Crimes against humanity and the trial was held . Though he was exonerated of complicity in actual war crimes , he was judged to have been " an important Nazi " . Only his failing health saved him from remaining in prison . Another factor for leniency towards him was the fact that in April 1946 , his daughter Sybilla had given birth to a son , the future King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden , who became , upon birth , third-in-line to the Swedish throne . In January 1947 , Sybilla 's husband died in a plane crash , and in October 1950 , King Gustaf V of Sweden died , at which point Charles Edward 's grandson became the Crown Prince of Sweden . In that same year 1950 ( or August 1949 , according to his ODNB entry ) , after several appeals , Charles Edward was sentenced by a denazification court as a '' Mitläufer '' and '' Minderbelasteter '' ( roughly : follower and of lesser guilt ) , fined ( DM 5,000 ) and almost bankrupted . Had he been convicted for the greater charge of " crimes against humanity , " he would have been liable for a death sentence , and even otherwise , to criminalize the future king 's grandfather for " crimes against humanity " would lead to major embarrassment in the immediate term and could have ramifications in years to come . The lesser sentence was therefore handed out

		GOLD_MENTION=Preparedness Day Bombing
		CONTEXT=In September 1917 , he was appointed counsel to a commission , the President 's Mediation Committee , established by President Wilson to resolve major strikes threatening war production . Among the disturbances he investigated were the 1916 Preparedness Day Bombing in San Francisco , where he argued strongly that the radical leader Thomas Mooney had been framed and required a new trial . He also examined the copper industry in Arizona , where industry bosses solved industrial relations problems by having more than 1,000 strikers forcibly deported to New Mexico . Overall , Frankfurter 's work gave him an opportunity to learn firsthand about labor politics and extremism , including anarchism , communism and revolutionary socialism . He came to sympathize with labor issues , arguing that " unsatisfactory , remediable social conditions , if unattended , give rise to radical movements far transcending the original impulse . " His activities led the public to view him as a radical lawyer and supporter of radical principles . Former President Theodore Roosevelt accused him of being " engaged in excusing men precisely like the Bolsheviki in Russia . " Frankfurter and Supreme Court justice Louis Brandeis secretly collaborated over many years on numerous covert political activities . The relationship began after Brandeis secured Frankfurter a position at Harvard through Jacob Schiff . Brandeis enlisted Frankfurter as his paid political lobbyist and lieutenant . In May 1917 when U.S. Secretary of State Robert Lansing received a report that the Ottomans were extremely weary of the war and that it might be possible to induce them to break with Germany and make a separate peace with Britain , Brandeis and Frankfurter worked to prevent this from occurring . Frankfurter became part of the delegation and persuaded the delegation ’s leader , former Ambassador Henry J. Morgenthau , to abandon the effort . This was described in books by Jehuda Reinharz , Peter Grose , Peter Balakian , and Charles Glass , as reported in '' Against Our Better Judgement '' , by Alison Weir

This second extension led to the MEU returning home a month later than originally scheduled .

		ANSWER=Barry Gifford remembers that there was a prevailing mood that the media was hoping Lynch would fail .
		GOLD_MENTION=1990 Cannes Film Festival
		CONTEXT=Early test screenings did not go well , with the strong violence in some scenes being too much . At the first test screening , eighty people walked out during a graphic torture scene involving Johnnie Farragut . Lynch decided not to cut anything from the film and at the second screening one hundred people walked out during this scene . Lynch remembers , " By then , I knew the scene was killing the film . So I cut it to the degree that it was powerful but did n't send people running from the theatre " . In retrospect , the filmmaker said , " But that was part of what '' Wild at Heart '' was about : really insane and sick and twisted stuff going on . " The film was completed one day before it debuted at the 1990 Cannes Film Festival in the 2,400-seat Grand Auditorium . After the screening , it received " wild cheering " from the audience . When Jury President Bernardo Bertolucci announced '' Wild at Heart '' as the Palme d'Or winner at the awards ceremony , the boos almost drowned out the cheers , with film critic Roger Ebert leading the vocal detractors . Barry Gifford remembers that there was a prevailing mood that the media was hoping Lynch would fail . " All kinds of journalists were trying to cause controversy and have me say something like ' This is nothing like the book ' or ' He ruined my book ' . I think everybody from '' Time '' magazine to '' What 's On In London '' was disappointed when I said ' This is fantastic . This is wonderful . It 's like a big , dark , musical comedy ' "

		CONTEXT=I. M. ( Isaac Meir ) Weissenberg ( 1878/1881 , Żelechów - August 13 , 1938 , Warsaw ) was a Yiddish - language writer in Warsaw , Poland . A disciple of I.L. Peretz , he began writing in 1904 and gained recognition for his 1906 masterpiece " A Shtetl " ( A Town ) . This novella , still regarded as his major achievement , was a literary response to a story by Sholem Asch called " The Shtetl " . Unlike Asch 's sentimental view of Eastern European Jewish unity in the waning years of the Russian Empire , Weissenberg used a naturalistic form to explore the deep divides between Jews , usually along class lines . In the process , he " stressed the impact of the new revolutionary doctrines upon the townlets , rousing them from their lethargy and shattering their foundations " ( Liptzin , p. 257 ) . ( See Shtetl for more on the history of these towns ) . " Almost alone among Yiddish writers , Weissenberg was a worker and the son of workers , " critic Ruth Wisse notes ( p. 27 ) , a fact which shaped both his subject matter and his use of language . He wrote several novels and plays , but remained a consistently strong writer of novellas and short stories .

The Royal Albert Hall was reportedly unavailable , so in August 2004 the EBU announced that DR would stage the event instead . Eurovision Song Contest supervisor Svante Stockselius said that Denmark 's previous experience of hosting Eurovision events ( the 2001 Contest and the first Junior Eurovision Song Contest in 2003 ) were influential in the Union 's choice . The event was codenamed '' Extravaganza '' . 1998 Eurovision winner Dana International , who appeared at the event , later went to suggest that the reason behind the change of host country was also due to the fact that the BBC wanted to present the show " with humour " as though to poke fun at the Contest , an idea that proved to be less popular with the EBU . The BBC went on to broadcast their own 50th anniversary program , '' Boom Bang-a-Bang : 50 Years of Eurovision '' , in May 2006

At Gothenburg , the song was performed fourteenth on the night , after Norway 's Bobbysocks with " La det swinge " , and before Switzerland 's Mariella Farré and Pino Gasparini with " Piano , piano . " At the end of judging that evening , " Love Is " took the fourth-place slot with 100 points . At the time , it was one of the few entries that managed to receive 100 points without receiving any 12 point allotments from any jury . It was also the UK 's strongest showing since winning the 1981 Contest with " Making Your Mind Up . " The song was a contemporary ballad about a man and a woman who are both too afraid to plunge head-first with their emotions into a love affair ; while both of them want to be loved by the other , both of them are letting their heads rule their hearts . In the chorus , Vikki sings that " love is " the product of a number of impulsive decisions , such as " taking a chance on two hearts beating as one . " Vikki nominally used a single chair as a prop , first sitting in it while singing the song , then circling it and abandoning it entirely by the second half of the song

		CONTEXT=Although Greece had been granted a spot in the 2008 final because of its seventh-place finish at the Eurovision Song Contest 2007 , it had to compete in a semi-final for the first time since 2004 because of new rules put into effect by the European Broadcasting Union ( EBU ) . In previous years , countries that received a top 10 placing were automatically granted a spot in the next year 's final without having to compete in a semi-final , but for 2008 , the EBU changed the automatic qualification regulations so that all countries except the " Big 4 " ( France , Germany , Spain , and the United Kingdom ) and host country , would have to pass through one of two semi-finals . The EBU split up countries with a friendly voting history into separate semi-finals , to give a better chance for other countries to win . Greece and Cyprus had often been accused of favoring each other , with each awarding the other the maximum number of points ( twelve ) at the previous contest . On January 28 , 2008 , the EBU held a special draw which determined that Greece would be in '' Semi-final 1 '' held on May 20 , 2008 in Belgrade , Serbia ; Cyprus was subsequently placed in the second semi-final

Prior to the contest , " Ik hou van jou " had been fancied to do well so its final placing of 13th out of the 19 entries was very disappointing . ( Although Maribelle had given a confident performance , there was considerable criticism afterwards of the unflattering outfit in which she had appeared on stage . ) Despite its poor Eurovision performance , " Ik hou van jou " has gone on to be an enduring and popular song in the Dutch language market , having been covered successfully by Gordon Heuckeroth , Dana Winner , Thomaz and Roxeanne Hazes

The event was to be held on 16 October 2005 at the Royal Albert Hall in London , England . The BBC was to be the host broadcaster for the concert . The Royal Albert Hall was reportedly unavailable , so in August 2004 the EBU announced that DR would stage the event instead . Eurovision Song Contest supervisor Svante Stockselius said that Denmark 's previous experience of hosting Eurovision events ( the 2001 Contest and the first Junior Eurovision Song Contest in 2003 ) were influential in the Union 's choice . The event was codenamed '' Extravaganza '' . 1998 Eurovision winner Dana International , who appeared at the event , later went to suggest that the reason behind the change of host country was also due to the fact that the BBC wanted to present the show " with humour " as though to poke fun at the Contest , an idea that proved to be less popular with the EBU .

Richard Harrington of '' The Washington Post '' deemed the song " a powerful exploration of exhaustion and depression . " Alex Pappademas , writing for '' Spin '' , compared the song to the music of Weezer . Katy Kroll of '' Billboard '' recognized it among her top 10 singles of 2000 , calling it " a good old-fashioned depressing song with mainstream flair . " Geoff Boucher , writing for the '' Los Angeles Times '' , called it " a poignant essay on a teen mulling over suicide " ; conversely , Steve Appleford of the '' Los Angeles Times '' dubbed it a " moving if unremarkable examination . " Scott Mervis of the '' Pittsburgh Post-Gazette '' called it a " rare departure from the usual Blink fare . " Writers for '' The A.V. Club '' listed it among other suicide-related songs in 2009 , describing it as " surprisingly affecting , especially when the band reaches the bombastic chorus , and when the song describes suicide 's crushing aftermath . " In a retrospective review , Chris Payne of '' Billboard '' wrote , " Stylistically , it 's also a Blink breakthrough : rather than putting their heads down and plowing through at breakneck speed , the band dials back the verses and interludes to let them breathe a bit . The resulting chorus achieves an arena-worthy feel not achieved anywhere else on '' Enema of the State '' . " The song caused a controversy in 2000 when it was set to replay indefinitely on a nearby stereo as 17-year-old Greg Barnes , a teenager who attended Columbine High School and had lost one of his best friends in the massacre the previous year , hanged himself in the garage of his family 's home . Both Hoppus and DeLonge were sympathetic but stressed the song 's meaning during an MTV News interview in 2001 : Hoppus also told interviewers that he received fan mail following the song 's release from fans that had contemplated suicide , but decided not to go through with it after hearing the song . '' Rolling Stone '' compared the controversy to that of Ozzy Osbourne 's " Suicide Solution " , which similarly was playing as a teen committed suicide

" While those in favour of accepting the donation argued that " Libya is changing internally , " most informed observers agree that while some of the worst excesses for the moment have ceased , the rights of its people are badly protected . Libya " remains a country run by a secretive , erratic and corrupt elite . " Since 9/11 the Libyan government has reached compromises with the West on a number of issues , notably the Lockerbie bombing and nuclear weapons . Yet tactical changes in foreign policy are not sufficient for the purposes of evaluating political and academic links . There are also ways in which Libyan foreign policy has '' not '' changed : the country continues to call for the destruction of Israel ; Muammar Gaddafi recently called for the abolition of Switzerland , and he receives the leader of the Somali pirates operating off the Horn of Africa as honoured guests of state . Moreover , Libya 's handling of the Lockerbie bombing " has not been characterised by either consistency or clarity , " I have in the past , Halliday noted , defended accepting grants from authoritarian regimes such as the Gulf states , " but there should be clear limits on this , depending on the degree of political and human rights abuses perpetrated with them and on their ongoing foreign policy conduct . " Whitehall and the City are now happy to do business with Libya , but it does not follow that the LSE should do the same . Responsible leaders throughout the Middle East continue to express reservations regarding Libya , including " its more prominent ' liberal ' representatives . " We must remember , Halliday concluded , that the " liberal " wing within a regime such as Libya does not have the function of producing change but its role is instead " to reach compromises with internal hard-liners that serve to lessen external pressure . " A good case in point are the proposals LSE now is considering . It is , as LSE alumni in positions of responsibility in the region caution , " far too early for the School to take this step . " In 2009 , Human Rights Watch was allowed entry to Libya , via Saif al-Islam Gaddafi 's non-profit organization in order to gather facts about the human rights situation there . While HRW reported that there were concerns about the " repressive atmosphere , " they felt there were signs of " improvement " and Sarah Leah Whitson , director of HRW 's Middle East division said that one should not " underestimate the importance of the efforts made so far " by Gaddafi in the realm of human rights in Libya . She also wrote of her official visit that " the real impetus for the transformation rests squarely with a quasi-governmental organization , the Qaddafi Foundation for International Charities and Development " chaired by Gaddafi . She praised Gaddafi for establishing the country 's two semi-private newspapers , and said " it is impossible to underestimate the importance of the efforts made so far . Let 's hope this spring will last . " In January 2011 , HRW criticised other organisations as well as governments that had previously dealt with Gaddafi . HRW Business and Human Rights Director Arvind Ganesan condemned the London School of Economics ( LSE ) for allowing " abusive and corrupt officials or their families to launder their images in exchange for money " . This was later followed by Ganesen saying that " the London School of Economics did not act until Saif al-Islam 's father literally began to kill his own people " . According to NGO Monitor , this was despite the fact that David Held , Co-Director of LSE Global Governance , was partially influenced by Whitson 's remarks regarding her Libyan visit , referring to Saif al-Islam Gaddafi as a reformer

		CONTEXT=At the beginning of 1999 , Wright was kept off WCW television for an extended length of time until May , when Wright came up with his own idea for a gimmick : Promotional spots began appearing on WCW television featuring Wright as a surprising new Rivethead-style character named Berlyn ( an intentional misspelling of the city Berlin , the capital of Wright 's home country Germany ) , with a black Mohawk and goatee replacing his blond hair . He was clad entirely in black with a long trench coat and arrogantly refused to speak English . He spoke through an interpreter — Uta Ludendorff — and was accompanied to the ring by a large wrestler known as The Wall . The promos coincided with the aftermath of the Columbine school massacre , which threw a hitch in WCW 's plans . Sensing the unintentional similarities in dress between Berlyn and the teenage killers , WCW delayed the debut of Berlyn for several months . During his debut on August 30 on '' Nitro '' , he quickly insulted Americans , debuting the character as a heel

		CONTEXT=Loft jazz ( or the loft scene or loft era ) was a cultural phenomenon that occurred in New York City during the mid-1970s . Gary Giddins described it as follows : " [ A ] new coterie of avant - garde musicians took much of the jazz world by surprise ... [ T ] hey interpreted the idea of freedom as the capacity to choose between all the realms of jazz , mixing and matching them not only with each other , but with old and new pop , r & b and rock , classical music and world music ... [ S ] eemingly overnight new venues - in many instances , apartments or lofts ( hence the phrase ' loft jazz ' ) - opened shop to present their wares . " According to Michael Heller , " lofts were not an organization , nor a movement , nor an ideology , nor a genre , nor a neighborhood , nor a lineage of individuals . They were , instead , a meeting point , a locus for interaction . " Heller stated that " loft practices came to be defined by a number of key characteristics , including ( 1 ) low admission charges or suggested donations , ( 2 ) casual atmospheres that blurred the distinction between performer and audience , ( 3 ) ownership / administration by musicians , and ( 4 ) mixed - use spaces that combined both private living areas and public presentation space . " Regarding the music played in these venues , Michael J. Agovino wrote : " This was community music . Part of the point was that , free of the strictures of clubs , the music could be anything , go anywhere , go on for as long as it wanted . " David Such stated that " the cutting contests , personality cults , and vices that characterized the jazz scene of the 1940s and 1950s were mostly missing . " The scene was reviewed and documented by Giddins , Peter Occhiogrosso of the SoHo Weekly News , Leroi Jones , Robert Palmer , and Stanley Crouch .

		CONTEXT=After the commercial lackluster of her eighth studio album , '' Britney Jean '' ( 2013 ) , Spears started her Las Vegas residency show , Britney : Piece of Me , which attained commercial success . Later , in September 2014 , Spears posted a picture of herself in the studio , hinting that she was recording new music . In another interview , a month later , she revealed that she was working " very slowly , but progressively " on the album . In 2015 , she released the song " Pretty Girls " with Iggy Azalea , however the song was met with moderate impact and Spears headed back to the studio to record more songs , but did n't have plans to release a new album . In November 2015 , Spears teased on her Instagram account that she was working with songwriters Justin Tranter and Julia Michaels , by posting a picture of them looking " bemused " with the caption : " Working hard and hardly working ... new album ... wheeeee ! . " A month later , Tranter gave an interview for website NewNowNext about his work with Spears and commented : " Working with Britney is a fucking dream . She is so sweet , so inspiring and a master on the mic . Me and Julia had to leave the studio one day because our screams of excitement after every take she did were distracting the producers . " In late 2016 , during interviews to promote the album , Spears declared that she wanted to explore new things on the record , and that it was her " most hip-hop album , " explaining : " ... there are like two or three songs that go in the direction of more urban that I 've wanted to do for a long time now , and I just have n't really done that . " In May 2016 , in an exclusive interview for website '' Breathe Heavy '' , Tranter revealed : " Nobody ever talks about Britney as a writer and she ’s f " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " was written by Mattias Larsson , Robin Fredriksson , Julia Michaels , Justin Tranter and Sandy Chila , with production being done by Mattman & Robin . Mattman & Robin were also responsible for programming , drums , percussion , snaps , handclaps , synths , guitars , bass and kalimba , while Michaels and Jermaine Jackson provided background vocals . It was recorded at 158 Studios , Westlake Village , California , The Studio at the Palms , Las Vegas , Nevada , and at Wolf Cousins Studios , Stockholm , Sweden . " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is an electropop , and dance-pop song that lasts for three minutes and twenty-two seconds ( 3:22 ) . It features " subtle keyboards , a strummed guitar , " and " wobbly bass " in its instrumentation . For Brian Josephs of '' Spin '' , the song 's guitar slaps " recall her 2001 single ' I 'm a Slave 4 U. ' " Other critics also felt that the " strummed flamenco guitar " on the song is similar to those on Justin Timberlake 's " Like I Love You " . Bianca Gracie of '' Fuse '' opined that the song reminded her of " the glory days ( no pun intended ) of ' Circus ' and ' Femme Fatale ' . " Lyrically , " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is a flirty song about Spears " offer ing several reasons why her lover should come over and options , which can be seen in the lines " Nobody should be alone if they do n't have to be " and " I could get into that kissin ' and touchin ' / Or we could be good and do next to nothin ' . " Amy Roberts of '' Bustle '' noted that the lyrics are about hooking up , adding that they " celebrate the idea that casual relationships do n't need to be lacking respect or understanding . You do n't have to be in love with , or committing to , the person that you 're hooking up with , but that also does n't mean that you ca n't connect with them on a different level than just sex . In fact , Spears makes it clear that it 's kind of even cool if her hook-up does n't want to have sex . Her partner can draw the boundaries of where the massage she 's offering starts and ends , and if it remains as nothing more than a back rub then so be it – that 's totally cool . " For Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine , the song features " some dubious lyrics that seem to suggest masturbatory self-love " in the lines : " All I want is what you want/And all you want is me . " The chorus of the song features " a shouted gang " of backup singers , singing : " Whatever you want / whatever you need / I 'll do it ! . " Lewis Corner of Digital Spy called it " a thumping pop anthem , " praising " Britney 's seductive vocal delivery . " Gil Kaufman of '' Billboard '' named it a " fun , flirty " track . Bianca Gracie of '' Fuse '' described it as a " pulsating track that is a flirty booty call that is bound to own the dance floor . " Robbie Daw of Idolator found it to be " a traditional Spears-style chunk of dance-pop " and " arguably the best yet , with its thick whomping bass and that sparkling ' nobody should be alone if they do n't have to be ' breakdown . " Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine called it " impeccably produced downstairs music , " adding that it " is an irresistible slice of dance-pop , with an ebullient bassline and staccato acoustic guitar . " Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic declared that " some of the highlights on the album are the silliest songs , " citing " Do You Wan na Come Over " 's " overheated flamenco chorus " as an example . Maura Johnston of '' Boston Globe '' said the song was one of the album 's high points , noting that the song " is jolted to life by the slashed guitars that helped make ' Toxic ' a pop thrill . " John Murphy of musicOMH was positive while noting that the track " has a rush and urgency about it which marks it out as one of the album 's best songs . " Nolan Feeney of '' Entertainment Weekly '' also picked it as a highlight , praising the " acoustic guitars and gurgling bass lines that make for one freaky pop experiment . " Alex Macpherson of '' The Guardian '' wrote that the song " takes the party back to Britney 's heyday , " praising the inclusion of the flamenco guitar . For '' Los Angeles Times '' writer Mikael Wood , the song " restore s some of the sonic invention that once defined Spears ' biggest hits . " Nick Levine , writing for '' NME '' , echoed the same thought , writing : " The lusty strut of ‘ Do You Wan na Come Over ? ’ nods to her early-noughties Neptunes-produced hits . " In his Vice column , Robert Christgau selected " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " and " Clumsy " as his favorite tracks on the album . Amy Mackelden of '' Bustle '' elaborated about the track : With a strong '90s vibe , an upbeat tempo , and a surprising rhythm , " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " utilizes the best of Spears ' talents . ... " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " embraces the current trend for songs that are musically complicated , that layer up their beats and sound effects , and feature multiple voices and infectious shouting during their choruses . Much like Hailee Steinfeld and Gwen Stefani 's latest offerings , " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is melodic , has a fast tempo , and is instantly recognizable . And most importantly , it 's fun . On August 18 , 2016 , Spears added " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " , as well as " Make Me ... " , to the setlist of her Las Vegas residency show Britney : Piece of Me . Later , on September 1 , 2016 , a performance of the song was broadcast from Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas for Today . During the performance , she used " an outfit similar to her risqué costume from 2016 's VMAs , while her backup dancers stood out in brightly-colored tank tops and shorts , " as reported by '' Entertainment Weekly '' Ruth Kinane . The song was also included in Spears 's setlist for the iHeartRadio Music Festival on September 24 , 2016 . Spears also performed it at I Heart Radio Jingle Ball , Triple Show and B26 Pepsi Jingle Bash during December 2016 . Also performed it at Apple Music Festival which was held in United Kingdom

In 2015 , she released the song " Pretty Girls " with Iggy Azalea , however the song was met with moderate impact and Spears headed back to the studio to record more songs , but did n't have plans to release a new album . In November 2015 , Spears teased on her Instagram account that she was working with songwriters Justin Tranter and Julia Michaels , by posting a picture of them looking " bemused " with the caption : " Working hard and hardly working ... new album ... wheeeee ! . " A month later , Tranter gave an interview for website NewNowNext about his work with Spears and commented : " Working with Britney is a fucking dream . She is so sweet , so inspiring and a master on the mic . Me and Julia had to leave the studio one day because our screams of excitement after every take she did were distracting the producers . " In late 2016 , during interviews to promote the album , Spears declared that she wanted to explore new things on the record , and that it was her " most hip-hop album , " explaining : " ... there are like two or three songs that go in the direction of more urban that I 've wanted to do for a long time now , and I just have n't really done that . " In May 2016 , in an exclusive interview for website '' Breathe Heavy '' , Tranter revealed : " Nobody ever talks about Britney as a writer and she ’s f " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " was written by Mattias Larsson , Robin Fredriksson , Julia Michaels , Justin Tranter and Sandy Chila , with production being done by Mattman & Robin . Mattman & Robin were also responsible for programming , drums , percussion , snaps , handclaps , synths , guitars , bass and kalimba , while Michaels and Jermaine Jackson provided background vocals . It was recorded at 158 Studios , Westlake Village , California , The Studio at the Palms , Las Vegas , Nevada , and at Wolf Cousins Studios , Stockholm , Sweden . " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is an electropop , and dance-pop song that lasts for three minutes and twenty-two seconds ( 3:22 ) . It features " subtle keyboards , a strummed guitar , " and " wobbly bass " in its instrumentation . For Brian Josephs of '' Spin '' , the song 's guitar slaps " recall her 2001 single ' I 'm a Slave 4 U. ' " Other critics also felt that the " strummed flamenco guitar " on the song is similar to those on Justin Timberlake 's " Like I Love You " . Bianca Gracie of '' Fuse '' opined that the song reminded her of " the glory days ( no pun intended ) of ' Circus ' and ' Femme Fatale ' . " Lyrically , " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is a flirty song about Spears " offer ing several reasons why her lover should come over and options , which can be seen in the lines " Nobody should be alone if they do n't have to be " and " I could get into that kissin ' and touchin ' / Or we could be good and do next to nothin ' . " Amy Roberts of '' Bustle '' noted that the lyrics are about hooking up , adding that they " celebrate the idea that casual relationships do n't need to be lacking respect or understanding . You do n't have to be in love with , or committing to , the person that you 're hooking up with , but that also does n't mean that you ca n't connect with them on a different level than just sex . In fact , Spears makes it clear that it 's kind of even cool if her hook-up does n't want to have sex . Her partner can draw the boundaries of where the massage she 's offering starts and ends , and if it remains as nothing more than a back rub then so be it – that 's totally cool . " For Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine , the song features " some dubious lyrics that seem to suggest masturbatory self-love " in the lines : " All I want is what you want/And all you want is me . " The chorus of the song features " a shouted gang " of backup singers , singing : " Whatever you want / whatever you need / I 'll do it ! . " Lewis Corner of Digital Spy called it " a thumping pop anthem , " praising " Britney 's seductive vocal delivery . " Gil Kaufman of '' Billboard '' named it a " fun , flirty " track . Bianca Gracie of '' Fuse '' described it as a " pulsating track that is a flirty booty call that is bound to own the dance floor . " Robbie Daw of Idolator found it to be " a traditional Spears-style chunk of dance-pop " and " arguably the best yet , with its thick whomping bass and that sparkling ' nobody should be alone if they do n't have to be ' breakdown . " Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine called it " impeccably produced downstairs music , " adding that it " is an irresistible slice of dance-pop , with an ebullient bassline and staccato acoustic guitar . " Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic declared that " some of the highlights on the album are the silliest songs , " citing " Do You Wan na Come Over " 's " overheated flamenco chorus " as an example . Maura Johnston of '' Boston Globe '' said the song was one of the album 's high points , noting that the song " is jolted to life by the slashed guitars that helped make ' Toxic ' a pop thrill . " John Murphy of musicOMH was positive while noting that the track " has a rush and urgency about it which marks it out as one of the album 's best songs . " Nolan Feeney of '' Entertainment Weekly '' also picked it as a highlight , praising the " acoustic guitars and gurgling bass lines that make for one freaky pop experiment . " Alex Macpherson of '' The Guardian '' wrote that the song " takes the party back to Britney 's heyday , " praising the inclusion of the flamenco guitar . For '' Los Angeles Times '' writer Mikael Wood , the song " restore s some of the sonic invention that once defined Spears ' biggest hits . " Nick Levine , writing for '' NME '' , echoed the same thought , writing : " The lusty strut of ‘ Do You Wan na Come Over ? ’ nods to her early-noughties Neptunes-produced hits . " In his Vice column , Robert Christgau selected " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " and " Clumsy " as his favorite tracks on the album . Amy Mackelden of '' Bustle '' elaborated about the track : With a strong '90s vibe , an upbeat tempo , and a surprising rhythm , " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " utilizes the best of Spears ' talents . ... " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " embraces the current trend for songs that are musically complicated , that layer up their beats and sound effects , and feature multiple voices and infectious shouting during their choruses . Much like Hailee Steinfeld and Gwen Stefani 's latest offerings , " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is melodic , has a fast tempo , and is instantly recognizable . And most importantly , it 's fun . On August 18 , 2016 , Spears added " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " , as well as " Make Me ... " , to the setlist of her Las Vegas residency show Britney : Piece of Me . Later , on September 1 , 2016 , a performance of the song was broadcast from Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas for Today . During the performance , she used " an outfit similar to her risqué costume from 2016 's VMAs , while her backup dancers stood out in brightly-colored tank tops and shorts , " as reported by '' Entertainment Weekly '' Ruth Kinane . The song was also included in Spears 's setlist for the iHeartRadio Music Festival on September 24 , 2016 . Spears also performed it at I Heart Radio Jingle Ball , Triple Show and B26 Pepsi Jingle Bash during December 2016 . Also performed it at Apple Music Festival which was held in United Kingdom

" A staff writer for the '' Chicago Defender '' lauded his performance at the Chicago Theatre , calling it " an explosive mixture of R&B , soul and funk . " '' Rolling Stone '' called him " abundantly gifted , eye-poppingly spectacular " , " confident and worldly " in his performance at the House of Blues in Los Angeles . It compared the performance to his past concerts , stating " he 's alive onstage now , dancing , touching the audience , slamming his microphone down , lying on the ground at the lip of the stage to sing ' One Mo ' Gin ' while girls grab his legs , his stomach , his crotch .

Everything meshed ; all stops were pulled out .

I flashed on P-Funk 's ' Sadie ' , Apollo 1981 . What a privilege to experience such a thing again . " He also compared it to Marvin Gaye in concert , writing that " I saw Marvin Gaye at this venue shortly before he was murdered , and it was no contest . Gaye was fine , but self-indulgent and riddled with blank spots . "

		CONTEXT=Charles Edward was imprisoned until 1946 . He was originally charged with Crimes against humanity and the trial was held . Though he was exonerated of complicity in actual war crimes , he was judged to have been " an important Nazi " . Only his failing health saved him from remaining in prison . Another factor for leniency towards him was the fact that in April 1946 , his daughter Sybilla had given birth to a son , the future King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden , who became , upon birth , third-in-line to the Swedish throne . In January 1947 , Sybilla 's husband died in a plane crash , and in October 1950 , King Gustaf V of Sweden died , at which point Charles Edward 's grandson became the Crown Prince of Sweden . In that same year 1950 ( or August 1949 , according to his ODNB entry ) , after several appeals , Charles Edward was sentenced by a denazification court as a '' Mitläufer '' and '' Minderbelasteter '' ( roughly : follower and of lesser guilt ) , fined ( DM 5,000 ) and almost bankrupted . Had he been convicted for the greater charge of " crimes against humanity , " he would have been liable for a death sentence , and even otherwise , to criminalize the future king 's grandfather for " crimes against humanity " would lead to major embarrassment in the immediate term and could have ramifications in years to come . The lesser sentence was therefore handed out

" Kitty Empire of '' NME '' commented on how Mystikal is able to deviate from the typical hip-hop clichés and deliver tracks that express different topics , singling out the post-9 / 11 track " Bouncin ' Back ( Bumpin ' Me Against the Wall ) " for providing real substance and found it " strangely compelling for a show of strength .

" was written by Mattias Larsson , Robin Fredriksson , Julia Michaels , Justin Tranter and Sandy Chila , with production being done by Mattman & Robin . Mattman & Robin were also responsible for programming , drums , percussion , snaps , handclaps , synths , guitars , bass and kalimba , while Michaels and Jermaine Jackson provided background vocals . It was recorded at 158 Studios , Westlake Village , California , The Studio at the Palms , Las Vegas , Nevada , and at Wolf Cousins Studios , Stockholm , Sweden . " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is an electropop , and dance-pop song that lasts for three minutes and twenty-two seconds ( 3:22 ) . It features " subtle keyboards , a strummed guitar , " and " wobbly bass " in its instrumentation . For Brian Josephs of '' Spin '' , the song 's guitar slaps " recall her 2001 single ' I 'm a Slave 4 U. ' " Other critics also felt that the " strummed flamenco guitar " on the song is similar to those on Justin Timberlake 's " Like I Love You " . Bianca Gracie of '' Fuse '' opined that the song reminded her of " the glory days ( no pun intended ) of ' Circus ' and ' Femme Fatale ' . " Lyrically , " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is a flirty song about Spears " offer ing several reasons why her lover should come over and options , which can be seen in the lines " Nobody should be alone if they do n't have to be " and " I could get into that kissin ' and touchin ' / Or we could be good and do next to nothin ' . " Amy Roberts of '' Bustle '' noted that the lyrics are about hooking up , adding that they " celebrate the idea that casual relationships do n't need to be lacking respect or understanding . You do n't have to be in love with , or committing to , the person that you 're hooking up with , but that also does n't mean that you ca n't connect with them on a different level than just sex . In fact , Spears makes it clear that it 's kind of even cool if her hook-up does n't want to have sex . Her partner can draw the boundaries of where the massage she 's offering starts and ends , and if it remains as nothing more than a back rub then so be it – that 's totally cool . " For Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine , the song features " some dubious lyrics that seem to suggest masturbatory self-love " in the lines : " All I want is what you want/And all you want is me . " The chorus of the song features " a shouted gang " of backup singers , singing : " Whatever you want / whatever you need / I 'll do it ! . " Lewis Corner of Digital Spy called it " a thumping pop anthem , " praising " Britney 's seductive vocal delivery . " Gil Kaufman of '' Billboard '' named it a " fun , flirty " track . Bianca Gracie of '' Fuse '' described it as a " pulsating track that is a flirty booty call that is bound to own the dance floor . " Robbie Daw of Idolator found it to be " a traditional Spears-style chunk of dance-pop " and " arguably the best yet , with its thick whomping bass and that sparkling ' nobody should be alone if they do n't have to be ' breakdown . " Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine called it " impeccably produced downstairs music , " adding that it " is an irresistible slice of dance-pop , with an ebullient bassline and staccato acoustic guitar . " Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic declared that " some of the highlights on the album are the silliest songs , " citing " Do You Wan na Come Over " 's " overheated flamenco chorus " as an example . Maura Johnston of '' Boston Globe '' said the song was one of the album 's high points , noting that the song " is jolted to life by the slashed guitars that helped make ' Toxic ' a pop thrill . " John Murphy of musicOMH was positive while noting that the track " has a rush and urgency about it which marks it out as one of the album 's best songs . " Nolan Feeney of '' Entertainment Weekly '' also picked it as a highlight , praising the " acoustic guitars and gurgling bass lines that make for one freaky pop experiment . " Alex Macpherson of '' The Guardian '' wrote that the song " takes the party back to Britney 's heyday , " praising the inclusion of the flamenco guitar . For '' Los Angeles Times '' writer Mikael Wood , the song " restore s some of the sonic invention that once defined Spears ' biggest hits . " Nick Levine , writing for '' NME '' , echoed the same thought , writing : " The lusty strut of ‘ Do You Wan na Come Over ? ’ nods to her early-noughties Neptunes-produced hits . " In his Vice column , Robert Christgau selected " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " and " Clumsy " as his favorite tracks on the album . Amy Mackelden of '' Bustle '' elaborated about the track : With a strong '90s vibe , an upbeat tempo , and a surprising rhythm , " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " utilizes the best of Spears ' talents . ... " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " embraces the current trend for songs that are musically complicated , that layer up their beats and sound effects , and feature multiple voices and infectious shouting during their choruses . Much like Hailee Steinfeld and Gwen Stefani 's latest offerings , " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is melodic , has a fast tempo , and is instantly recognizable . And most importantly , it 's fun . On August 18 , 2016 , Spears added " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " , as well as " Make Me ... " , to the setlist of her Las Vegas residency show Britney : Piece of Me . Later , on September 1 , 2016 , a performance of the song was broadcast from Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas for Today . During the performance , she used " an outfit similar to her risqué costume from 2016 's VMAs , while her backup dancers stood out in brightly-colored tank tops and shorts , " as reported by '' Entertainment Weekly '' Ruth Kinane . The song was also included in Spears 's setlist for the iHeartRadio Music Festival on September 24 , 2016 . Spears also performed it at I Heart Radio Jingle Ball , Triple Show and B26 Pepsi Jingle Bash during December 2016 . Also performed it at Apple Music Festival which was held in United Kingdom

		CONTEXT=Ray Brown & the Whispers were a highly successful Australian rock band from 1964 to 1967 . Led by singer Ray Brown , they ranked alongside the Easybeats , Billy Thorpe & the Aztecs and Normie Rowe as one of the most popular acts of the period . In 1964 , the band played at the Bowl , a Sydney nightclub , doing covers of popular songs such as " Shakin All Over " . The group performed regularly in front of thousands of excitable teenagers who danced wildly to the sounds and energy provided by these new pop heroes . It was inevitable that the clean - cut and personable Brown would stand as the equal of Normie and Stevie Wright as a pin - up sensation . Over a frantic period of two years , Brown and the Whispers issued four excellent albums , seven hits singles and eight EPs . Indeed , their remarkable run of four Top 5 hits in a row – including three # 1s in " 20 Miles " , " Pride " and " Fool , Fool , Fool " - in hometown Sydney during 1965 alone proved to be a milestone in local pop music history . Other highlights include the gritty garage rockers " ( Ai n't It ) Strange " and " That 's Evil " , the moody " Too Late to Come Home " ( with the Bee Gees on backing vocals ) , the chiming " Go to Him " , laden with electric 12 - sting guitar , and tremendous covers of soul staples " In the Midnight Hour " and " Respect " .

It was also the first season head coach Terry Porter had been able to use the summer to implement his defensive approach for a team which had in seasons past scored a large number of their points off fast breaks and early in the shot clock .

		CONTEXT=After the commercial lackluster of her eighth studio album , '' Britney Jean '' ( 2013 ) , Spears started her Las Vegas residency show , Britney : Piece of Me , which attained commercial success . Later , in September 2014 , Spears posted a picture of herself in the studio , hinting that she was recording new music . In another interview , a month later , she revealed that she was working " very slowly , but progressively " on the album . In 2015 , she released the song " Pretty Girls " with Iggy Azalea , however the song was met with moderate impact and Spears headed back to the studio to record more songs , but did n't have plans to release a new album . In November 2015 , Spears teased on her Instagram account that she was working with songwriters Justin Tranter and Julia Michaels , by posting a picture of them looking " bemused " with the caption : " Working hard and hardly working ... new album ... wheeeee ! . " A month later , Tranter gave an interview for website NewNowNext about his work with Spears and commented : " Working with Britney is a fucking dream . She is so sweet , so inspiring and a master on the mic . Me and Julia had to leave the studio one day because our screams of excitement after every take she did were distracting the producers . " In late 2016 , during interviews to promote the album , Spears declared that she wanted to explore new things on the record , and that it was her " most hip-hop album , " explaining : " ... there are like two or three songs that go in the direction of more urban that I 've wanted to do for a long time now , and I just have n't really done that . " In May 2016 , in an exclusive interview for website '' Breathe Heavy '' , Tranter revealed : " Nobody ever talks about Britney as a writer and she ’s f " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " was written by Mattias Larsson , Robin Fredriksson , Julia Michaels , Justin Tranter and Sandy Chila , with production being done by Mattman & Robin . Mattman & Robin were also responsible for programming , drums , percussion , snaps , handclaps , synths , guitars , bass and kalimba , while Michaels and Jermaine Jackson provided background vocals . It was recorded at 158 Studios , Westlake Village , California , The Studio at the Palms , Las Vegas , Nevada , and at Wolf Cousins Studios , Stockholm , Sweden . " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is an electropop , and dance-pop song that lasts for three minutes and twenty-two seconds ( 3:22 ) . It features " subtle keyboards , a strummed guitar , " and " wobbly bass " in its instrumentation . For Brian Josephs of '' Spin '' , the song 's guitar slaps " recall her 2001 single ' I 'm a Slave 4 U. ' " Other critics also felt that the " strummed flamenco guitar " on the song is similar to those on Justin Timberlake 's " Like I Love You " . Bianca Gracie of '' Fuse '' opined that the song reminded her of " the glory days ( no pun intended ) of ' Circus ' and ' Femme Fatale ' . " Lyrically , " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is a flirty song about Spears " offer ing several reasons why her lover should come over and options , which can be seen in the lines " Nobody should be alone if they do n't have to be " and " I could get into that kissin ' and touchin ' / Or we could be good and do next to nothin ' . " Amy Roberts of '' Bustle '' noted that the lyrics are about hooking up , adding that they " celebrate the idea that casual relationships do n't need to be lacking respect or understanding . You do n't have to be in love with , or committing to , the person that you 're hooking up with , but that also does n't mean that you ca n't connect with them on a different level than just sex . In fact , Spears makes it clear that it 's kind of even cool if her hook-up does n't want to have sex . Her partner can draw the boundaries of where the massage she 's offering starts and ends , and if it remains as nothing more than a back rub then so be it – that 's totally cool . " For Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine , the song features " some dubious lyrics that seem to suggest masturbatory self-love " in the lines : " All I want is what you want/And all you want is me . " The chorus of the song features " a shouted gang " of backup singers , singing : " Whatever you want / whatever you need / I 'll do it ! . " Lewis Corner of Digital Spy called it " a thumping pop anthem , " praising " Britney 's seductive vocal delivery . " Gil Kaufman of '' Billboard '' named it a " fun , flirty " track . Bianca Gracie of '' Fuse '' described it as a " pulsating track that is a flirty booty call that is bound to own the dance floor . " Robbie Daw of Idolator found it to be " a traditional Spears-style chunk of dance-pop " and " arguably the best yet , with its thick whomping bass and that sparkling ' nobody should be alone if they do n't have to be ' breakdown . " Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine called it " impeccably produced downstairs music , " adding that it " is an irresistible slice of dance-pop , with an ebullient bassline and staccato acoustic guitar . " Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic declared that " some of the highlights on the album are the silliest songs , " citing " Do You Wan na Come Over " 's " overheated flamenco chorus " as an example . Maura Johnston of '' Boston Globe '' said the song was one of the album 's high points , noting that the song " is jolted to life by the slashed guitars that helped make ' Toxic ' a pop thrill . " John Murphy of musicOMH was positive while noting that the track " has a rush and urgency about it which marks it out as one of the album 's best songs . " Nolan Feeney of '' Entertainment Weekly '' also picked it as a highlight , praising the " acoustic guitars and gurgling bass lines that make for one freaky pop experiment . " Alex Macpherson of '' The Guardian '' wrote that the song " takes the party back to Britney 's heyday , " praising the inclusion of the flamenco guitar . For '' Los Angeles Times '' writer Mikael Wood , the song " restore s some of the sonic invention that once defined Spears ' biggest hits .

" In his Vice column , Robert Christgau selected " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " and " Clumsy " as his favorite tracks on the album .

She stated , " I had a song in mind , and I need a woman with a big voice to sing the chorus because I ca n't do it " . Azalea then asked Perry if she could record " Black Widow " for her album , which Perry then agreed to . The record , however , was never sent to Azalea and on 1 August 2013 , she denied that Ora would be collaborating with her on the album . Azalea then met Perry for the first time , as her supporting act at the iTunes Festival that year .

		CONTEXT=The album received mixed reviews from music critics . According to review aggregator Metacritic , the album has a score of 48/100 based on 8 reviews , indicating " mixed or average reviews " . On another aggregator website , Album of the Year , it holds the 4th position on a list of worst reviewed albums of 2014 . Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic gave the album 2.5 stars out of 5 saying that " Michele is not a natural pop star . This was true in 2009 when she debuted on '' Glee '' as Rachel Berry and it 's even clearer in 2014 . " Mike Ayers from '' Billboard '' gave a mostly positive review , saying , " Lyrically , '' Louder '' is rather one-sided , as she often sings about the perils of relationships , over and over , in ways that we 've all heard many times at this point . Still , it 's a solid effort that shows she has promise as a bonafide pop artist . " Sarah Rodman of '' The Boston Globe '' gave the album a mostly positive review , writing , " The Broadway veteran puts her mighty soprano through its paces on bouncy dance tracks , soaring ballads , and midtempo pop tunes where she straddles the line , mostly comfortably , between Katy Perry and Celine Dion . " Kyle Anderson of '' Entertainment Weekly '' gave the album a B - , writing , " It 's hard to be that mad at '' Louder '' , because it 's so admirably and lovingly crafted . There 's nothing wrong with Lea Michele 's debut , and that 's its biggest problem . While well curated and exquisitely executed , '' Louder '' is missing the visceral oomph that defines the gulf between superstars and the rest of the top 40 chum . " At '' USA Today '' , Jerry Shriver rated the album 2.5 stars out of four , and stated that " softer would have been a better approach . " He added that the song " Battlefield " points to a more promising direction . Kevin McFarland of '' The A.V. Club '' gave a C - rating , writing , " '' Louder '' , Michele 's debut solo album under her own name , does feature her distinctive talent as a vocalist . But the record is caught in an unfortunate stylistic limbo between fun-loving , youthful pop and the maturity of adult contemporary artists . " Jim Farber of the '' New York Daily News '' awarded the album two stars . He criticized , " Michele does n't so much sing as trumpet like an elephant eager for the charge . Her voice has more need than vulnerability , more anger than understanding . " Christopher R. Weingarten of '' Rolling Stone '' also gave a negative review , stating , " This album of insta-dated EDM-pop anthems and half-cocked bass drops probably wo n't help Michele 's cause . The songs about love 's ups and downs have a few memorable lyrics ( ' My heart 's too drunk to drive ' ) but not nearly enough . " '' Louder '' was nominated for World 's Best Album at the 2014 World Music Awards , held in Monaco on May 27 , 2014

In November 2015 , Spears teased on her Instagram account that she was working with songwriters Justin Tranter and Julia Michaels , by posting a picture of them looking " bemused " with the caption : " Working hard and hardly working ... new album ... wheeeee ! .

" In late 2016 , during interviews to promote the album , Spears declared that she wanted to explore new things on the record , and that it was her " most hip-hop album , " explaining : " ... there are like two or three songs that go in the direction of more urban that I 've wanted to do for a long time now , and I just have n't really done that .

		GOLD_MENTION=2019 Awards
		CONTEXT=During a ceremony , sometimes a celebrity presenter or award winner might not know when they are going to be slimed onstage or offstage , though as the years went on , getting slimed became more of an honor , and less of the comedic humiliation of where the concept originated , with the early Nickelodeon series '' You Ca n't Do That on Television '' . Hosts of the show have also been slimed , especially in recent years , and occasionally celebrities not attending the awards have been slimed via video segment , such as when Rosie O'Donnell tricked Melissa Joan Hart into getting slimed on the set of '' Sabrina the Teenage Witch '' in 2001 , or when Amanda Seyfried and Josh Hutcherson were slimed at a KCA watch party in 2013 . Celebrities sitting in the audience are also fair game for being slimed , as Mandy Moore first learned in 2007 , and Halle Berry later found out in 2012 . Although Les Lye was the only celebrity to be slimed at the 1988 Awards , a video was shown during the show of then Nickelodeon president Geraldine Laybourne saying the magic words and getting slimed with the original '' YCDTOTV '' recipe , much to her dismay , proving that not even the network president was safe from the slime . Last but not least , in addition to the celebrity slimings in 1992 , the entire audience was slimed at the end of the show , which began a long running tradition known as '' The Final Slime '' , which is still in effect as of the 2019 Awards

Fox decided to repeat " To Cur with Love " in the regular timeslot one week later replacing a repeat , while also putting the pre-empted episode of '' Family Guy '' and a new episode of '' American Dad ! '' entitled " National Treasure 4 : Baby Franny : She 's Doing Well : The Hole Story " , unrelated to " Minstrel Krampus " , on the air .

		GOLD_MENTION=VMAs
		CONTEXT=After the commercial lackluster of her eighth studio album , '' Britney Jean '' ( 2013 ) , Spears started her Las Vegas residency show , Britney : Piece of Me , which attained commercial success . Later , in September 2014 , Spears posted a picture of herself in the studio , hinting that she was recording new music . In another interview , a month later , she revealed that she was working " very slowly , but progressively " on the album . In 2015 , she released the song " Pretty Girls " with Iggy Azalea , however the song was met with moderate impact and Spears headed back to the studio to record more songs , but did n't have plans to release a new album . In November 2015 , Spears teased on her Instagram account that she was working with songwriters Justin Tranter and Julia Michaels , by posting a picture of them looking " bemused " with the caption : " Working hard and hardly working ... new album ... wheeeee ! . " A month later , Tranter gave an interview for website NewNowNext about his work with Spears and commented : " Working with Britney is a fucking dream . She is so sweet , so inspiring and a master on the mic . Me and Julia had to leave the studio one day because our screams of excitement after every take she did were distracting the producers . " In late 2016 , during interviews to promote the album , Spears declared that she wanted to explore new things on the record , and that it was her " most hip-hop album , " explaining : " ... there are like two or three songs that go in the direction of more urban that I 've wanted to do for a long time now , and I just have n't really done that . " In May 2016 , in an exclusive interview for website '' Breathe Heavy '' , Tranter revealed : " Nobody ever talks about Britney as a writer and she ’s f " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " was written by Mattias Larsson , Robin Fredriksson , Julia Michaels , Justin Tranter and Sandy Chila , with production being done by Mattman & Robin . Mattman & Robin were also responsible for programming , drums , percussion , snaps , handclaps , synths , guitars , bass and kalimba , while Michaels and Jermaine Jackson provided background vocals . It was recorded at 158 Studios , Westlake Village , California , The Studio at the Palms , Las Vegas , Nevada , and at Wolf Cousins Studios , Stockholm , Sweden . " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is an electropop , and dance-pop song that lasts for three minutes and twenty-two seconds ( 3:22 ) . It features " subtle keyboards , a strummed guitar , " and " wobbly bass " in its instrumentation . For Brian Josephs of '' Spin '' , the song 's guitar slaps " recall her 2001 single ' I 'm a Slave 4 U. ' " Other critics also felt that the " strummed flamenco guitar " on the song is similar to those on Justin Timberlake 's " Like I Love You " . Bianca Gracie of '' Fuse '' opined that the song reminded her of " the glory days ( no pun intended ) of ' Circus ' and ' Femme Fatale ' . " Lyrically , " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is a flirty song about Spears " offer ing several reasons why her lover should come over and options , which can be seen in the lines " Nobody should be alone if they do n't have to be " and " I could get into that kissin ' and touchin ' / Or we could be good and do next to nothin ' . " Amy Roberts of '' Bustle '' noted that the lyrics are about hooking up , adding that they " celebrate the idea that casual relationships do n't need to be lacking respect or understanding . You do n't have to be in love with , or committing to , the person that you 're hooking up with , but that also does n't mean that you ca n't connect with them on a different level than just sex . In fact , Spears makes it clear that it 's kind of even cool if her hook-up does n't want to have sex . Her partner can draw the boundaries of where the massage she 's offering starts and ends , and if it remains as nothing more than a back rub then so be it – that 's totally cool . " For Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine , the song features " some dubious lyrics that seem to suggest masturbatory self-love " in the lines : " All I want is what you want/And all you want is me . " The chorus of the song features " a shouted gang " of backup singers , singing : " Whatever you want / whatever you need / I 'll do it ! . " Lewis Corner of Digital Spy called it " a thumping pop anthem , " praising " Britney 's seductive vocal delivery . " Gil Kaufman of '' Billboard '' named it a " fun , flirty " track . Bianca Gracie of '' Fuse '' described it as a " pulsating track that is a flirty booty call that is bound to own the dance floor . " Robbie Daw of Idolator found it to be " a traditional Spears-style chunk of dance-pop " and " arguably the best yet , with its thick whomping bass and that sparkling ' nobody should be alone if they do n't have to be ' breakdown . " Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine called it " impeccably produced downstairs music , " adding that it " is an irresistible slice of dance-pop , with an ebullient bassline and staccato acoustic guitar . " Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic declared that " some of the highlights on the album are the silliest songs , " citing " Do You Wan na Come Over " 's " overheated flamenco chorus " as an example . Maura Johnston of '' Boston Globe '' said the song was one of the album 's high points , noting that the song " is jolted to life by the slashed guitars that helped make ' Toxic ' a pop thrill . " John Murphy of musicOMH was positive while noting that the track " has a rush and urgency about it which marks it out as one of the album 's best songs . " Nolan Feeney of '' Entertainment Weekly '' also picked it as a highlight , praising the " acoustic guitars and gurgling bass lines that make for one freaky pop experiment . " Alex Macpherson of '' The Guardian '' wrote that the song " takes the party back to Britney 's heyday , " praising the inclusion of the flamenco guitar . For '' Los Angeles Times '' writer Mikael Wood , the song " restore s some of the sonic invention that once defined Spears ' biggest hits . " Nick Levine , writing for '' NME '' , echoed the same thought , writing : " The lusty strut of ‘ Do You Wan na Come Over ? ’ nods to her early-noughties Neptunes-produced hits . " In his Vice column , Robert Christgau selected " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " and " Clumsy " as his favorite tracks on the album . Amy Mackelden of '' Bustle '' elaborated about the track : With a strong '90s vibe , an upbeat tempo , and a surprising rhythm , " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " utilizes the best of Spears ' talents . ... " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " embraces the current trend for songs that are musically complicated , that layer up their beats and sound effects , and feature multiple voices and infectious shouting during their choruses . Much like Hailee Steinfeld and Gwen Stefani 's latest offerings , " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is melodic , has a fast tempo , and is instantly recognizable . And most importantly , it 's fun . On August 18 , 2016 , Spears added " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " , as well as " Make Me ... " , to the setlist of her Las Vegas residency show Britney : Piece of Me . Later , on September 1 , 2016 , a performance of the song was broadcast from Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas for Today . During the performance , she used " an outfit similar to her risqué costume from 2016 's VMAs , while her backup dancers stood out in brightly-colored tank tops and shorts , " as reported by '' Entertainment Weekly '' Ruth Kinane . The song was also included in Spears 's setlist for the iHeartRadio Music Festival on September 24 , 2016 . Spears also performed it at I Heart Radio Jingle Ball , Triple Show and B26 Pepsi Jingle Bash during December 2016 . Also performed it at Apple Music Festival which was held in United Kingdom

Club '' awarded the episode an " A " , calling it " a fascinating psychological horror story about a boy shedding everything that defines him in order to move on to the next phase of his life . " Sava noted that while the episode was humorous , much of the comedy was undercut by the tragic and distressing nature of Finn 's story . Andrew Tran of Overmental argued that " the episode ... dissects vividly that bottomless feeling of midlife wanderlust ... not the road-trippy , running-through-the-fields kind but rather the life-map-disappearing-in-your-hands , what-the-hell-is-next kind . " Tran contended that , through the use of video game tropes , explores the idea that life is ultimately unpredictable that there " is no map that you can make for yourself ( or that anyone can give you ) that can account for everything you ’re going to encounter " . " The Hall of Egress " has been highly lauded by the show 's production staff , with series creator Pendleton Ward in particular naming it as one of his favorites . According to the crew , " It was just so thoughtfully done . " At the 68th Primetime Emmy Awards in 2016 , " The Hall of Egress " was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Short-format Animation .

		GOLD_MENTION=Stalinist terror
		CONTEXT=The crux of Nolte 's thesis was presented when he wrote : " It is a notable shortcoming of the literature about National Socialism that it does not know or does not want to admit to what degree all the deeds — with the sole exception of the technical process of gassing — that the National Socialists later committed had already been described in a voluminous literature of the early 1920s : mass deportations and shootings , torture , death camps , extermination of entire groups using strictly objective selection criteria , and public demands for the annihilation of millions of guiltless people who were thought to be " enemies " . It is probable that many of these reports were exaggerated . It is certain that the “ White Terror ” also committed terrible deeds , even though its program contained no analogy to the “ extermination of the bourgeoisie ” . Nonetheless , the following question must seem permissible , even unavoidable : Did the National Socialists or Hitler perhaps commit an “ Asiatic ” deed merely because they and their ilk considered themselves to be the potential victims of an “ Asiatic ” deed ? Was n’t the ' Gulag Archipelago ' more original than Auschwitz ? Was the Bolshevik murder of an entire class not the logical and factual '' prius '' of the " racial murder " of National Socialism ? Can not Hitler 's most secret deeds be explained by the fact that he had '' not '' forgotten the rat cage ? Did Auschwitz in its root causes not originate in a past that would not pass ? " Nolte wrote the principle problem " for the coming generations ... must be liberation from collectivist thinking " , which Nolte claimed dominated scholarship on Nazi Germany . Nolte ended his essay with calling for a " more comprehensive debate " about the memory of Nazi Germany that would allow for " the past that will not go away " to finally go away " as is suitable for every past " . Nolte subsequently presented a 1940 book by American author Theodore N. Kaufman entitled '' Germany Must Perish ! '' . The text contends that all German men should be sterilized , evidencing , according to Nolte , the alleged " Jewish " desire to " annihilate " Germans prior to the Holocaust . An August 1941 appeal to the world by a group of Soviet Jews seeking support against Germany was also cited by Nolte as evidence of Jewish determination to thwart the '' Reich '' . Nolte argued that the Nazis felt forced to undertake the Holocaust by Hitler 's conclusion that the entire Jewish population of the world had declared war on Germany . From Nolte 's point of view , the Holocaust was an act of “ Asiatic barbarism ” forced on the Germans by the fear of what Joseph Stalin , whom Nolte believed to have significant Jewish support , might do to them . Nolte contends that the U.S. internment of Japanese Americans in the wake of the Pearl Harbor attack provides a parallel to the German " internment " of the Jewish population of Europe in concentration camps , in light of what Nolte alleges was the " Jewish " declaration of war on Germany in 1939 which Weizmann 's letter allegedly constitutes . Subsequently , Nolte expanded upon these views in his 1987 book '' Der europäische Bürgerkrieg , 1917 – 1945 '' ( '' The European Civil War , 1917 – 1945 '' ) in which he claimed that the entire 20th century was an age of genocide , totalitarianism , and tyranny , and that the Holocaust had been merely one chapter in the age of violence , terror and population displacement . Nolte claimed that this age had started with the genocide of the Armenians during World War I , and also included the Stalinist terror in the Soviet Union , the expulsion of ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe , Maoist terror in China as manifested in such events as the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution , compulsory population exchanges between Greece and Turkey from 1922 to 1923 , American war crimes in the Vietnam War , the Khmer Rouge genocide in Cambodia , and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan . In particular , Nolte argued that the expulsion of ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe in 1945 – 46 was " to be categorized ... under the concept of genocide " . As part of this argument , Nolte cited the 1979 book of the American historian Alfred-Maurice de Zayas , '' Die Wehrmacht Untersuchungsstelle '' , which argues that the Allies were just as guilty of war crimes as the Germans as the " happy evidence of the will to objectivity on the part of a foreigner " In Nolte 's opinion , Hitler was a " European citizen " who fought in defence of the values of the West against " Asiatic " Bolshevism , but due to his " total egocentrism " waged this struggle with unnecessary violence and brutality Since in Nolte 's view , the '' Shoah '' was not a unique crime , there is no reason to single out Germans for special criticism for the Holocaust . In addition , Nolte sees his work as the beginning of a much-needed revisionist treatment to end the " negative myth " of the Third Reich that dominates contemporary perceptions . Nolte took the view that the principle problem of German history was this “ negative myth ” of the Third Reich , which cast the Nazi era as the '' ne plus ultra '' of evil . Nolte wrote that after the American Civil War , the defeated South was cast as the symbol of total evil by the victorious North , but later “ revisionism ” became the dominant historical interpretation against the “ negative myth ” of the South , which led to a more balanced history of the Civil War with a greater understanding of the “ motives and way of life of the defeated Southern states ” , and led to the leaders of the Confederacy becoming great American heroes . Nolte urged that a similar “ revisionism ” destroy the “ negative myth ” of the Third Reich . Nolte argued that the Vietnam War , the Khmer Rouge genocide , the expulsion of " boat people " from Vietnam , the Islamic revolution in Iran , and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan meant the traditional picture of Nazi Germany as the ultimate in evil was no longer tenable , and proved the need for " revisionism " to put an end to the " negative myth " of the Third Reich . In Nolte 's view , the first efforts at revisionism of the Nazi period failed because A. J. P. Taylor 's 1961 book '' The Origins of the Second World War '' was only a part of the " anti-German literature of indictment " while David Hoggan in '' Der erzwugnene Krieg '' , by only seeking to examine why World War II broke out in 1939 , " cut himself off from the really decisive questions " . Then the next revisionist efforts Nolte cites were the Italian historian Domenico Settembrini 's favorable treatment of Fascism for saving Italy from Communism , and the British historian Timothy Mason 's studies in working class German history . The best of the revisionists according to Nolte is David Irving , with whom Nolte finds some fault , although " not all of Irving 's theses and points can be dismissed with such ease " . Nolte praises Irving as the first to understand that Weizmann 's letter to Chamberlain was a " Jewish declaration of war " on Germany that justified the " interning " of the Jews of Europe . Nolte went on to praise Irving for putting the Holocaust " in a more comprehensive perspective " by comparing it to the British fire-bombing of Hamburg in 1943 , which Nolte views as just much of an act of genocide as the " Final Solution " . The sort of revisionism needed to end the " negative myth " of the Third Reich is , in Nolte 's opinion , an examination of the impact of the Russian Revolution on Germany

The outbreak produced the largest 24 - hour total of killer tornadoes until the 1974 Super Outbreak on April 3 – 4 . The precise number of tornadoes as well as fatalities incurred during the outbreak is unknown , but the death toll was variously estimated to range from 370 – 2,000 at the time . A reliable survey by the Signal Corps in 1889 located 182 fatalities , and a reanalysis by tornado researcher Thomas P. Grazulis in 1993 counted 178 deaths . Nonetheless , an inspection of newspaper reports and governmental studies published in the aftermath reveals successive , long - tracked tornado families striking Alabama , Georgia , Illinois , Indiana , Kentucky , Mississippi , North Carolina , South Carolina , Tennessee and Virginia , with an estimation of at least 37 tornadoes .

		CONTEXT=On March 27 , 2017 , Archie Miller was named the 29th head coach in the history of the men 's basketball program . Miller 's first season was a major remodeling job , starting with laying the foundation of a pack-line defense and valuing possessions . Early in the season , Miller stated practices were 75 % defense , 25 % offense . That scheme showed early and often , as the Hoosiers struggled mightily throughout the season to find any flow or rhythm on offense , despite the defense making leaps and bounds in the overall rankings of Division 1 basketball . With a surprising early second round loss in the 2018 Big Ten Tournament to Rutgers , 67 – 76 , and losing enough games to keep them out of both the NCAA tournament and NIT , including games in which they were favored , such as Indiana State and Fort Wayne , IU 's first season under their new coach came to a disappointing close .

		ANSWER=elle
		GOLD_MENTION=Stalinist terror
		CONTEXT=The crux of Nolte 's thesis was presented when he wrote : " It is a notable shortcoming of the literature about National Socialism that it does not know or does not want to admit to what degree all the deeds — with the sole exception of the technical process of gassing — that the National Socialists later committed had already been described in a voluminous literature of the early 1920s : mass deportations and shootings , torture , death camps , extermination of entire groups using strictly objective selection criteria , and public demands for the annihilation of millions of guiltless people who were thought to be " enemies " . It is probable that many of these reports were exaggerated . It is certain that the “ White Terror ” also committed terrible deeds , even though its program contained no analogy to the “ extermination of the bourgeoisie ” . Nonetheless , the following question must seem permissible , even unavoidable : Did the National Socialists or Hitler perhaps commit an “ Asiatic ” deed merely because they and their ilk considered themselves to be the potential victims of an “ Asiatic ” deed ? Was n’t the ' Gulag Archipelago ' more original than Auschwitz ? Was the Bolshevik murder of an entire class not the logical and factual '' prius '' of the " racial murder " of National Socialism ? Can not Hitler 's most secret deeds be explained by the fact that he had '' not '' forgotten the rat cage ? Did Auschwitz in its root causes not originate in a past that would not pass ? " Nolte wrote the principle problem " for the coming generations ... must be liberation from collectivist thinking " , which Nolte claimed dominated scholarship on Nazi Germany . Nolte ended his essay with calling for a " more comprehensive debate " about the memory of Nazi Germany that would allow for " the past that will not go away " to finally go away " as is suitable for every past " . Nolte subsequently presented a 1940 book by American author Theodore N. Kaufman entitled '' Germany Must Perish ! '' . The text contends that all German men should be sterilized , evidencing , according to Nolte , the alleged " Jewish " desire to " annihilate " Germans prior to the Holocaust . An August 1941 appeal to the world by a group of Soviet Jews seeking support against Germany was also cited by Nolte as evidence of Jewish determination to thwart the '' Reich '' . Nolte argued that the Nazis felt forced to undertake the Holocaust by Hitler 's conclusion that the entire Jewish population of the world had declared war on Germany . From Nolte 's point of view , the Holocaust was an act of “ Asiatic barbarism ” forced on the Germans by the fear of what Joseph Stalin , whom Nolte believed to have significant Jewish support , might do to them . Nolte contends that the U.S. internment of Japanese Americans in the wake of the Pearl Harbor attack provides a parallel to the German " internment " of the Jewish population of Europe in concentration camps , in light of what Nolte alleges was the " Jewish " declaration of war on Germany in 1939 which Weizmann 's letter allegedly constitutes . Subsequently , Nolte expanded upon these views in his 1987 book '' Der europäische Bürgerkrieg , 1917 – 1945 '' ( '' The European Civil War , 1917 – 1945 '' ) in which he claimed that the entire 20th century was an age of genocide , totalitarianism , and tyranny , and that the Holocaust had been merely one chapter in the age of violence , terror and population displacement . Nolte claimed that this age had started with the genocide of the Armenians during World War I , and also included the Stalinist terror in the Soviet Union , the expulsion of ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe , Maoist terror in China as manifested in such events as the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution , compulsory population exchanges between Greece and Turkey from 1922 to 1923 , American war crimes in the Vietnam War , the Khmer Rouge genocide in Cambodia , and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan . In particular , Nolte argued that the expulsion of ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe in 1945 – 46 was " to be categorized ... under the concept of genocide " . As part of this argument , Nolte cited the 1979 book of the American historian Alfred-Maurice de Zayas , '' Die Wehrmacht Untersuchungsstelle '' , which argues that the Allies were just as guilty of war crimes as the Germans as the " happy evidence of the will to objectivity on the part of a foreigner " In Nolte 's opinion , Hitler was a " European citizen " who fought in defence of the values of the West against " Asiatic " Bolshevism , but due to his " total egocentrism " waged this struggle with unnecessary violence and brutality Since in Nolte 's view , the '' Shoah '' was not a unique crime , there is no reason to single out Germans for special criticism for the Holocaust . In addition , Nolte sees his work as the beginning of a much-needed revisionist treatment to end the " negative myth " of the Third Reich that dominates contemporary perceptions . Nolte took the view that the principle problem of German history was this “ negative myth ” of the Third Reich , which cast the Nazi era as the '' ne plus ultra '' of evil . Nolte wrote that after the American Civil War , the defeated South was cast as the symbol of total evil by the victorious North , but later “ revisionism ” became the dominant historical interpretation against the “ negative myth ” of the South , which led to a more balanced history of the Civil War with a greater understanding of the “ motives and way of life of the defeated Southern states ” , and led to the leaders of the Confederacy becoming great American heroes . Nolte urged that a similar “ revisionism ” destroy the “ negative myth ” of the Third Reich . Nolte argued that the Vietnam War , the Khmer Rouge genocide , the expulsion of " boat people " from Vietnam , the Islamic revolution in Iran , and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan meant the traditional picture of Nazi Germany as the ultimate in evil was no longer tenable , and proved the need for " revisionism " to put an end to the " negative myth " of the Third Reich . In Nolte 's view , the first efforts at revisionism of the Nazi period failed because A. J. P. Taylor 's 1961 book '' The Origins of the Second World War '' was only a part of the " anti-German literature of indictment " while David Hoggan in '' Der erzwugnene Krieg '' , by only seeking to examine why World War II broke out in 1939 , " cut himself off from the really decisive questions " . Then the next revisionist efforts Nolte cites were the Italian historian Domenico Settembrini 's favorable treatment of Fascism for saving Italy from Communism , and the British historian Timothy Mason 's studies in working class German history . The best of the revisionists according to Nolte is David Irving , with whom Nolte finds some fault , although " not all of Irving 's theses and points can be dismissed with such ease " . Nolte praises Irving as the first to understand that Weizmann 's letter to Chamberlain was a " Jewish declaration of war " on Germany that justified the " interning " of the Jews of Europe . Nolte went on to praise Irving for putting the Holocaust " in a more comprehensive perspective " by comparing it to the British fire-bombing of Hamburg in 1943 , which Nolte views as just much of an act of genocide as the " Final Solution " . The sort of revisionism needed to end the " negative myth " of the Third Reich is , in Nolte 's opinion , an examination of the impact of the Russian Revolution on Germany

		ANSWER=Albert Hotopp
		GOLD_MENTION=surge in political purges
		CONTEXT=There were numerous exiled German communists in Moscow , and they all used to report on one another to the Soviet authorities during the surge in political purges that accompanied growing political tensions domestically and internationally at this time . Such information demonstrated loyalty and was often blended with impressions or combined with denunciations . Hotropp himself provided a written report on Herwarth Walden , a fellow teacher at the Foreign Languages Institute who was later arrested . There was a perception that reports of this nature did not in themselves cause the authorities to arrest suspects , but they were certainly used by the NKVD where they provided evidential support for arrests that took place . Albert Hotopp 's own turn came on 31 May 1941 when he was arrested . On 1 August 1942 he was condemned to death . Available records are silent as to what happened next , but it is likely that he died shortly afterwards , probably in a Soviet labour camp . His wife Gertrud and their daughters were sent to continue their lives in Kazakhstan . His widow finally made her way back to East Germany in 1955 , after which she survived another thirty years . Albert Hotopp was formally rehabilitated by the Soviets in 1960

It was credited with the liberation of the town of Novozybkov on September 25 , 1943 . After battling its way through eastern Belarus during the autumn and winter of 1943 – 44 , and then helping complete its liberation during Operation Bagration , it was moved to East Prussia , where it took part in the Battle of Königsberg in the spring of 1945 , ending the war on the Baltic coast near the Zemland Peninsula . In the course of these campaigns the 307th compiled a battle record to rival a Guards unit ( which it narrowly missed out on ) but was nevertheless disbanded on the second - last day of 1945 .

		GOLD_MENTION=deportation of his people
		CONTEXT=From 18 – 20 May 1944 he was permitted to take a three-day vacation from combat to visit his family in Alupka , not long after the Soviets retook control of Crimea . During the visit , he witnessed the deportation of his people and learned his brother Imran was wanted by the NKVD . While he had been risking life and limb to expel German invaders from Crimea , Imran had been suspected of joining the German auxiliary police . After the Soviets retook Crimea , Imran was tried and sentenced by a military tribunal in 1946 for his activities as a guard at a concentration camp . Leaflets describing the feats of Amet-khan Sultan against the Germans had been airdropped over Crimea while it was occupied by the Germans , resulting in the Gestapo finding the leaflets and tracking down his parents for execution . The only thing that saved his parents from being murdered by the Gestapo was Imran 's presence in the Schutzmannschaft . During the deportation an NKVD officer who entered the household attempted to force Amet-khan and his parents to leave Crimea , but they fought and a struggle ensued ; after Amet-khan identified himself as a Hero of the Soviet Union to the NKVD officer who had attacked him , and his status as a war hero was confirmed by Hero of the Soviet Union , Pavel Golovachev who was present at the scene . The NKVD officer began questioning him about his ethnic background , decided that Amet-khan was technically Dagestani , and said that there was an order to deport the Crimean Tatar people . The NKVD continued to deport the Crimean Tatar people , and his mother , who was a Tatar , was sent to a transportation point , but after other members of the Air Force who were friends of Amet-khan made it clear to the NKVD that she and the rest of her immediate family were exempt from deportation because she was married to a Lak and hence no longer considered a Crimean Tatar in the eyes of the law , she and her husband were not sent to Uzbekistan ; Imran was sentenced in 1946 but the rest of Amet-khan 's immediate family was not subject to the collective punishment of the deportation in its entirety . They still had to leave Crimea for the remainder of the war , but they were given more time to pack and drove to Dagestan instead of Uzbekistan

It has 76 residents ( 2001 census ) and it belongs to the municipal unit of East Selino ( Anatoliko Selino ) . The village is built in a wild , beautiful position , at an elevation of 510m . Deep gorges and steep mountain cliffs surround the village . Southwest of the village at a height of 200 m. is the cave of Cyclops , possibly related to the namesake tale found in Homer 's Odyssey . Koustogerako has a notable history . It was burned twice by the Venetians for being the birthplace of Kantanoleon ( a famous rebel who fought against the Venetians ) and once again in 1821 by the Turks . Finally , the Nazis razed Koustogerako , because it was a partizan resistance center against the Germans in World War II . The villagers of Koustogerako gave some of the fiercest and most renowned guerrilla fights , resisting the Nazi occupation . In 1943 , the Germans scourged the villages of Moni , Livadas and Koustogerako . They herded about thirty five women and children of Koustogerako lined them up in front of a machine gun .

		GOLD_MENTION=Stalinist terror
		CONTEXT=The crux of Nolte 's thesis was presented when he wrote : " It is a notable shortcoming of the literature about National Socialism that it does not know or does not want to admit to what degree all the deeds — with the sole exception of the technical process of gassing — that the National Socialists later committed had already been described in a voluminous literature of the early 1920s : mass deportations and shootings , torture , death camps , extermination of entire groups using strictly objective selection criteria , and public demands for the annihilation of millions of guiltless people who were thought to be " enemies " . It is probable that many of these reports were exaggerated . It is certain that the “ White Terror ” also committed terrible deeds , even though its program contained no analogy to the “ extermination of the bourgeoisie ” . Nonetheless , the following question must seem permissible , even unavoidable : Did the National Socialists or Hitler perhaps commit an “ Asiatic ” deed merely because they and their ilk considered themselves to be the potential victims of an “ Asiatic ” deed ? Was n’t the ' Gulag Archipelago ' more original than Auschwitz ? Was the Bolshevik murder of an entire class not the logical and factual '' prius '' of the " racial murder " of National Socialism ? Can not Hitler 's most secret deeds be explained by the fact that he had '' not '' forgotten the rat cage ? Did Auschwitz in its root causes not originate in a past that would not pass ? " Nolte wrote the principle problem " for the coming generations ... must be liberation from collectivist thinking " , which Nolte claimed dominated scholarship on Nazi Germany . Nolte ended his essay with calling for a " more comprehensive debate " about the memory of Nazi Germany that would allow for " the past that will not go away " to finally go away " as is suitable for every past " . Nolte subsequently presented a 1940 book by American author Theodore N. Kaufman entitled '' Germany Must Perish ! '' . The text contends that all German men should be sterilized , evidencing , according to Nolte , the alleged " Jewish " desire to " annihilate " Germans prior to the Holocaust . An August 1941 appeal to the world by a group of Soviet Jews seeking support against Germany was also cited by Nolte as evidence of Jewish determination to thwart the '' Reich '' . Nolte argued that the Nazis felt forced to undertake the Holocaust by Hitler 's conclusion that the entire Jewish population of the world had declared war on Germany . From Nolte 's point of view , the Holocaust was an act of “ Asiatic barbarism ” forced on the Germans by the fear of what Joseph Stalin , whom Nolte believed to have significant Jewish support , might do to them . Nolte contends that the U.S. internment of Japanese Americans in the wake of the Pearl Harbor attack provides a parallel to the German " internment " of the Jewish population of Europe in concentration camps , in light of what Nolte alleges was the " Jewish " declaration of war on Germany in 1939 which Weizmann 's letter allegedly constitutes . Subsequently , Nolte expanded upon these views in his 1987 book '' Der europäische Bürgerkrieg , 1917 – 1945 '' ( '' The European Civil War , 1917 – 1945 '' ) in which he claimed that the entire 20th century was an age of genocide , totalitarianism , and tyranny , and that the Holocaust had been merely one chapter in the age of violence , terror and population displacement . Nolte claimed that this age had started with the genocide of the Armenians during World War I , and also included the Stalinist terror in the Soviet Union , the expulsion of ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe , Maoist terror in China as manifested in such events as the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution , compulsory population exchanges between Greece and Turkey from 1922 to 1923 , American war crimes in the Vietnam War , the Khmer Rouge genocide in Cambodia , and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan . In particular , Nolte argued that the expulsion of ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe in 1945 – 46 was " to be categorized ... under the concept of genocide " . As part of this argument , Nolte cited the 1979 book of the American historian Alfred-Maurice de Zayas , '' Die Wehrmacht Untersuchungsstelle '' , which argues that the Allies were just as guilty of war crimes as the Germans as the " happy evidence of the will to objectivity on the part of a foreigner " In Nolte 's opinion , Hitler was a " European citizen " who fought in defence of the values of the West against " Asiatic " Bolshevism , but due to his " total egocentrism " waged this struggle with unnecessary violence and brutality Since in Nolte 's view , the '' Shoah '' was not a unique crime , there is no reason to single out Germans for special criticism for the Holocaust . In addition , Nolte sees his work as the beginning of a much-needed revisionist treatment to end the " negative myth " of the Third Reich that dominates contemporary perceptions . Nolte took the view that the principle problem of German history was this “ negative myth ” of the Third Reich , which cast the Nazi era as the '' ne plus ultra '' of evil . Nolte wrote that after the American Civil War , the defeated South was cast as the symbol of total evil by the victorious North , but later “ revisionism ” became the dominant historical interpretation against the “ negative myth ” of the South , which led to a more balanced history of the Civil War with a greater understanding of the “ motives and way of life of the defeated Southern states ” , and led to the leaders of the Confederacy becoming great American heroes . Nolte urged that a similar “ revisionism ” destroy the “ negative myth ” of the Third Reich . Nolte argued that the Vietnam War , the Khmer Rouge genocide , the expulsion of " boat people " from Vietnam , the Islamic revolution in Iran , and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan meant the traditional picture of Nazi Germany as the ultimate in evil was no longer tenable , and proved the need for " revisionism " to put an end to the " negative myth " of the Third Reich . In Nolte 's view , the first efforts at revisionism of the Nazi period failed because A. J. P. Taylor 's 1961 book '' The Origins of the Second World War '' was only a part of the " anti-German literature of indictment " while David Hoggan in '' Der erzwugnene Krieg '' , by only seeking to examine why World War II broke out in 1939 , " cut himself off from the really decisive questions " . Then the next revisionist efforts Nolte cites were the Italian historian Domenico Settembrini 's favorable treatment of Fascism for saving Italy from Communism , and the British historian Timothy Mason 's studies in working class German history . The best of the revisionists according to Nolte is David Irving , with whom Nolte finds some fault , although " not all of Irving 's theses and points can be dismissed with such ease " . Nolte praises Irving as the first to understand that Weizmann 's letter to Chamberlain was a " Jewish declaration of war " on Germany that justified the " interning " of the Jews of Europe . Nolte went on to praise Irving for putting the Holocaust " in a more comprehensive perspective " by comparing it to the British fire-bombing of Hamburg in 1943 , which Nolte views as just much of an act of genocide as the " Final Solution " . The sort of revisionism needed to end the " negative myth " of the Third Reich is , in Nolte 's opinion , an examination of the impact of the Russian Revolution on Germany

		ANSWER=Albert Hotopp
		GOLD_MENTION=surge in political purges
		CONTEXT=There were numerous exiled German communists in Moscow , and they all used to report on one another to the Soviet authorities during the surge in political purges that accompanied growing political tensions domestically and internationally at this time . Such information demonstrated loyalty and was often blended with impressions or combined with denunciations . Hotropp himself provided a written report on Herwarth Walden , a fellow teacher at the Foreign Languages Institute who was later arrested . There was a perception that reports of this nature did not in themselves cause the authorities to arrest suspects , but they were certainly used by the NKVD where they provided evidential support for arrests that took place . Albert Hotopp 's own turn came on 31 May 1941 when he was arrested . On 1 August 1942 he was condemned to death . Available records are silent as to what happened next , but it is likely that he died shortly afterwards , probably in a Soviet labour camp . His wife Gertrud and their daughters were sent to continue their lives in Kazakhstan . His widow finally made her way back to East Germany in 1955 , after which she survived another thirty years . Albert Hotopp was formally rehabilitated by the Soviets in 1960

		GOLD_MENTION=Great Terror
		CONTEXT=The British historian A. J. P. Taylor wrote in 1945 that National Socialism was inevitable because the Germans wanted " to repudiate the equality with the peoples of ( central and ) eastern Europe which had then been forced upon them " after 1918 . Taylor wrote that : " During the preceding eighty years the Germans had sacrificed to the '' Reich '' all their liberties ; they demanded as a reward the enslavement of others . No German recognized the Czechs or Poles as equals . Therefore , every German desired the achievement which only total war could give . By no other means could the '' Reich '' be held together . It had been made by conquest and for conquest ; if it ever gave up its career of conquest , it would dissolve . " During Stalin 's Great Terror in the Soviet Union , the largest ethnic shooting and deportation operation , known as the Polish Operation , took place from about 25 August 1937 through 15 November 1938 . According to Soviet NKVD archives , 111,091 Poles , and people accused of ties with Poland , were executed , and 28,744 were sentenced to death-ridden labor camps , for a total of 139,835 Polish victims . This number constitutes 10 per cent of the officially persecuted persons during the entire Yezhovshchina period , with confirming NKVD documents . The coordinated actions of the Soviet NKVD and the Communist Party in 1937 – 1938 against the Polish minority living in the Soviet Union was a targeting of 0.4 percent of Soviet citizens by ethnicity . US historian Timothy D. Snyder says : " It is hard not to see the Soviet " Polish Operation " of 1937-38 as genocidal . " Simon Sebag Montefiore presents a similar opinion , Prof. Marek Jan Chodakiewicz , Dr. Tomasz Sommer , and others . In typical Stalinist fashion , the murdered Polish families were accused of " anti-Soviet " activities and state terrorism . Michael Ellman has said in the context of the UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide that Stalin 's Polish Operation " might well qualify as genocide " but because there has been no legal tribunal to try the crimes of Stalinism , there is no authoritative ruling on the legal characterisation

		CONTEXT=Oliver Sava of '' The A.V.

" Sava noted that while the episode was humorous , much of the comedy was undercut by the tragic and distressing nature of Finn 's story . Andrew Tran of Overmental argued that " the episode ... dissects vividly that bottomless feeling of midlife wanderlust ... not the road-trippy , running-through-the-fields kind but rather the life-map-disappearing-in-your-hands , what-the-hell-is-next kind . " Tran contended that , through the use of video game tropes , explores the idea that life is ultimately unpredictable that there " is no map that you can make for yourself ( or that anyone can give you ) that can account for everything you ’re going to encounter " . " The Hall of Egress " has been highly lauded by the show 's production staff , with series creator Pendleton Ward in particular naming it as one of his favorites .

		GOLD_MENTION=1992 Eurovision Song Contest
		CONTEXT=Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny appears at his back door in his boxers and invites viewers for a look around his house ; including a ( now fully dressed ) encounter with his karaoke machine . He then sets off on his bicycle for an interview at RTÉ . Alas his attempts to get there unscathed come undone when his bike receives a puncture and he has to resort to queueing for a bus like the common person . When the bus arrives , he realises he has no money but after asking for some spare cash from an innocent bystander , he turns around to find the bus has pulled off again . In the RTÉ carpark , Pat Kenny sits in his car , casting his eyes over his fellow broadcasters and enviously longing to join them in their casual conversation . When he finally plucks up the courage to approach Marian Finucane and Joe Duffy , the latter is overheard insulting him and Pat heads back to his car . With Pat due on air in ten minutes , Tom decides to join him in the passenger seat but he must first overcome the clutches of George Hook , who once again attempts to lure him to Newstalk . Pat asks Tom what the world really thinks of him , believing that his assistant is the only person in the world who is loyal to him . Tom attempts to avoid the question , distracting Pat by ( wrongly ) telling him that Enda Kenny has just arrived . Eventually Tom opts to tell Pat , albeit with much hesitation , that he is '' " absolutely unbelievable " '' . At that moment Enda Kenny finally arrives at the studio , still in his biker gear and collapses with exhaustion on the steps having raced through Dublin to make the interview on schedule . Kenny and Kenny square off on air and , with Pat faced with an adversary so similar in perceived personality , popularity and name he is even more unable to cope with his feelings of unworthiness than usual . Pat breaks down live on air , mistaking Enda 's rival , Taoiseach Bertie Ahern , for his own rival , '' Liveline '' presenter Joe Duffy . This prompts Enda to join him in his moment of unrelenting emotion . The next morning Tom arrives at Pat 's house . Pat assumes he has come with his P45 or details of who is to take over the mantle of the station 's highest earning broadcaster . However Tom merely points to two giant sacks of complimentary mail he has carried on his bike from RTÉ headquarters . One of them even wants to sleep with the presenter , who quickly places the letter in the left front pocket of his dressing gown . Pat is astounded to discover he is all over the news and that celebrities such as 1992 Eurovision Song Contest winner Linda Martin , music mogul Louis Walsh and Boyzone lead singer Ronan Keating are talking about him . He hurries indoors to switch on his television . There he finds that figures from the worlds of sport and politics including Irish national football team manager Steve Staunton , Ireland rugby manager Eddie O'Sullivan and Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams are lining up in their droves to pay tribute to him . He is intrigued to find Fintan O'Toole has also spoken greatly of him but becomes irritated when he finds that Steve Staunton seems to have taken over the airwaves , typically reiterating how Pat has done a great job , how he works for the team , has delivered a great result and what else can you say . Meanwhile , Bertie Ahern repeatedly rings Tom 's mobile to request an interview with Pat , but on each occasion Tom tells him to ring back later . Pat and Tom stroll into RTÉ , where George Hook is astounded to hear of Pat 's newfound popularity . He is adamant that Tom will soon join him at Newstalk but Tom shows his unswaying loyalty by declaring he will go only where Pat goes . On Friday night George slips into RTÉ and just as an episode of '' The Late Late Show '' is coming to a close , approaches Pat 's dressing room . George is inadvertently knocked to the floor by a stray microphone where he lies moaning until Pat emerges from the dressing room . Pat steps over George and leaves RTÉ with Tom , telling his assistant that he should not allow anyone to undermine him before demanding that he open the door

		GOLD_MENTION=last year 's ceremony
		CONTEXT=The show received a mixed reception from media publications . On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes , the show holds an approval rating of 43 % based on 30 critics , and summarized , " The 90th Academy Awards played it safe and hit no major snags -- but by clocking in at over four hours , returning host Jimmy Kimmel and company wore out their welcome long before the surprise ending . " Hank Stuever of '' The Washington Post '' marked , " In his second year , Kimmel has shown that the telecast need n't be anything but sharp and sure , with a funny host whose bits are manageable , shareable and – best of all – forgotten . We 're not making showbiz history here ; we 're just trying to get through another Oscar night . " Chief critic David Edelstein of '' Vulture '' wrote , " This was the best , most inspiring , and most sheerly likable Academy Awards telecast I 've ever seen . ... It was also – in terms of the actual awards – among the most disappointing . " '' Vanity Fair '' s , Richard Lawson wrote , " As a host , Kimmel struck a careful , appropriately measured tone ... All told , Sunday 's ceremony did an admirable job of recognizing all the turmoil surrounding it while maintaining the silly , chintzy trappings that so many of us tune into the Oscars for . " CNN 's Brian Lowry quipped , " The Oscars are a big , unwieldy beast , which invariably try to serve too many masters . Yet if the intent was ultimately to maintain a celebratory tone without ignoring either the outside world or the elephant in the room throughout this year 's awards , host Jimmy Kimmel and the show itself largely succeeded . " Others were more critical of the show . Television critic Maureen Ryan of '' Variety '' said , " All things considered , the show had a more or less low-key vibe . Normally it takes about two hours for the numbing effect to set in , but despite host Jimmy Kimmel 's best efforts , Sunday 's telecast started to feel a bit languid and low-energy far earlier . " Television critic James Poniewozik of '' The New York Times '' said , " despite the recent upheaval in Hollywood , the ceremony at large still focused mainly on celebration and glitter literally , in the case of the blinding set , which looked as if the ceremony were encased in an enormous geode . There 's also the perennial problem of bloat . The hitch , of course , is that every part of the show has its constituency . " Darren Franich of '' Entertainment Weekly '' wrote , " What fun we had at this year 's Oscars ! Long show , sure , but where to cut it ? " Writing for '' Deadline '' Greg Evans said , " Did the nearly four-hour running time contain any moments for the Oscar ages ? Probably not . " David Wiegand of the '' San Francisco Chronicle '' wrote , " Even the hope that the noise of clapping might keep the audience at home and in the theater awake , there was little of that for anything except the entrance of actors of advance age . " '' The Oregonian '' columnist Kristi Turnquist wrote , " Was it respectful ? Absolutely . Did it make for kind of a dull , earnest Oscars show ? Yeah , kind of . " Attaining 26.5 million U.S. viewers according to Nielsen ratings , the ceremony 's telecast had a 16-percent drop in viewership from last year 's ceremony and had the lowest U.S. viewership in Oscar history . On March 6 , after the final ratings were confirmed , President Donald Trump took to his Twitter account , saying , " Lowest rated Oscars in HISTORY . Problem is , we do n't have stars anymore – except your President ( just kidding , of course ) ! " . In response , Kimmel also tweeted , saying , " Thanks , lowest rated President in HISTORY . " In July 2018 , the ceremony presentation received eight nominations for the 70th Primetime Creative Arts Emmys

		GOLD_MENTION=Video Music Awards
		CONTEXT=The ceremony was held on a night other than Sunday for the first time since 1976 ( the 28th Primetime Emmy Awards were also staged on a Monday that year , May 17 ) . The ceremony 's unusual date — a Monday night in late August — was due to two factors , primary being NBC 's commitment to '' Sunday Night Football '' ; since acquiring the National Football League 's Sunday night game package in 2006 , NBC , when it is their turn in the four-network rotation to air the Primetime Emmy Awards , usually schedules the ceremony for the Sunday before Labor Day weekend , to avoid conflicts with '' SNF '' in mid-September ( when ABC , CBS , or Fox normally air the ceremony ) . NBC 's ideal date on the 2014 calendar for the ceremony ( Sunday , August 24 ) led to the other scheduling factor — MTV 's Video Music Awards , which were set for that night more than a year in advance ( and would be staged in the L.A. area as well , at The Forum in Inglewood ) . On January 28 , 2014 , rather than go head-to-head with the VMA 's , NBC announced that the ceremony would take place on Monday , August 25 . The move would allow NBC to commit to a preseason '' Sunday Night Football '' broadcast for the 24th ( a game between the Cincinnati Bengals and Arizona Cardinals ) ; it also ensured the tradition of staging the Primetime Emmy Awards the weekend after the Creative Arts Emmy Awards ( that ceremony was already set for August 16 )

		CONTEXT=In preparation for the 1880 presidential election , Senator Conkling became the leader of the movement for the nomination of General Grant for a third term in the Presidency . He had a strong regard for Grant , and was hostile to the other two leading Republican candidates , Sherman , with whom he had come into conflict during Hayes 's administration , and James G. Blaine , whose bitter political and personal enemy he had been for 24 years . The convention , after 33 generally consistent , inconclusive ballots , by a combination of the Blaine and Sherman interests , nominated James A. Garfield on the 36th ballot . Garfield 's supporters wanted to heal the rift caused by Garfield 's nomination by offering the vice presidency to a Stalwart . They first approached Levi P. Morton , who sought Conkling 's advice . Unhappy over the outcome of the presidential nomination fight and believing Garfield was likely to lose , Conkling counseled Morton to decline , which he did . Garfield 's supporters then approached another prominent Stalwart , Chester A. Arthur . Conkling advised Arthur to decline , as he had advised Morton .

		CONTEXT=Prior to and during the Civil War , Pennsylvania was a divided state . Although Pennsylvania had outlawed slavery , many conservative Pennsylvanians believed that the federal government should not interfere with the institution of slavery . One such individual was Democrat James Buchanan , the last pre-Civil War president . Buchanan 's party had generally won presidential and gubernatorial elections in Pennsylvania . However , the nascent Republican Party 's first convention took place in Philadelphia , and the 1860 elections saw the Republican Party win the state 's presidential vote and the governor 's office . After the failure of the Crittenden Compromise , the secession of the South , and the Battle of Fort Sumter , the Civil War began with Pennsylvania as a key member of the Union . Despite the Republican victory the 1860 election , Democrats remained powerful in the state , and several " copperheads " called for peace during the war . The Democrats re-took control of the state legislature in the 1862 election , but incumbent Republican Governor Andrew Curtin retained control of the governorship in 1863 . In the 1864 election , President Lincoln narrowly defeated Pennsylvania native George B. McClellan for the state 's electoral votes

		GOLD_MENTION=Democratic National Convention
		CONTEXT=The reassembled delegates had heard rumors that Harding was the choice of a cabal of senators . Although this was not true , delegates believed it , and sought a way out by voting for Harding . When balloting resumed on the morning of June 12 , Harding gained votes on each of the next four ballots , rising to 133 as the two front runners saw little change . Lodge then declared a three-hour recess , to the outrage of Daugherty , who raced to the podium , and confronted him , " You can not defeat this man this way ! The motion was not carried ! You can not defeat this man ! " Lodge and others used the break to try to stop the Harding momentum and make RNC Chairman Hays the nominee , a scheme Hays refused to have anything to do with . The ninth ballot , after some initial suspense , saw delegation after delegation break for Harding , who took the lead with 374 votes to 249 for Wood and 121 for Lowden ( Johnson had 83 ) . Lowden released his delegates to Harding , and the tenth ballot , held at 6 p.m. , was a mere formality , with Harding finishing with 672 votes to 156 for Wood . The nomination was made unanimous . The delegates , desperate to leave town before they incurred more hotel expenses , then proceeded to the vice presidential nomination . Harding wanted Senator Irvine Lenroot of Wisconsin , who was unwilling to run , but before Lenroot 's name could be withdrawn and another candidate decided on , an Oregon delegate proposed Governor Coolidge , which was met with a roar of approval from the delegates . Coolidge , popular for his role in breaking the Boston police strike of 1919 , was nominated for vice president , receiving two and a fraction votes more than Harding had . James Morgan wrote in '' The Boston Globe '' : " The delegates would not listen to remaining in Chicago over Sunday ... the President makers did not have a clean shirt . On such things , Rollo , turns the destiny of nations . " The Harding/Coolidge ticket was quickly backed by Republican newspapers , but those of other viewpoints expressed disappointment . The '' New York World '' found Harding the least-qualified candidate since James Buchanan , deeming the Ohio senator a " weak and mediocre " man who " never had an original idea . " The Hearst newspapers called Harding " the flag-bearer of a new Senatorial autocracy . " '' The New York Times '' described the Republican presidential candidate as " a very respectable Ohio politician of the second class . " The Democratic National Convention opened in San Francisco on June 28 , 1920 , under a shadow cast by Woodrow Wilson , who wished to be nominated for a third term . Delegates were convinced Wilson 's health would not permit him to serve , and looked elsewhere for a candidate . Former Treasury Secretary William G. McAdoo was a major contender , but he was Wilson 's son-in-law , and refused to consider a nomination so long as the president wanted it . Many at the convention voted for McAdoo anyway , and a deadlock ensued with Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer . On the 44th ballot , the Democrats nominated Governor Cox for president , with his running mate Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt . As Cox was , when not in politics , a newspaper owner and editor , this placed two Ohio editors against each other for the presidency , and some complained there was no real political choice . Both Cox and Harding were economic conservatives , and were reluctant progressives at best

		GOLD_MENTION=death of McKinley
		CONTEXT=The paper was often controversial ; encouraging propaganda of the deed or direct political action or taking responsibility for a Frankfurt bombing of a police station . Such claims as well as instructions to build explosives published by Most within '' Freiheit '' and in his pamphlet , '' Science of Revolutionary Warfare '' , further contributed to the public 's generalization of anarchists as violent criminals despite a relatively low body count compared to other radical groups such as white nationalists . This rhetoric once again lead to imprisonment , particularly after the paper once again supported assassination after the death of McKinley at the hands of an anarchist in 1901 . When others from their circle failed to step up to maintain '' Freiheit '' in Most 's absence , Minkin stepped in as editor and manager for two years while he was imprisoned . Without Minkin 's contributions and her nurturing of Most 's continued political activity , Most would have let the paper fold and his influence wane

		CONTEXT=The first official Republican convention in Illinois was held on May 29 , 1856 , in Bloomington . Chairman John M. Palmer was elected convention president after his opening address . Nine vice presidents and five secretaries were then elected . The convention nominated Bissell for governor with Francis Hoffmann as lieutenant governor , Ozias M. Hatch for secretary of state , Jesse K. Dubois as auditor , and James Miller as treasurer . Hoffmann was found to be ineligible for his position due to a residency requirement , and John Wood was nominated in his place . The following resolutions defining the party platform were approved : Resolved , That foregoing all former differences of opinions upon other questions , we pledge ourselves to unite in opposition to the present administration and to the party which upholds and supports it and to use all honorable and constitutional means to wrest the Government from the unworthy hands which now control it and to bring it back in its administration to the principles and practices of Washington , Jefferson and their great and good compatriots of the Revolution . Resolved , That foregoing all former differences of opinions upon other questions , we pledge ourselves to unite in opposition to the present administration of the Government ; that under the Constitution Congress possesses the power to prohibit slavery in the Territories ; and that , whilst we will maintain all constitutional rights of the South , we also hold that justice , humanity , the principles of freedom as expressed in our Declaration of Independence and our national constitution , and the purity and perpetuity of our Government require that that power shall be exerted to prevent the extension of slavery into territory heretofore free . Resolved , That the repeal of the Missouri Compromise was unwise and injurious ; an open and aggravated violation of the plighted faith of the States , and that the attempt of the present administration to force slavery into Kansas against the known wishes of the legal voters of that Territory is an arbitrary and tyrannous violation of the rights of the people to govern themselves , and that we will strive by all constitutional means to secure to Kansas and Nebraska the legal guaranty against slavery of which they were deprived at the cost of the violation of the plighted faith of the nation . Resolved , That we are devoted to the Union and will , to the last extremity , defend it against the efforts now being made by the dis-unionists of this administration to compass its dissolution , and that we will support the Constitution of the United States , in all its provisions regarding it , as the sacred bond of our Union and the only safeguard for the preservation of the rights of ourselves and our posterity . Resolved , That we are in favor of the immediate admission of Kansas as a member of this Confederacy under the constitution adopted by the people of said Territory . Resolved , That the spirit of our institutions as well as the Constitution of our country , guarantees the liberty of conscience as well as political freedom , and that we will proscribe no one by legislation or otherwise on account of religious opinions , or in consequence of place of birth . Lincoln delivered the closing address . The speech was purportedly so captivating that no reporter made a record of it . The address has become known as Lincoln 's Lost Speech . The delegates to the convention were : The Democrats had nominated Richardson for governor at their convention earlier that month . The remnants of the Whig party declined to run a candidate . The first Republican National Convention met that June , nominating John C. Fremont for president . Fremont was defeated handily in his bid for president , including in Illinois , but the Republican state ticket in Illinois was successful . Bissell became the first Governor from a party other than the Democrats since 1838 . Republicans would win every subsequent gubernatorial election through 1893

		CONTEXT=In preparation for the 1880 presidential election , Senator Conkling became the leader of the movement for the nomination of General Grant for a third term in the Presidency . He had a strong regard for Grant , and was hostile to the other two leading Republican candidates , Sherman , with whom he had come into conflict during Hayes 's administration , and James G. Blaine , whose bitter political and personal enemy he had been for 24 years . The convention , after 33 generally consistent , inconclusive ballots , by a combination of the Blaine and Sherman interests , nominated James A. Garfield on the 36th ballot . Garfield 's supporters wanted to heal the rift caused by Garfield 's nomination by offering the vice presidency to a Stalwart . They first approached Levi P. Morton , who sought Conkling 's advice . Unhappy over the outcome of the presidential nomination fight and believing Garfield was likely to lose , Conkling counseled Morton to decline , which he did . Garfield 's supporters then approached another prominent Stalwart , Chester A. Arthur . Conkling advised Arthur to decline , as he had advised Morton . Arthur decided to accept , and Garfield and he narrowly won the November election

" He also stated , " In the long series of acts of indirect aggression , the first was the strenuous agitation by citizens of the Northern States , in Congress and out of it , of the question of Negro emancipation in the Southern States . " President Pierce supported the Kansas - Nebraska act . This neutralized the issue of slavery in the central states , and did not say whether to allow it or not .

		CONTEXT=The first official Republican convention in Illinois was held on May 29 , 1856 , in Bloomington . Chairman John M. Palmer was elected convention president after his opening address . Nine vice presidents and five secretaries were then elected . The convention nominated Bissell for governor with Francis Hoffmann as lieutenant governor , Ozias M. Hatch for secretary of state , Jesse K. Dubois as auditor , and James Miller as treasurer . Hoffmann was found to be ineligible for his position due to a residency requirement , and John Wood was nominated in his place . The following resolutions defining the party platform were approved : Resolved , That foregoing all former differences of opinions upon other questions , we pledge ourselves to unite in opposition to the present administration and to the party which upholds and supports it and to use all honorable and constitutional means to wrest the Government from the unworthy hands which now control it and to bring it back in its administration to the principles and practices of Washington , Jefferson and their great and good compatriots of the Revolution . Resolved , That foregoing all former differences of opinions upon other questions , we pledge ourselves to unite in opposition to the present administration of the Government ; that under the Constitution Congress possesses the power to prohibit slavery in the Territories ; and that , whilst we will maintain all constitutional rights of the South , we also hold that justice , humanity , the principles of freedom as expressed in our Declaration of Independence and our national constitution , and the purity and perpetuity of our Government require that that power shall be exerted to prevent the extension of slavery into territory heretofore free . Resolved , That the repeal of the Missouri Compromise was unwise and injurious ; an open and aggravated violation of the plighted faith of the States , and that the attempt of the present administration to force slavery into Kansas against the known wishes of the legal voters of that Territory is an arbitrary and tyrannous violation of the rights of the people to govern themselves , and that we will strive by all constitutional means to secure to Kansas and Nebraska the legal guaranty against slavery of which they were deprived at the cost of the violation of the plighted faith of the nation . Resolved , That we are devoted to the Union and will , to the last extremity , defend it against the efforts now being made by the dis-unionists of this administration to compass its dissolution , and that we will support the Constitution of the United States , in all its provisions regarding it , as the sacred bond of our Union and the only safeguard for the preservation of the rights of ourselves and our posterity . Resolved , That we are in favor of the immediate admission of Kansas as a member of this Confederacy under the constitution adopted by the people of said Territory . Resolved , That the spirit of our institutions as well as the Constitution of our country , guarantees the liberty of conscience as well as political freedom , and that we will proscribe no one by legislation or otherwise on account of religious opinions , or in consequence of place of birth .

Resolved , That the repeal of the Missouri Compromise was unwise and injurious ; an open and aggravated violation of the plighted faith of the States , and that the attempt of the present administration to force slavery into Kansas against the known wishes of the legal voters of that Territory is an arbitrary and tyrannous violation of the rights of the people to govern themselves , and that we will strive by all constitutional means to secure to Kansas and Nebraska the legal guaranty against slavery of which they were deprived at the cost of the violation of the plighted faith of the nation . Resolved , That we are devoted to the Union and will , to the last extremity , defend it against the efforts now being made by the dis-unionists of this administration to compass its dissolution , and that we will support the Constitution of the United States , in all its provisions regarding it , as the sacred bond of our Union and the only safeguard for the preservation of the rights of ourselves and our posterity . Resolved , That we are in favor of the immediate admission of Kansas as a member of this Confederacy under the constitution adopted by the people of said Territory .

		CONTEXT=Although some Republicans urged Hayes to run for a second term , he was looking forward to retirement , and so stuck to his 1876 promise to serve only one term . When Republicans convened in June 1880 , in Chicago , the fight for the nomination stood between former President Grant and Senator James Blaine . Congressman James A. Garfield , head of the Ohio delegation and chairman of the Convention Rules Committee , backed Treasury Secretary John Sherman . Elihu B. Washburne , George F. Edmunds , and William Windom also emerged as potential nominees . The convention deadlocked through thirty-three ballots , with Grant leading , followed by Blaine and Sherman . On the thirty-fourth ballot , Garfield received sixteen votes from Wisconsin , and Blaine and Sherman backers switched their support to Garfield on subsequent ballots . On the thirty-sixth ballot , Garfield won 399 votes to Grant 's 306 , putting him over the top and giving him the Republican nomination . The convention nominated Chester A. Arthur , the former port collector of New York , to serve as Garfield 's running mate . Hayes was pleased with the ticket , which provided a balance between Half-Breeds and Stalwarts , and he appreciated the convention 's endorsement of his presidency . The 1880 Democratic National Convention met in June and nominated General Winfield Scott Hancock . With the Democrats firmly in control of the South , a Republican victory would require strong performances in the Northern swing states of Indiana , Ohio , New Jersey , New York , and Connecticut . The Republican Party campaigned on their support for universal manhood suffrage and argued that Republican policies had led to economic prosperity . Though Hancock swept the South and won most of the Far West , Garfield won the election by dominating the Northeast and the Midwest . Garfield won an extremely narrow popular vote plurality , with a margin of less than 0.1 % . James B. Weaver of the Greenback Party took over 3 % of the popular vote . In the weeks following Garfield 's election , Hayes and Garfield worked with each other to assure a smooth transition of power

		CONTEXT=In 1886 , the Ohio legislature elected Sherman to a fifth term but , before long , he was considering another run for the presidency . To broaden his national image , he traveled to Nashville to give a speech defending Republican principles . He encouraged fairness in the treatment of black Americans and denounced their mistreatment at the hands of the " redeemed " Southern state governments . The tour had its effect , and Sherman 's hopes were high . His old friend , ex-President Hayes , thought him the best candidate . The early favorite for the nomination was again Blaine , but after Blaine wrote several letters denying any interest in the nomination , his supporters divided among other candidates , including Sherman . With no clear consensus going into the 1888 convention , delegates divided their support among an unusual number of favorite sons . Daniel H. Hastings of Pennsylvania placed Sherman 's name in nomination , seconded by Foraker ( who was , by then , Governor of Ohio ) . Sherman , at last , had a unified Ohio delegation behind him and led on the first ballot with 229 votes — more than double his nearest competitor , but well short of the 416 needed for nomination . Walter Q. Gresham of Indiana was in second place with 111 , followed by Russell A. Alger of Michigan with 84 . Sherman gained votes on the second ballot , but plateaued there ; by the fifth ballot , it was clear that he would gain no more delegates . He refused to withdraw , but his supporters began to abandon him ; by the eighth ballot , the delegates coalesced around Benjamin Harrison of Indiana and voted him the nomination . Sherman thought Harrison was a good candidate and bore him no ill will , but he did begrudge Alger , whom he believed " purchased the votes of many of the delegates from the southern states who had been instructed by their conventions to vote for me " . A loyal Republican , Sherman gave speeches for Harrison in Ohio and Indiana and was pleased with his victory over Cleveland that November . After 1888 , Sherman , aware that he would be seventy-three years old when the nomination was next open , resolved that from then on " no temptation of office will induce me to seek further political honors " and did not run for president again

		CONTEXT=Prior to and during the Civil War , Pennsylvania was a divided state . Although Pennsylvania had outlawed slavery , many conservative Pennsylvanians believed that the federal government should not interfere with the institution of slavery . One such individual was Democrat James Buchanan , the last pre-Civil War president . Buchanan 's party had generally won presidential and gubernatorial elections in Pennsylvania . However , the nascent Republican Party 's first convention took place in Philadelphia , and the 1860 elections saw the Republican Party win the state 's presidential vote and the governor 's office . After the failure of the Crittenden Compromise , the secession of the South , and the Battle of Fort Sumter , the Civil War began with Pennsylvania as a key member of the Union .

		GOLD_MENTION=1888 convention
		CONTEXT=In 1886 , the Ohio legislature elected Sherman to a fifth term but , before long , he was considering another run for the presidency . To broaden his national image , he traveled to Nashville to give a speech defending Republican principles . He encouraged fairness in the treatment of black Americans and denounced their mistreatment at the hands of the " redeemed " Southern state governments . The tour had its effect , and Sherman 's hopes were high . His old friend , ex-President Hayes , thought him the best candidate . The early favorite for the nomination was again Blaine , but after Blaine wrote several letters denying any interest in the nomination , his supporters divided among other candidates , including Sherman . With no clear consensus going into the 1888 convention , delegates divided their support among an unusual number of favorite sons . Daniel H. Hastings of Pennsylvania placed Sherman 's name in nomination , seconded by Foraker ( who was , by then , Governor of Ohio ) . Sherman , at last , had a unified Ohio delegation behind him and led on the first ballot with 229 votes — more than double his nearest competitor , but well short of the 416 needed for nomination . Walter Q. Gresham of Indiana was in second place with 111 , followed by Russell A. Alger of Michigan with 84 . Sherman gained votes on the second ballot , but plateaued there ; by the fifth ballot , it was clear that he would gain no more delegates . He refused to withdraw , but his supporters began to abandon him ; by the eighth ballot , the delegates coalesced around Benjamin Harrison of Indiana and voted him the nomination . Sherman thought Harrison was a good candidate and bore him no ill will , but he did begrudge Alger , whom he believed " purchased the votes of many of the delegates from the southern states who had been instructed by their conventions to vote for me " . A loyal Republican , Sherman gave speeches for Harrison in Ohio and Indiana and was pleased with his victory over Cleveland that November . After 1888 , Sherman , aware that he would be seventy-three years old when the nomination was next open , resolved that from then on " no temptation of office will induce me to seek further political honors " and did not run for president again

He did not receive a suspension for the incident however , returning to football the following week . After four matches Martin ranked fourth in the league for clearances and eighth for hard-ball gets . Media reports emerged after round 8 that the 18 year old Martin had received a significant contract offer from expansion club the Greater Western Sydney Giants .

The team improved on their 9 – 7 record from 2009 and reached the playoffs again . The Jets were the subject of HBO 's training camp series Hard Knocks . The Jets played their first pre-season game home against the New York Giants to open up Meadowlands Stadium . Many considered them AFC East favorites ; head coach Rex Ryan went so far as to guarantee a Super Bowl victory . Jets broke a team record with a franchise best 6 consecutive wins on the road with a win against the Lions , followed by a win against the Browns in week 10 . In the same victory against the Browns , the Jets became the first team in NFL history to win back - to - back road games in overtime . The Jets were the last NFL team to be undefeated on the road , before suffering a 45 – 3 loss at the New England Patriots in Week 13 . The Jets met the Patriots again five weeks later in the AFC Divisional Round back in Foxborough where New York upset New England 28 – 21 . The following week , the Jets lost 24 – 19 against the Pittsburgh Steelers in the AFC Championship , ending their hopes of returning to the Super Bowl for the first time in 43 years and ending what would have been a Cinderella run .

		GOLD_MENTION=64th Golden Globe Awards
		CONTEXT=Former television columnist for '' The Star-Ledger '' Alan Sepinwall expressed his boredom on the focus given on Grey 's relationships storylines while reviewing the second season 's finale : " On those occasions when Meredith 's not involved in a plot about her love life , I do kind of like her , but those moments are so infrequent compared to her constant angsting over McDreamy -- not to mention all those seemingly unrelated storylines that always turn into a metaphor for that relationship -- that I really , really ca n't stand her . " During the show 's third season , the development of the character received negative reviews , with Cristopher Monfette of '' IGN '' stating that her storyline has become " some bizarrely under-developed sub-plot about depression and giving Derek a season 's worth of reconsidering to do . " Also during the third season , Robert Rorke of the '' New York Post '' noted the decline in Meredith 's role in the show , expressing disappointment : " She used to be the queen of the romantic dilemmas , but lately , she 's been a little dopey , what with the endless McDreamy soliloquies . " Similarly , Macleans.ca found their storyline in the fourth season overused , " This whole ' Oh I need more time , ' but ' Oh , I 'm jealous if you look at someone else ' angst was tired in the second season , frustrating in the third and now a total channel changer . The will-they-or-won ' t-they plot does n't work because they 've already been in and out of that relationship too many times . Meredith is a nag and McDreamy is henpecked . " On a more positive note , her relationship with Shepherd was included in AOL TV 's list of the " Best TV Couples of All Time " and in the same list by '' TV Guide '' . During the sixth season the development of the character was praised , Glenn Diaz of '' BuddyTV '' commented that " You got ta love Mer when she 's gloomy . " , in addition to praising Pompeo 's performance . In her review of the episode Tainted Obligation she wrote " I felt for Meredith , but after Lexie 's heartfelt begging and pleading , I was happy that Mere finally grows up and casts her selfishness aside . Three seasons ago Meredith would never have dreamed of putting Lexie first , and I was proud of her for giving up part of her liver — her offer to get to know her dad was an even bigger milestone . " Reviewing the first part of the eighth season , TV Fanatic lauded the character and wrote : " this season belongs to Meredith Grey . She is the '' heart and soul of the show '' and has been outstanding . This is a character that used to be so dark and twisty and has now grown into a more mature woman . Ellen Pompeo has been at the top of her game this season . " '' Wit & Fancy '' praised the transformation of the character and stated , " Of course Meredith will still make rash decisions like when she took off with Zola or tampered with the trial , but she does things out of love and the kindness of her heart now and not because she is dark and twisty . Considering where Meredith was at the beginning and where she is now , I think she went through a remarkable journey and did more than just growing up , she finally became ' all whole and healed ' . " Maura O'Malley of '' Bustle '' also lauded the development of the character ahead of season 12 saying , " When the series began , Meredith was just a girl sitting in a bar celebrating the exciting next phase of her life . She had graduated medical school , she was starting her residency at a prestigious hospital , and she was simply looking for a no-strings attached , one night stand . What she got instead was a complicated romantic relationship that rivals Romeo and Juliet — but the key is , she was n't searching for love . Working and learning were — and continue to be — her priorities , while McDreamy was simply an added perk . Hopefully , the new season of Grey 's Anatomy will reflect this change in tone , because Meredith is a strong , independent woman — and she will be just fine . " Later in the series , Ellen Pompeo received critical acclaim with numerous critics lauding her portrayal of the character . Reviewing the episode She 's Leaving Home '' CarterMatt '' called her the " anchor " for Grey 's saying , " Throughout , this was an episode completely anchored by Ellen Pompeo , who has done some of her best work ever on the show the past couple of weeks . Tonight , she cried , she fought , and she learned that she was carrying his child . " and added that Pompeo is often " ovelooked " saying , " Her subtlety is probably why she is often overlooked . " Rick Porter of '' Zap2it '' reviewing " How to Save a Life " wrote , " Without Meredith , and without one of Pompeo 's strongest performances in her long time on the show , " How to Save a Life " would have run the risk of coming across as a baldly manipulative death episode , the likes of which the show has done several times before . He added . " How to Save a Life " may not be the ideal Emmy-submission episode for Pompeo , considering Meredith is off screen for more than half of it . But it 's among the best work she 's ever done on the show . " '' USA Today '' also lauded Pompeo saying , " In some ways , the episode ( How to Save a Life ) was even more of a showcase for Pompeo . She had some of the more memorable and well-played scenes , from her angry response to the doctor who tries to tell her what her choices are , to her resignation when she realizes she has to comfort and motivate the young doctor whose mistakes cost Derek his life . " The relation between Meredith and Cristina has been acclaimed and been a highlight of the show . Mark Perigard of the Boston Herald considered the friendship to be " the secret core of Grey 's " . Aisha Harris of '' Slate '' called their relation '' The Best Female Friendship on TV '' adding that " With those two characters , showrunner Shonda Rhimes and her team of writers created one of the most nuanced and realistic portrayals of female friendship on television . " Samantha Highfill of '' Entertainment Weekly '' called Cristina and Meredith the best female friends on TV because " they do n't try to be " . There 's nothing fake about them , which is a rarity in how female friends are portrayed on television . She further went on to call them ' soulmates ' , " And even though they 'd never dare get sappy enough to say it , they 're soul mates . Margaret Lyons of Vulture ( magazine ) called the friendship " dream BFF relationship . " and the primary focus of the show , " One of the series ' calling cards has been its depiction of female friendship and particularly the primacy that friendship enjoyed over romantic relationships . " '' E! '' at the time of Sandra Oh 's exit wrote , " In Grey 's Anatomy 's 10-year history , the doctor duo has been through a lot together : weddings , deaths , plane crashes , bomb threats , shooting , you name it , they 've lived ( and danced ) through it . " and added , " And with the three words , ' Y '' ou 're my person . '' ' Cristina Yang and Meredith Grey solidified their status as the small screen 's best best friends ever . " Marama Whyte of '' Hypable '' wrote , " Critically , the key relationship in Meredith 's life was not her romance with Derek Shepherd , but her passionate , indestructible , absolutely enviable friendship with Cristina . Talk about relationship goals ; who wants McDreamy when Cristina Yang could be your person . These two were the real powerhouse , and Shonda Rhimes did n't shy away from making the audience remember this . Derek was the love of her life , but Cristina was her soul mate . More than anyone else , Cristina challenged Meredith , was honest with her and inspired her . For these reasons , it was Cristina who was constantly the source of Meredith 's character development , not Derek . " Pompeo 's character has also been used to define the image a strong woman , '' Bustle '' previewing the 12th season wrote , " Meredith Grey has always been capable of being on her own . Grey 's Anatomy is about Meredith 's journey . Men and romantic interests are a part of her life , but they are not the priority . She does n't need McDreamy . Grey 's Anatomy does n't need McDreamy . So even if the writers do decide to create a new love interest for Ms. Grey ( Martin Henderson , perhaps ? ) , it would n't matter . I have faith that the show 's writers will do this storyline justice , because TV needs more strong single women — and Meredith seems like the perfect candidate . " The site added , " This past season was almost a trial run for a McDreamy-less Grey 's Anatomy . When Derek left for Washington D.C. to pursue his research , Meredith stayed behind and focused on her own career . She did n't chase him . Her priority were her children and the Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital . Meredith showed that she would never put aside her own dreams and aspirations for a man , and I believe that this wo n't change after Derek 's death . " Pompeo has won and has been nominated for multiple awards for her portrayal of Grey . She and the '' Grey 's Anatomy '' cast won Best Ensemble in a Television Series at the 2006 Satellite Awards . During the following year 's ceremony , she was named Best Actress in a Television Drama Series . She was among the '' Grey 's Anatomy '' cast members awarded the Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series accolade at the 13th Screen Actors Guild Awards , and received nominations in the same category in 2006 and 2008 . Pompeo received a Best Performance by an Actress in a Drama Series nomination at the 64th Golden Globe Awards – the program won Best Drama Series at the same ceremony . Also in 2007 , Pompeo and the female cast and crew of '' Grey 's Anatomy '' received the Women in Film Lucy Award , which honors those " whose work in television has positively influenced attitudes toward women . " Pompeo 's performance has garnered her multiple People 's Choice Awards . At the 37th People 's Choice Awards , she was nominated against Dempsey and Oh in the Favorite TV Doctor category , and the following year , she was a contender in the Favorite TV Drama Actress category . Since 2012 , Pompeo has received a nomination at the People 's Choice Awards every year in two categories at 40th People 's Choice Awards alongside Patrick Dempsey and Sandra Oh respectively . She won the Best Drama Actress Award at both the 39th People 's Choice Awards and the 41st People 's Choice Awards . In 2007 , show-business awards reporter Tom O'Neil commented that Pompeo was overdue an Emmy Award nomination for her role in '' Grey 's Anatomy '' . Readers of O'Neil 's awards website , '' The Envelope '' , included Pompeo in their 2009 nominations for Best Drama Actress in the site 's Gold Derby TV Awards . '' Entertainment Weekly '' launched the EWwy Awards in 2008 , to honor actors who have not received Emmy nominations .

" Sava noted that while the episode was humorous , much of the comedy was undercut by the tragic and distressing nature of Finn 's story . Andrew Tran of Overmental argued that " the episode ... dissects vividly that bottomless feeling of midlife wanderlust ... not the road-trippy , running-through-the-fields kind but rather the life-map-disappearing-in-your-hands , what-the-hell-is-next kind . " Tran contended that , through the use of video game tropes , explores the idea that life is ultimately unpredictable that there " is no map that you can make for yourself ( or that anyone can give you ) that can account for everything you ’re going to encounter " . " The Hall of Egress " has been highly lauded by the show 's production staff , with series creator Pendleton Ward in particular naming it as one of his favorites .

It was believed over the offseason , the Suns would be able to better incorporate Shaquille O'Neal , who necessitated changes to both the offense and defense after being obtained in a trade one season ago . It was also the first season head coach Terry Porter had been able to use the summer to implement his defensive approach for a team which had in seasons past scored a large number of their points off fast breaks and early in the shot clock . Sensing a need for change , team management traded for scorer Jason Richardson in December , but this did not appear to immediately reinvigorate an offense that had recently led the league in points per game . However , after Phoenix went 28 – 23 to start the season , Suns assistant Alvin Gentry was named to replace Porter as head coach . Less than one week after the All - Star Game , Amar ' e Stoudemire sustained a season - ending eye injury while the improvement of the team never fully came .

		CONTEXT=Wall Street and the Financial Crisis : Anatomy of a Financial Collapse is a report on the financial crisis of 2007 – 2008 issued on April 13 , 2011 by the United States Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations . The 639 - page report was issued under the chairmanship of Senators Carl Levin and Tom Coburn , and is colloquially known as the Levin - Coburn Report . After conducting " over 150 interviews and depositions , consulting with dozens of government , academic , and private sector experts " found that " the crisis was not a natural disaster , but the result of high risk , complex financial products , undisclosed conflicts of interest ; and the failure of regulators , the credit rating agencies , and the market itself to rein in the excesses of Wall Street . " In an interview , Senator Levin noted that " The overwhelming evidence is that those institutions deceived their clients and deceived the public , and they were aided and abetted by deferential regulators and credit ratings agencies who had conflicts of interest . " By the end of their two - year investigation , the staff amassed 56 million pages of memos , documents , prospectuses and e-mails . The report , which contains 2,800 footnotes and references thousands of internal documents focused on four major areas of concern regarding the failure of the financial system : high risk mortgage lending , failure of regulators to stop such practices , inflated credit ratings , and abuses of the system by investment banks . The Report also issued several recommendations for future action regarding each of these categories .

Later , in September 2014 , Spears posted a picture of herself in the studio , hinting that she was recording new music . In another interview , a month later , she revealed that she was working " very slowly , but progressively " on the album . In 2015 , she released the song " Pretty Girls " with Iggy Azalea , however the song was met with moderate impact and Spears headed back to the studio to record more songs , but did n't have plans to release a new album . In November 2015 , Spears teased on her Instagram account that she was working with songwriters Justin Tranter and Julia Michaels , by posting a picture of them looking " bemused " with the caption : " Working hard and hardly working ... new album ... wheeeee ! . " A month later , Tranter gave an interview for website NewNowNext about his work with Spears and commented : " Working with Britney is a fucking dream . She is so sweet , so inspiring and a master on the mic . Me and Julia had to leave the studio one day because our screams of excitement after every take she did were distracting the producers . " In late 2016 , during interviews to promote the album , Spears declared that she wanted to explore new things on the record , and that it was her " most hip-hop album , " explaining : " ... there are like two or three songs that go in the direction of more urban that I 've wanted to do for a long time now , and I just have n't really done that .

It was recorded at 158 Studios , Westlake Village , California , The Studio at the Palms , Las Vegas , Nevada , and at Wolf Cousins Studios , Stockholm , Sweden . " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is an electropop , and dance-pop song that lasts for three minutes and twenty-two seconds ( 3:22 ) . It features " subtle keyboards , a strummed guitar , " and " wobbly bass " in its instrumentation . For Brian Josephs of '' Spin '' , the song 's guitar slaps " recall her 2001 single ' I 'm a Slave 4 U.

" is a flirty song about Spears " offer ing several reasons why her lover should come over and options , which can be seen in the lines " Nobody should be alone if they do n't have to be " and " I could get into that kissin ' and touchin ' / Or we could be good and do next to nothin ' . " Amy Roberts of '' Bustle '' noted that the lyrics are about hooking up , adding that they " celebrate the idea that casual relationships do n't need to be lacking respect or understanding . You do n't have to be in love with , or committing to , the person that you 're hooking up with , but that also does n't mean that you ca n't connect with them on a different level than just sex . In fact , Spears makes it clear that it 's kind of even cool if her hook-up does n't want to have sex . Her partner can draw the boundaries of where the massage she 's offering starts and ends , and if it remains as nothing more than a back rub then so be it – that 's totally cool . " For Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine , the song features " some dubious lyrics that seem to suggest masturbatory self-love " in the lines : " All I want is what you want/And all you want is me . " The chorus of the song features " a shouted gang " of backup singers , singing : " Whatever you want / whatever you need / I 'll do it ! . " Lewis Corner of Digital Spy called it " a thumping pop anthem , " praising " Britney 's seductive vocal delivery . " Gil Kaufman of '' Billboard '' named it a " fun , flirty " track .

		CONTEXT=Oliver Sava of '' The A.V. Club '' awarded the episode an " A " , calling it " a fascinating psychological horror story about a boy shedding everything that defines him in order to move on to the next phase of his life . " Sava noted that while the episode was humorous , much of the comedy was undercut by the tragic and distressing nature of Finn 's story . Andrew Tran of Overmental argued that " the episode ... dissects vividly that bottomless feeling of midlife wanderlust ... not the road-trippy , running-through-the-fields kind but rather the life-map-disappearing-in-your-hands , what-the-hell-is-next kind . " Tran contended that , through the use of video game tropes , explores the idea that life is ultimately unpredictable that there " is no map that you can make for yourself ( or that anyone can give you ) that can account for everything you ’re going to encounter " . " The Hall of Egress " has been highly lauded by the show 's production staff , with series creator Pendleton Ward in particular naming it as one of his favorites . According to the crew , " It was just so thoughtfully done . " At the 68th Primetime Emmy Awards in 2016 , " The Hall of Egress " was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Short-format Animation .

		GOLD_MENTION=68th Primetime Emmy Awards
		CONTEXT=Oliver Sava of '' The A.V. Club '' awarded the episode an " A " , calling it " a fascinating psychological horror story about a boy shedding everything that defines him in order to move on to the next phase of his life . " Sava noted that while the episode was humorous , much of the comedy was undercut by the tragic and distressing nature of Finn 's story . Andrew Tran of Overmental argued that " the episode ... dissects vividly that bottomless feeling of midlife wanderlust ... not the road-trippy , running-through-the-fields kind but rather the life-map-disappearing-in-your-hands , what-the-hell-is-next kind . " Tran contended that , through the use of video game tropes , explores the idea that life is ultimately unpredictable that there " is no map that you can make for yourself ( or that anyone can give you ) that can account for everything you ’re going to encounter " . " The Hall of Egress " has been highly lauded by the show 's production staff , with series creator Pendleton Ward in particular naming it as one of his favorites . According to the crew , " It was just so thoughtfully done . " At the 68th Primetime Emmy Awards in 2016 , " The Hall of Egress " was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Short-format Animation . The episode lost to the '' Robot Chicken '' episode " Robot Chicken Christmas Special : The X-Mas United "

A good month later , one of my main camera guys was following Yachty around during his SXSW run and I came about during the conversation . We exchanged numbers and I saw he was in LA , so I called him and he answered on the first fucking ring . He came to the studio and we had the loop of this going . We were n’t sure on what was going to make it carry over . At first , it was the piano with the drum loop , we had the flute and when that went in , everyone started vibing . Yachty started on his verse and I did n’t have any bars at first so I told him to go in . When he left , I did n’t even have my verse , I just had the bridge . " James Grebey of '' Spin '' said " the pair ’s affable , clever rapping is a delight over the beat , which switched from a grizzled boom to some flighty , '' Kirby ’s Dreamland - '' esque twinkling . " Pitchfork 's Marcus J. Moore opined , " D.R.A.M. comes through with his usually energetic rhymes , proclaiming his territory while giving the track even more punch .

		CONTEXT=On August 17 , 2015 , Michel ' le , Dr. Dres former girlfriend and mother of one of his children , did an exclusive interview with Vlad TV . In the interview , the former Ruthless and Death Row Records artist ponders her and Dre 's abusive relationship and she states that she was aware she was not included in the '' Straight Outta Compton '' film . " Why would Dre put me in it ? I mean 'cause if they start from where they start from I was just a quiet girlfriend who got beat up and told to shut up . " On August 18 , 2015 , Gawker published an editorial by Dee Barnes titled " Here 's What 's Missing From Straight Outta Compton : Me and the Other Women Dr. Dre Beat Up " . Barnes notes that Dr. Dre had repeated instances of physical abuse to female associates during his time in N.W.A , to include the infamous January 1991 beating of Barnes in the bathroom of Po Na Na Souk nightclub . In the film , the incidents were never acknowledged . She further notes that important women from the era with close and historically important ties to N.W.A ( JJ Fad , Yo Yo , Tairrie B , etc. ) were absent from the film . In the end , most women portrayed in the film are partying groupies , with Barnes feeling that it could have also acknowledged the female MCs who contributed to N.W.A 's and/or individual members ' success . Gerrick D. Kennedy of the '' Los Angeles Times '' revealed the Barnes incident was originally included in an earlier version of the film 's script . On August 21 , 2015 , Dr. Dre responded , apologizing to " the women I ’ve hurt . I deeply regret what I did and know that it has forever impacted all of our lives . " The next day , Apple Inc. , which bought Beats Electronics for $ 3 billion in 2014 from Dr. Dre and made him an executive , weighed in on the abuse allegations to offer their support to Dre . Apple said in a statement , " Dre has apologized for the mistakes he 's made in the past and he 's said that he 's not the same person that he was 25 years ago . " On August 26 , 2015 , Randall Roberts of the '' Los Angeles Times '' criticized the film for leaving out the story of the all female rap group J. J.

" Similarly , Jake Cole of '' Slant Magazine '' praised the acting , but criticized the screenplay , and argued that " so much of the film feels old-hat . " In a review for '' The Verge '' , Tasha Robinson lamented the plot details omitted between the film 's three acts , but wrote that " what does make it to the screen is unforgettable . " While discussing the film after its screening at the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival , Justin Chang of the '' Los Angeles Times '' described '' Moonlight '' as " achingly romantic and uncommonly wise , " opining the film to be an early Oscar contender . Chang further wrote : " Barry Jenkins made a film that urges the viewer to look past Chiron 's outward appearance and his superficial signifiers of identity , climbing inside familiar stereotypes in order to quietly dismantle them from within ... '' Moonlight '' does n't say much . It says everything . " Writing for '' The London Review of Books '' in February 2017 , Michael Wood characterized the film as a study of an inherited intergenerational tragedy : Camilla Long of '' The Times '' wrote that the film 's " story has been told countless times , against countless backdrops " , and that the film is not " relevant " to a predominantly " straight , white , middle class " audience . Long was criticized by users on Twitter for the review , and was accused of being homophobic and racist in her writing .

		CONTEXT=After the commercial lackluster of her eighth studio album , '' Britney Jean '' ( 2013 ) , Spears started her Las Vegas residency show , Britney : Piece of Me , which attained commercial success . Later , in September 2014 , Spears posted a picture of herself in the studio , hinting that she was recording new music . In another interview , a month later , she revealed that she was working " very slowly , but progressively " on the album . In 2015 , she released the song " Pretty Girls " with Iggy Azalea , however the song was met with moderate impact and Spears headed back to the studio to record more songs , but did n't have plans to release a new album . In November 2015 , Spears teased on her Instagram account that she was working with songwriters Justin Tranter and Julia Michaels , by posting a picture of them looking " bemused " with the caption : " Working hard and hardly working ... new album ... wheeeee ! . " A month later , Tranter gave an interview for website NewNowNext about his work with Spears and commented : " Working with Britney is a fucking dream . She is so sweet , so inspiring and a master on the mic . Me and Julia had to leave the studio one day because our screams of excitement after every take she did were distracting the producers . " In late 2016 , during interviews to promote the album , Spears declared that she wanted to explore new things on the record , and that it was her " most hip-hop album , " explaining : " ... there are like two or three songs that go in the direction of more urban that I 've wanted to do for a long time now , and I just have n't really done that . " In May 2016 , in an exclusive interview for website '' Breathe Heavy '' , Tranter revealed : " Nobody ever talks about Britney as a writer and she ’s f " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " was written by Mattias Larsson , Robin Fredriksson , Julia Michaels , Justin Tranter and Sandy Chila , with production being done by Mattman & Robin . Mattman & Robin were also responsible for programming , drums , percussion , snaps , handclaps , synths , guitars , bass and kalimba , while Michaels and Jermaine Jackson provided background vocals . It was recorded at 158 Studios , Westlake Village , California , The Studio at the Palms , Las Vegas , Nevada , and at Wolf Cousins Studios , Stockholm , Sweden . " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is an electropop , and dance-pop song that lasts for three minutes and twenty-two seconds ( 3:22 ) . It features " subtle keyboards , a strummed guitar , " and " wobbly bass " in its instrumentation . For Brian Josephs of '' Spin '' , the song 's guitar slaps " recall her 2001 single ' I 'm a Slave 4 U. ' " Other critics also felt that the " strummed flamenco guitar " on the song is similar to those on Justin Timberlake 's " Like I Love You " . Bianca Gracie of '' Fuse '' opined that the song reminded her of " the glory days ( no pun intended ) of ' Circus ' and ' Femme Fatale ' . " Lyrically , " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is a flirty song about Spears " offer ing several reasons why her lover should come over and options , which can be seen in the lines " Nobody should be alone if they do n't have to be " and " I could get into that kissin ' and touchin ' / Or we could be good and do next to nothin ' . " Amy Roberts of '' Bustle '' noted that the lyrics are about hooking up , adding that they " celebrate the idea that casual relationships do n't need to be lacking respect or understanding . You do n't have to be in love with , or committing to , the person that you 're hooking up with , but that also does n't mean that you ca n't connect with them on a different level than just sex . In fact , Spears makes it clear that it 's kind of even cool if her hook-up does n't want to have sex . Her partner can draw the boundaries of where the massage she 's offering starts and ends , and if it remains as nothing more than a back rub then so be it – that 's totally cool . " For Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine , the song features " some dubious lyrics that seem to suggest masturbatory self-love " in the lines : " All I want is what you want/And all you want is me . " The chorus of the song features " a shouted gang " of backup singers , singing : " Whatever you want / whatever you need / I 'll do it ! . " Lewis Corner of Digital Spy called it " a thumping pop anthem , " praising " Britney 's seductive vocal delivery . " Gil Kaufman of '' Billboard '' named it a " fun , flirty " track . Bianca Gracie of '' Fuse '' described it as a " pulsating track that is a flirty booty call that is bound to own the dance floor . " Robbie Daw of Idolator found it to be " a traditional Spears-style chunk of dance-pop " and " arguably the best yet , with its thick whomping bass and that sparkling ' nobody should be alone if they do n't have to be ' breakdown . " Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine called it " impeccably produced downstairs music , " adding that it " is an irresistible slice of dance-pop , with an ebullient bassline and staccato acoustic guitar . " Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic declared that " some of the highlights on the album are the silliest songs , " citing " Do You Wan na Come Over " 's " overheated flamenco chorus " as an example . Maura Johnston of '' Boston Globe '' said the song was one of the album 's high points , noting that the song " is jolted to life by the slashed guitars that helped make ' Toxic ' a pop thrill . " John Murphy of musicOMH was positive while noting that the track " has a rush and urgency about it which marks it out as one of the album 's best songs . " Nolan Feeney of '' Entertainment Weekly '' also picked it as a highlight , praising the " acoustic guitars and gurgling bass lines that make for one freaky pop experiment . " Alex Macpherson of '' The Guardian '' wrote that the song " takes the party back to Britney 's heyday , " praising the inclusion of the flamenco guitar . For '' Los Angeles Times '' writer Mikael Wood , the song " restore s some of the sonic invention that once defined Spears ' biggest hits . " Nick Levine , writing for '' NME '' , echoed the same thought , writing : " The lusty strut of ‘ Do You Wan na Come Over ? ’ nods to her early-noughties Neptunes-produced hits . " In his Vice column , Robert Christgau selected " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " and " Clumsy " as his favorite tracks on the album . Amy Mackelden of '' Bustle '' elaborated about the track : With a strong '90s vibe , an upbeat tempo , and a surprising rhythm , " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " utilizes the best of Spears ' talents . ... " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " embraces the current trend for songs that are musically complicated , that layer up their beats and sound effects , and feature multiple voices and infectious shouting during their choruses . Much like Hailee Steinfeld and Gwen Stefani 's latest offerings , " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is melodic , has a fast tempo , and is instantly recognizable . And most importantly , it 's fun . On August 18 , 2016 , Spears added " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " , as well as " Make Me ... " , to the setlist of her Las Vegas residency show Britney : Piece of Me . Later , on September 1 , 2016 , a performance of the song was broadcast from Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas for Today . During the performance , she used " an outfit similar to her risqué costume from 2016 's VMAs , while her backup dancers stood out in brightly-colored tank tops and shorts , " as reported by '' Entertainment Weekly '' Ruth Kinane . The song was also included in Spears 's setlist for the iHeartRadio Music Festival on September 24 , 2016 . Spears also performed it at I Heart Radio Jingle Ball , Triple Show and B26 Pepsi Jingle Bash during December 2016 . Also performed it at Apple Music Festival which was held in United Kingdom

		CONTEXT=Its emphasis on transgressive themes has made a few industrial metal groups vulnerable to attack from American social conservatives . For example , Sen. Bob Dole , then head of the Republican Party , sharply criticized Time Warner after a meeting between Michael J. Fuchs ( head of the Warner Music Group ) , William Bennett , and C. Delores Tucker , at which Tucker and Bennett demanded that Fuchs read lyrics from NIN 's " Big Man with a Gun " . A year later , Bennett , Tucker , and Joseph Lieberman launched a similar campaign against MCA Records for their distribution of Marilyn Manson 's music . Many of his concerts were cancelled by authorities after this uproar . In addition , Dennis Cooper cited Ministry 's video for " Just One Fix " , which featured footage of William S. Burroughs , as an early example of heroin chic . Some initial reports claimed that Columbine High School shooters Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold were Marilyn Manson fans . In fact , they preferred KMFDM and Rammstein . Asa Coon , another school shooter , was a Manson fan . Manson , a former journalist , published a detailed response to the controversy following the Columbine shootings in an article published in '' Rolling Stone '' . It concluded : Sascha Konietzko reported that KMFDM was " sick and appalled " by the shootings , issuing a statement the following day saying : Rammstein stated that they " have no lyrical content or political beliefs that could have possibly influenced such behavior " . Rammstein have also been controversial for their use of Nazi imagery , including footage shot by Leni Riefenstahl for '' Olympia '' in their video for " Stripped " . Alec Empire , a German digital hardcore musician , declared that " Rammstein is successful for all the wrong reasons . I think they 're not a fascist band at all , but I think in Germany there 's a lot of misunderstanding and that 's why they sell records and I think that 's dangerous . " In response to the controversy , Rammstein stated that " We are not Nazis , Neo-Nazis , or any other kind of Nazi . We are against racism , bigotry or any other type of discrimination . " The band went on to create the song " Links 2-3-4 " , released in 2001 , which responded to the Nazi allegations by insinuating that they reside left on the political spectrum

Club '' awarded the episode an " A " , calling it " a fascinating psychological horror story about a boy shedding everything that defines him in order to move on to the next phase of his life . " Sava noted that while the episode was humorous , much of the comedy was undercut by the tragic and distressing nature of Finn 's story . Andrew Tran of Overmental argued that " the episode ... dissects vividly that bottomless feeling of midlife wanderlust ... not the road-trippy , running-through-the-fields kind but rather the life-map-disappearing-in-your-hands , what-the-hell-is-next kind . " Tran contended that , through the use of video game tropes , explores the idea that life is ultimately unpredictable that there " is no map that you can make for yourself ( or that anyone can give you ) that can account for everything you ’re going to encounter " . " The Hall of Egress " has been highly lauded by the show 's production staff , with series creator Pendleton Ward in particular naming it as one of his favorites .

" Kitty Empire of '' NME '' commented on how Mystikal is able to deviate from the typical hip-hop clichés and deliver tracks that express different topics , singling out the post-9 / 11 track " Bouncin ' Back ( Bumpin ' Me Against the Wall ) " for providing real substance and found it " strangely compelling for a show of strength . " Nathan Rabin of '' The A.V.

" '' Vibe '' writer Shawn Edwards was critical of Mystikal 's delivery , complimenting it for being distinctive but lacking in lyrical creativity , saying that he " has the potential to be the ringmaster , but right now he seems content just clowning around . " In 2003 , the album received two nominations at the 45th Annual Grammy Awards for Best Rap Album and Best Male Rap Solo Performance for " Boucin ' Back ( Bumpin ' Me Against the Wall ) " but lost both awards to Eminem 's '' The Eminem Show '' and Nelly 's " Hot in Herre " respectively .

" He also compared it to Marvin Gaye in concert , writing that " I saw Marvin Gaye at this venue shortly before he was murdered , and it was no contest .

		GOLD_MENTION=deported along with the entire Ingush civilian population
		CONTEXT=Abadiyev was born over a decade before the October Revolution in the Ingush village of Nasyr-Kort . Having been born during the Russo-Japanese War , he was named " Yaponts " , ( meaning Japanese ) due to the Ingush tradition of sometimes naming children with the ethnonyms of the peoples they fought in battle . After entering the Red Army in 1924 he was sent to cavalry school , where cadets participated in the liquidation of the kulaks . In 1930 he graduated from cavalry school and was stationed in the city of Vladikavkaz as a squadron commander . That year he was presented with an engraved Gewehr 98 , after recommendation of the commander of the 28th Rifle Division , A. D. Kazitsky . He became a member of the Communist Party in 1938 , in March 1939 he was appointed as the Chief of Staff of the 39th Cavalry Regiment , and in 1940 he was promoted to the position of deputy commander of the 107th Cossack Cavalry Regiment based in Armavir . In the early days of Operation Barbarossa , Abadiyev was on the front lines of the Second World War . Initially he was deputy commander of the 117th Heavy Tank Regiment based in Smolensk , which was subjected to heavy bombardments . He went on to command the 126th Cavalry Regiment of the 28th Cavalry Division in Pavlohrad . On 16 August 1941 , General Rodion Malinovsky the commander of the 6th Army , tasked Abadiyev with leading an attack to push back enemy forces in the region of Sursk-Litovsk towards the Dnieper . On August 19 , his regiment was the first in the region to begin the attack . The cavalrymen destroyed two enemy companies and completely expelled enemy forces from the village . From August 20 to 23 , Abadiyev managed to organize the repulsion of a tank offensive . The regiment assumed the main fire , and thus ensured the safe exit of the division from the battlefield , ensuring the success of the operation . In October 1941 , he sustained a head injury but continued to remain in command of his regiment . On 5 November 1941 he was awarded the Order of the Red Banner for success in combat . In March 1942 he was appointed as the commander of the newly formed 255th Separate Chechen-Ingush Cavalry Regiment , but soon accepted a new position and was replaced by his chief of staff Movlid Visaitov in May . Abadiyev was briefly in command of the 297th Cavalry Regiment of the 115th Kabardian-Balkar Cavalry Division before he was sent to command the 278th Cavalry Regiment in July , which was within the same division . In July 1942 German troops broke through the southern part of the front , which resulted in the division engaging in defensive operations in the North Caucasus , Stalingrad , and in the heavy fighting between the Don and Volga rivers . Earlier that year in June the division had received orders to fight off the 4th German Tank Army near the village of Konstantinovsk ; in the following defensive operation , the division would lost more than half of its personnel . On the evening of July 29 , the division took their positions for a counterattack , but the German tanks attacked first , destroying the headquarters of Major-General Boris Pogrebov before the 115th division could launch their offensive . Nevertheless , Abadiyev and his cavalrymen fought to their last , and the German who troops broke through the defensive line did so in Tsimlyansk area , which was junctioned between the 91st and 157th Rifle Divisions . It was noted by the command of the 51st Army that the regimental commanders of the 115th Division acted bravely and showed resilience . During one engagement in the summer of 1942 , Abadiyev was seriously wounded and nearly killed , but his horse saved his life and carried him off the battlefield under heavy enemy fire . The 115th Division was disbanded in October 1942 while Abadiyev was in the hospital , after having lost over two-thirds of its personnel ; the survivors of unit were sent to anti-tank and reconnaissance units . After recovering from his injuries he attended the Frunze Military Academy and briefly taught at the Arzamas Higher Officer Staff School before being redeployed to the warfront . He participated in the Battle of Stalingrad and the fighting at the Khopyor River . For his actions in repelling attacks from German tanks he was nominated for the title Hero of the Soviet Union by Konstantin Rokossovsky , but he did not receive the title . On 23 February 1944 his family was deported along with the entire Ingush civilian population ; the Soviet government had labeled Vainakh peoples as " traitors to the motherland " and ordered the mass relocation of them to prison settlements in Central Asia . Yaponts Abadiyev was recalled from the front , but not immediately sent to a " special settlement " and was instead allowed to command a reserve regiment in Orenburg and then serve as deputy commander of the 28th Reserve Regiment in Bashkortostan . When the war officially ended he was stationed in Gorky as a battalion commander . After the war he was assigned to command construction battalions in Vladimir , Ryazan , Moscow , Berezniki , and Kuibyshev , before returning to Ingushetia in the early 1980s . He retired from the military in the 1950s with the rank of lieutenant-colonel . After his death in 1985 he was posthumously awarded the Order of Lenin , the medal of which was presented to his living relatives . There are memorial plaques bearing his name in Volgograd in a museum and Mamayev Kurgan

		ANSWER=two centimetres each year
		GOLD_MENTION=
		CONTEXT=The Kelvin – Helmholtz mechanism is an astronomical process that occurs when the surface of a star or a planet cools . The cooling causes the internal pressure to drop , and the star or planet shrinks as a result . This compression , in turn , heats the core of the star / planet . This mechanism is evident on Jupiter and Saturn and on brown dwarfs whose central temperatures are not high enough to undergo hydrogen fusion . It is estimated that Jupiter radiates more energy through this mechanism than it receives from the Sun , but Saturn might not . The latter process causes Jupiter to shrink at a rate of two centimetres each year . Nevertheless in the second edition of his book in 2009 , Patrick Irwin gives a shrinking of only 1 mm / year , a value corresponding to an internal flux of 7.485 W / m 2 ( a figure given by Liming Li et al. . ) , instead of 150 W / m 2 , corresponding to 2 cm / year , a clearly too high value .

SIM was postponed several times and finally cancelled in 2010 . In addition to detecting extrasolar planets , SIM would have helped astronomers construct a map of the Milky Way galaxy . Other important tasks would have included collecting data to help pinpoint stellar masses for specific types of stars , assisting in the determination of the spatial distribution of dark matter in the Milky Way and in the local group of galaxies and using the gravitational microlensing effect to measure the mass of stars .

		GOLD_MENTION=64th World Science Fiction Convention
		CONTEXT=In August , 2006 , at the 64th World Science Fiction Convention , in a give-and-take with her audience , Willis described her novel-in-progress : " It 's about World War 2 , and I have four historians ... One of them is with the evacuating children in the North of England ; one of them is doing the Blitz ; one of them is doing the civilian evacuation from Dunkirk , '' of '' soldiers but '' by '' civilians ; and one of them is doing the Intelligence War involved in the lead-up to D-Day , where they fooled Hitler into thinking we were attacking at Calais , instead of at Normandy . And their lives are hopelessly intertwined ; but then they all get in trouble &mdash; you know my books &mdash; they all get in terrible trouble and ca n't get out of it . And are stuck in World War II , for God 's sake ! So : Not a safe place to be . " ( An audience member called , " Better than the Plague ! " ) Willis laughed but replied , " Not necessarily better than the Plague ! In slightly better survival chance because they have the advantage of some knowledge that the locals do n't have , but then again , historical events are notoriously inaccurate , and just because you think you know where all the bombs fell , does n't mean you do . So that will figure heavily in the book ... I have a lot of stuff to tell you about the war ... The Brits were absolutely wonderful ... They '' were '' great and plucky and funny under pressure . " In a February 12 , 2010 interview Connie Willis said : What are '' Blackout '' and '' All Clear '' about ? They 're about Dunkirk and ration books and D-Day and V-1 rockets , about tube shelters and Bletchley Park and gas masks and stirrup pumps and Christmas pantomimes and cows and crossword puzzles and the deception campaign . And mostly the book 's about all the people who " did their bit " to save the world from Hitler &mdash; Shakespearean actors and ambulance drivers and vicars and landladies and nurses and WRENs and RAF pilots and Winston Churchill and General Patton and Agatha Christie &mdash; heroes all . Michael Dirda of '' The Washington Post '' praised the diptych as " as vivid an evocation of England during World War II as anyone has ever written " and wrote that " '' Blackout '' is , by turns , witty , suspenseful , harrowing and occasionally comic to the point of slapstick . " Adrienne Martini of Locus Online called the 1940s Britain that Willis created " richly textured " . A. M. Dellamonica described the story as " an intricate puzzle " and " a celebration , too , of courage and heroism , of perseverance , of ordinary people doing small things to aid in great causes , of devotion , friendship , keeping one 's word . It has funny characters and laugh out loud moments aplenty , but it is no wacky romp , this book , no '' To Say Nothing of the Dog '' . At the same time , I found it funnier and , strangely , cheerier than previous Willis novels with a comparable body count . " Thomas M. Wagner called '' Blackout '' " an absolute monster of an epic , a time-travel saga so rich in scope that it 's taking two volumes to tell , yet so intimate in its observation of character that what you take away from it are not thrilling action setpieces but those moments of bonding people share — warm , funny , confused , trivial , angry , heartfelt — that take on a new and infinitely greater meaning in the shadow of death ... Amid the growing suspense , Willis builds an engrossing work of humanist fiction that avoids pathos and easy sentiment in depicting the quiet practicality and occasional heroism ( and yes , the callousness ) of Londoners surviving the Blitz . Memorable characters abound , and Willis 's gift for natural dialogue brings scenes to life in a way that makes you feel you 're in their presence . And she never pulls the lame stunt of creating a character for you to love just to kill them as an exercise in cheap button mashing . We get to know every one of the people with whom Polly shares a shelter every night , like the blustery , avuncular stage actor Sir Godfrey Kingsman , who quotes the Bard every time he opens his mouth yet whose personality rings true all the same . Eileen finds herself saddled with two of the most ill-behaved children in history , and yet you kind of like them , especially because , as a sort of brother-and-sister demolition duo with an appallingly indifferent and irresponsible mother , you realize they 've only ever had each other . " Julie Phillips of '' The Village Voice '' wrote , " '' Blackout/All Clear '' is neither tragedy nor comedy , but a mystery story with touches of grief and slapstick ... None of the three historians manages to stand by and observe ... The cast of characters is long , but Willis convinces you to care about almost all their fates — and to surprise you about their connection to each other . Willis 's evocation of wartime London sometimes feels romanticized , and it has few moral or demographic complications ... Nor is Willis 's theme , the heroism of ordinary people , especially original . But by the time the three historians and Mr. Dunworthy have unraveled the mystery and arrived at the full-on , three-hanky finale , you 'll no longer be a disinterested observer . " Some reviewers complained of the length of the books and their narrative modes . Christopher DeFilippis , writing for the SF Site , said he thought the books " can best be described by words like ' belabored ' and ' exasperating . ' That 's because the single story told in '' Blackout '' and '' All Clear '' did n't have to encompass two novels . Had it not been marred by endlessly repetitive prose and character actions , the narrative could have fit neatly into a single volume ... Unfortunately , the bulk of '' Blackout '' is taken up by Polly , Mike and Eileen 's individual realizations that they 're trapped in the past , with each caught in a state of seemingly perpetual denial about their circumstances . Instead of acknowledging the blatant truth of their predicament , they concoct endless mental scenarios as to why their gates wo n't open ... Willis goes on for pages with her protagonists repeatedly ruminating about the same " what ifs " over and over ( and over ) again . It may be understandable in the beginning of the story as the characters adjust to the magnitude of their situation . But it soon becomes apparent that this is what constitutes drama in Willis ' universe and it never stops ... It 's a shame that these negatives so overwhelm '' Blackout '' and '' All Clear '' , because despite them the books feature many terrific characters moving in extremely interesting historical situations . " Similarly , Adam Roberts of '' The Guardian '' wrote , " The result is a mildly interesting 200-page novel about the ordinary heroism of British civilians during the war , bloated to 800 pages via an egregiously handled time-travel conceit , eked out with great jellied quantities of historical research , endless meandering conversations , long passages disposed into that tiresome typographical convention by which characters ' inmost thoughts are spelled out in italics , and a string of inconsequential chapter-end cliffhangers/immediate resolutions that got increasingly on my nerves as the book went on . There 's little overall tension , and the time-travelling historians come over as both panicky and amateurish – an undesirable combination , one might think , where timelines are lying about ready to be mucked up . " He added , though , " The aim is a commendable one . Despite walk-on parts by General Patton , Agatha Christie and Alan Turing , the bulk of the characters in '' All Clear '' are ordinary people getting on with their ordinary lives ... And it ca n't be denied that the subject here , the heroism of ordinary people in testing times , is worthy and honourable . "

		CONTEXT=On February 19 – 20 , 1884 , one of the largest and most widespread tornado outbreaks in American history occurred over the Southeastern United States . The outbreak produced the largest 24 - hour total of killer tornadoes until the 1974 Super Outbreak on April 3 – 4 . The precise number of tornadoes as well as fatalities incurred during the outbreak is unknown , but the death toll was variously estimated to range from 370 – 2,000 at the time . A reliable survey by the Signal Corps in 1889 located 182 fatalities , and a reanalysis by tornado researcher Thomas P. Grazulis in 1993 counted 178 deaths . Nonetheless , an inspection of newspaper reports and governmental studies published in the aftermath reveals successive , long - tracked tornado families striking Alabama , Georgia , Illinois , Indiana , Kentucky , Mississippi , North Carolina , South Carolina , Tennessee and Virginia , with an estimation of at least 37 tornadoes . [ 10 ] [ 11 ] Some events counted as tornadoes in initial studies such as those by John Park Finley were likely downbursts , especially in northern and northeastern portions of the outbreak . [ 11 ]

For centuries , Japan viewed the Ryukyu Islands as one of its provinces . In 1871 the Mudan incident happened : cannibal Taiwanese aborigines murdered 54 Ryūkyūan sailors that had their ship shipwrecked . At that time the Ryukyu Islands were claimed by both Qing China and Japan , and the Japanese interpreted the incident as an attack on their citizens . They took steps to bring the islands in their jurisdiction : in 1872 the Japanese Ryukyu Domain was declared , and in 1874 a retaliatory incursion to Taiwan was sent , which was a success . The success of this expedition emboldened the Japanese : not even the Americans could defeat the Taiwanese cannibals in the Formosa Expedition of 1867 . Very few gave it much thought at the time , but this was the first move in the Japanese expansionism series . Japan occupied Taiwan for the rest of 1874 and then left owing to Chinese pressures , but in 1879 it finally annexed the Ryukyu Islands . In 1875 Qing China sent a 300-men force to subdue the Taiwanese cannibals , but unlike the Japanese the Chinese were routed , ambushed and 250 of their men were killed ; the failure of this expedition exposed once more the failure of Qing China to exert effective control in Taiwan , and acted as another incentive for the Japanese to annex Taiwan .

		CONTEXT=, also Disposition of the Ryūkyūs , dispositions relating to the Ryūkyūs , or Annexation of Okinawa , was the political process during the early years of the Meiji period that saw the incorporation of the former Ryūkyū Kingdom into the Empire of Japan as Okinawa Prefecture ( i.e. , one of Japan 's " home " prefectures ) and its decoupling from the Chinese tributary system . [ 10 ] These processes began with the creation of Ryūkyū Domain in 1872 and culminated in the kingdom 's annexation and final dissolution in 1879 ; immediate diplomatic fallout and consequent negotiations with Qing China , brokered by Ulysses S. Grant , effectively came to an end late the following year . [ 11 ] The term is also sometimes used more narrowly in relation to the events and changes of 1879 alone .

		CONTEXT=Sortes sanctorum was a late antique and early medieval practice of deciding by lots , but its exact meaning remains obscure . It was once believed to be identical with the practice of Sortes biblicae , biblical lot divination , whereby one would seek guidance by opening the Bible at random and consulting the verses therein . The confusion between the two practices has been noted in a study by William Klingshirn . The mistaken identification of Sortes sanctorum with Sortes biblicae seems to have originated with Edward Gibbon in the third volume of his Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire , published in 1781 . More recent studies hold that the practice consisted of writing names on lots , which were then cast as part of a decision - making process . Another , more radical hypothesis , argues that the expression Sortes sanctorum " referred neither to biblical lot divination nor to any genre of divination at all " . Rather , accoring to this hypothesis , " Sortes sanctorum " was simply the title of a specific text , which is still extant in a number of medieval manuscripts . The practice of Sortes sanctorum was condemned by two early church councils : Vannes ( AD 461 ) , canon 16 , and Agde ( AD 506 ) , canon 42 .

		CONTEXT=was a high - ranking Japanese official during the Nara period . He was born in Bizen Province ( now Wake , Okayama ) to a family of politically important , devoted Buddhists who hoped to keep Buddhism and politics separate through religious reform . He became a trusted advisor to Emperor Kanmu , a position which he used to encourage the development of Buddhism in a direction which would prevent it from posing a threat to the government . According to the Shoku Nihongi , he was sent to the Usa Shrine to receive a divine message ; stating that only those of descent from Amaterasu could become emperor , it refuted the previous divine message claiming Dōkyō was to be the next emperor after Empress Kōken ( later Empress Shōtoku ) . This report angered Dōkyō , who used his influence with the Empress to have an edict issued sending Kiyomaro into exile ; he also had the sinews of Kiyomaro 's legs cut , and only the protection of the Fujiwara clan saved him from being killed outright .

		GOLD_MENTION=Mudan incident
		CONTEXT=And Japan was eager to take every opportunity . In 1869 they took advantage of the defeat of the rebels of the Republic of Ezo to incorporate definitely the island of Hokkaido to Japan . For centuries , Japan viewed the Ryukyu Islands as one of its provinces . In 1871 the Mudan incident happened : cannibal Taiwanese aborigines murdered 54 Ryūkyūan sailors that had their ship shipwrecked . At that time the Ryukyu Islands were claimed by both Qing China and Japan , and the Japanese interpreted the incident as an attack on their citizens . They took steps to bring the islands in their jurisdiction : in 1872 the Japanese Ryukyu Domain was declared , and in 1874 a retaliatory incursion to Taiwan was sent , which was a success . The success of this expedition emboldened the Japanese : not even the Americans could defeat the Taiwanese cannibals in the Formosa Expedition of 1867 . Very few gave it much thought at the time , but this was the first move in the Japanese expansionism series . Japan occupied Taiwan for the rest of 1874 and then left owing to Chinese pressures , but in 1879 it finally annexed the Ryukyu Islands . In 1875 Qing China sent a 300-men force to subdue the Taiwanese cannibals , but unlike the Japanese the Chinese were routed , ambushed and 250 of their men were killed ; the failure of this expedition exposed once more the failure of Qing China to exert effective control in Taiwan , and acted as another incentive for the Japanese to annex Taiwan . Eventually , the spoils for winning the First Sino-Japanese War in 1894 included Taiwan

		CONTEXT=Shinjū ( 心中 , the characters for " mind " and " centre " ) means " double suicide " in Japanese , as in Shinjū Ten no Amijima ( The Love Suicides at Amijima ) , written by the seventeenth - century tragedian Chikamatsu Monzaemon for the puppet theatre ( bunraku and / or joruri theatre ) . In common parlance shinjū is used to refer to any group suicide of persons bound by love , typically lovers , parents and children , and even whole families . In Japanese theatre and literary tradition , double suicides are the simultaneous suicides of two lovers whose ninjo , ( personal feelings ) or love for one another are at odds with giri , social conventions or familial obligations . Double suicides were rather common in Japan throughout history and double suicide is an important theme of the puppet theatre repertory . The tragic denouement is usually known to the audience and is preceded by a michiyuki , a small poetical journey , where lovers evoke the happier moments of their lives and their attempts at loving each other .

		ANSWER=not the regret for the shooting down of both aircraft .
		GOLD_MENTION=second shooting down
		CONTEXT=The second shooting down , on 12 February 1979 , killed all 59 on board . The real target of the second attack was General Peter Walls , head of the COMOPS ( Commander , Combined Operations ) , in charge of the Special Forces , including the SAS and the Selous Scouts . Due to the large number of tourists returning to Salisbury a second flight had been dispatched . General Walls received a boarding card for the second flight , which departed Kariba 15 minutes after the doomed aircraft . No one has been brought to trial or charged with shooting down the aircraft due to amnesty laws passed by both Smith and Mugabe . In a television interview not long after the attack on the first aircraft , Nkomo joked about the incident while admitting ZAPU had indeed been responsible . In his memoirs , '' Story of My Life '' , published in 1985 , Nkomo later said , " during that interview , the interviewee had asked about what we used to down the planes and I said stones , jokingly in an attempt to avoid answering the question due to military intelligence which demanded secrecy regarding what type of weapons we had acquired from the Soviet Union . They remembered the laugh and not the regret for the shooting down of both aircraft . " Nkomo founded the National Democratic Party ( NDP ) and in 1960 , the year British prime minister Harold Macmillan spoke of the " Wind of Change " blowing through Africa , Robert Mugabe joined him . The NDP was banned by the white minority government and it was subsequently replaced by the Zimbabwe African Peoples Union ( ZAPU ) , also founded by Nkomo , in 1962 , itself immediately banned . ZAPU split in 1963 and while some have claimed this split was due to ethnic tensions , more accurately the split was motivated by the failure of Sithole , Mugabe , Takawira and Malianga to wrest control of ZAPU from Nkomo . ZAPU would remain a multi-ethnic party right up until independence

		CONTEXT=The film 's screenplay was written by television writer and producer John Sacret Young , who himself was a former hockey player . Prior to writing the screenplay , Young had been unsuccessfully working as a novelist in Vermont . Commenting on the setting , Young said : " Skating is filled with stories that are very intense - the romances , the hatreds . I do n't think that story 's ever been told . Skating is a loose fraternity . They share something , the early morning practice , the rigorous training . It 's like war veterans without the pall of death . " Young spent six months frequenting ice skating rinks in Colorado , and based many of the characters in the film real people he met there : " You go to any rink and 6 a.m. and here are these burly women in overcoats . They give their lives to this . " Young was partly inspired to write the film after the 1961 Sabena Flight 548 plane crash that killed the entire U.S. Figure Skating team

		CONTEXT=Trnopolje was described variously as a ghetto , a prison and a detention camp . A United Nations ( UN ) report from 1994 reported that Trnopolje was a concentration camp which functioned as a staging area for mass deportations mainly of women , children , and elderly men . The reported found that : Refugees reported that Trnopolje was a " decent " camp in comparison to Omarska and Keraterm as there were no systematic killings , only arbitrary ones . Indeed , many non-Serbs entered the camp voluntarily , " simply to avoid the rampaging militias plundering their streets and villages " . This phenomenon led British journalist Ed Vulliamy to describe Trnopolje as " a perverse haven " for the Bosniaks and Croats of Prijedor . Author Hariz Halilovich writes : Many inmates were starved and physically or verbally abused during their imprisonment . By August 1992 , Trnopolje held about 3,500 people . On 7 August 1992 , reporters from Independent Television News ( ITN ) , a British television station , took footage of the prisoners at Omarska and Trnopolje , and recorded their living conditions . The images were shown around the world and caused public outrage . This prompted the Bosnian Serb authorities to allow journalists and the International Red Cross ( IRC ) access to some of the Prijedor camps , but not before the most emaciated of the prisoners were killed or shipped off to camps far from the public eye . Some 200 former male inmates were separated and killed in the Korićani Cliffs massacre on 21 August 1992 . The publicity generated by the discovery of the Prijedor camps led to their closure by the end of August . In mid-August , Trnopolje was placed into the hands of the IRC . The camp was officially shut down that November

On May 27 , 2014 Cyrus performed the song during the World Music Awards held in Monte Carlo , Monaco ; where she also won four World Music Awards . She wore a gown with a scenic theme based on flowers during the performance . It received positive reviews for its understated simplicity and strong vocal delivery . Cyrus returned to perform the song during the musical festival on June 21 , 2014 , Summertime Ball at Wembley Stadium of London , in front of 80,000 people . Cyrus has performed the song during her ongoing Bangerz Tour . A critic from the '' Nashville Scene '' praised the performance , writing , " Wrecking Ball was sung by Miley and earnestly shouted in unison by the arena , some of the audience tearing up . " Blake Hannon praised Cyrus ' vocal delivery , writing , " The crowd kept going when things slowed down for Wrecking Ball . It was the highlight of the night , and not because of anything visual . The costumed characters vanished and the screen was black , with Cyrus belting out one of the best pop power ballads in recent memory with only a smattering of lights . It 's a reminder that beneath it all , Cyrus has a voice — and a pretty big one , at that . " In September 2013 , British singer-songwriter James Arthur covered " Wrecking Ball " on Radio Hamburg in Germany . Later that month , The Gregory Brothers released a country version , which Laura Vitto from Mashable felt " trades in Miley 's pop-ballad sound for a twangier feel . " American singer-songwriter Alonzo Holt released his own rendition in October , which featured vocals from Arthur ; it peaked at number 97 on the UK Singles Chart and number 71 on the Irish Singles Chart . Upstate New York alternative metal band Cry To The Blind released a cover of " Wrecking Ball " on December 11 , 2013 .

According to review aggregator Metacritic , the album has a score of 48/100 based on 8 reviews , indicating " mixed or average reviews " . On another aggregator website , Album of the Year , it holds the 4th position on a list of worst reviewed albums of 2014 . Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic gave the album 2.5 stars out of 5 saying that " Michele is not a natural pop star . This was true in 2009 when she debuted on '' Glee '' as Rachel Berry and it 's even clearer in 2014 . " Mike Ayers from '' Billboard '' gave a mostly positive review , saying , " Lyrically , '' Louder '' is rather one-sided , as she often sings about the perils of relationships , over and over , in ways that we 've all heard many times at this point . Still , it 's a solid effort that shows she has promise as a bonafide pop artist . " Sarah Rodman of '' The Boston Globe '' gave the album a mostly positive review , writing , " The Broadway veteran puts her mighty soprano through its paces on bouncy dance tracks , soaring ballads , and midtempo pop tunes where she straddles the line , mostly comfortably , between Katy Perry and Celine Dion . " Kyle Anderson of '' Entertainment Weekly '' gave the album a B - , writing , " It 's hard to be that mad at '' Louder '' , because it 's so admirably and lovingly crafted . There 's nothing wrong with Lea Michele 's debut , and that 's its biggest problem . While well curated and exquisitely executed , '' Louder '' is missing the visceral oomph that defines the gulf between superstars and the rest of the top 40 chum . " At '' USA Today '' , Jerry Shriver rated the album 2.5 stars out of four , and stated that " softer would have been a better approach . " He added that the song " Battlefield " points to a more promising direction . Kevin McFarland of '' The A.V. Club '' gave a C - rating , writing , " '' Louder '' , Michele 's debut solo album under her own name , does feature her distinctive talent as a vocalist . But the record is caught in an unfortunate stylistic limbo between fun-loving , youthful pop and the maturity of adult contemporary artists . " Jim Farber of the '' New York Daily News '' awarded the album two stars . He criticized , " Michele does n't so much sing as trumpet like an elephant eager for the charge . Her voice has more need than vulnerability , more anger than understanding . " Christopher R. Weingarten of '' Rolling Stone '' also gave a negative review , stating , " This album of insta-dated EDM-pop anthems and half-cocked bass drops probably wo n't help Michele 's cause . The songs about love 's ups and downs have a few memorable lyrics ( ' My heart 's too drunk to drive ' ) but not nearly enough . " '' Louder '' was nominated for World 's Best Album at the 2014 World Music Awards , held in Monaco on May 27 , 2014

		CONTEXT=Radio 2 Live in Hyde Park ( also known as Radio 2 's Festival in a Day ) is a British music festival that has taken place annually since 2011 in Hyde Park in London .

The festival is designed to appeal to the over 35 demographic that makes up the majority of BBC Radio 2 listeners , although the event attracts fans of all ages . The line - up is compiled of the various adult contemporary music and specialist genres featured on Radio 2 , including folk , country , soul , rock and jazz . The festival was hosted by Chris Evans and later Jo Whiley alongside other Radio 2 presenters and is broadcast live on the station and streamed on the BBC Red Button .

He notably expressed alarm that companies would profit from surging digital sales of Adolf Hitler 's book " Mein Kampf " . Singer told ABC News that " w hile the academic study of Mein Kampf is certainly legitimate , the spike in ebook sales likely comes from neo-Nazis and skinheads idolizing the greatest monster in history , " and added : " We think that responsible companies should n't profiteer from the sales of hate books , or at least should donate the profits to help the victims of anti-Semitism , racism and other like bigotries . " Following the 2014 Gaza conflict and a subsequent surge in anti-Semitic activity , Singer urged European governments to " strengthen police protection of Jewish sites and to ban or disband violent rallies . " He urged them to " stop the agitation and protect their Jewish populations , or Jews will ultimately turn their back on those countries . Jews live in Europe by right , not sufferance . " Addressing a pro-Israel rally in Stockholm , Sweden , on 31 August 2014 , Singer declared : “ Israel and its actions in Gaza are used as an excuse to besiege a synagogue in Paris , to shout ‘ Jews to the gas ’ on the streets of Berlin , or to attack people wearing a Jewish skullcap . None of this is acceptable , and it is high time that European leaders stand up against these expressions of antisemitism and take action . ” In September 2014 , it was announced that the World Jewish Congress would play a leading role in preparing the commemorative events in Auschwitz marking the 70th anniversary of the liberation of the notorious Nazi death camp , in January 2015 . In a press release , Singer said : " This will probably mark the last time that so many survivors will be able to join us at Auschwitz , and we must ensure that the unspeakable suffering they and many others had to endure at Auschwitz will not be forgotten once they are no longer among us . " Following the 2015 Copenhagen shootings , Singer traveled to Norway , Denmark , and Finland where he met with the leadership of Jewish communities as well as senior government officials

		CONTEXT=During a ceremony , sometimes a celebrity presenter or award winner might not know when they are going to be slimed onstage or offstage , though as the years went on , getting slimed became more of an honor , and less of the comedic humiliation of where the concept originated , with the early Nickelodeon series '' You Ca n't Do That on Television '' . Hosts of the show have also been slimed , especially in recent years , and occasionally celebrities not attending the awards have been slimed via video segment , such as when Rosie O'Donnell tricked Melissa Joan Hart into getting slimed on the set of '' Sabrina the Teenage Witch '' in 2001 , or when Amanda Seyfried and Josh Hutcherson were slimed at a KCA watch party in 2013 . Celebrities sitting in the audience are also fair game for being slimed , as Mandy Moore first learned in 2007 , and Halle Berry later found out in 2012 . Although Les Lye was the only celebrity to be slimed at the 1988 Awards , a video was shown during the show of then Nickelodeon president Geraldine Laybourne saying the magic words and getting slimed with the original '' YCDTOTV '' recipe , much to her dismay , proving that not even the network president was safe from the slime . Last but not least , in addition to the celebrity slimings in 1992 , the entire audience was slimed at the end of the show , which began a long running tradition known as '' The Final Slime '' , which is still in effect as of the 2019 Awards

		ANSWER=NBC 's commitment to '' Sunday Night Football
		GOLD_MENTION=Video Music Awards
		CONTEXT=The ceremony was held on a night other than Sunday for the first time since 1976 ( the 28th Primetime Emmy Awards were also staged on a Monday that year , May 17 ) . The ceremony 's unusual date — a Monday night in late August — was due to two factors , primary being NBC 's commitment to '' Sunday Night Football '' ; since acquiring the National Football League 's Sunday night game package in 2006 , NBC , when it is their turn in the four-network rotation to air the Primetime Emmy Awards , usually schedules the ceremony for the Sunday before Labor Day weekend , to avoid conflicts with '' SNF '' in mid-September ( when ABC , CBS , or Fox normally air the ceremony ) . NBC 's ideal date on the 2014 calendar for the ceremony ( Sunday , August 24 ) led to the other scheduling factor — MTV 's Video Music Awards , which were set for that night more than a year in advance ( and would be staged in the L.A. area as well , at The Forum in Inglewood ) . On January 28 , 2014 , rather than go head-to-head with the VMA 's , NBC announced that the ceremony would take place on Monday , August 25 . The move would allow NBC to commit to a preseason '' Sunday Night Football '' broadcast for the 24th ( a game between the Cincinnati Bengals and Arizona Cardinals ) ; it also ensured the tradition of staging the Primetime Emmy Awards the weekend after the Creative Arts Emmy Awards ( that ceremony was already set for August 16 )

		CONTEXT=Oliver Sava of '' The A.V. Club '' awarded the episode an " A " , calling it " a fascinating psychological horror story about a boy shedding everything that defines him in order to move on to the next phase of his life . " Sava noted that while the episode was humorous , much of the comedy was undercut by the tragic and distressing nature of Finn 's story . Andrew Tran of Overmental argued that " the episode ... dissects vividly that bottomless feeling of midlife wanderlust ... not the road-trippy , running-through-the-fields kind but rather the life-map-disappearing-in-your-hands , what-the-hell-is-next kind . " Tran contended that , through the use of video game tropes , explores the idea that life is ultimately unpredictable that there " is no map that you can make for yourself ( or that anyone can give you ) that can account for everything you ’re going to encounter " . " The Hall of Egress " has been highly lauded by the show 's production staff , with series creator Pendleton Ward in particular naming it as one of his favorites . According to the crew , " It was just so thoughtfully done . " At the 68th Primetime Emmy Awards in 2016 , " The Hall of Egress " was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Short-format Animation . The episode lost to the '' Robot Chicken '' episode " Robot Chicken Christmas Special : The X-Mas United "

		GOLD_MENTION=S7 Airlines Flight 778
		CONTEXT=Rasputin 's daughter Maria died in the 2006 crash of S7 Airlines Flight 778 , and his wife died six years later . He died in Moscow on 14 March 2015 , a day short of his 78th birthday . Patriarch Kirill of the Russian Orthodox Church conducted his funeral service , and President Vladimir Putin paid his respects . ( In 2014 Rasputin had co-signed a letter by writers in support of Putin 's annexation of the Crimea . ) Rasputin is closely associated with a movement in post-war Soviet literature known as " village prose , " or sometimes " rural prose " ( деревенская проза ) . Beginning in the time of the Khrushchev Thaw ( оттепель ) , village prose was praised for its stylistic and thematic departures from socialist realism . Village prose works usually focused on the hardships of the Soviet peasantry , espoused an idealized picture of traditional village life , and implicitly or explicitly criticized official modernization projects . Rasputin 's 1979 novel '' Farewell to Matyora '' , which depicts a fictional Siberian village which is to be evacuated and cleared so that a hydroelectric dam can be constructed further down the Angara River , was considered the epitome of this genre . The opening paragraph below is a good example of Rasputin 's writing style ( exceptional even for the village prose writers ) , and the novel 's theme of natural cycles disrupted by modernization : '' Once more spring had come , one more in the never-ending cycle , but for Matyora this spring would be the last , the last for both the island and the village that bore the same name . Once more , rumbling passionately , the ice broke , piling up mounds on the banks , and the liberated Angara River opened up , stretching out into a mighty , sparkling flow . Once more the water gushed boisterously at the island ’s upper tip , before cascading down both channels of the riverbed ; once more greenery flared on the ground and in the greens , the first rains soaked the earth , the swifts and swallows flew back , and at dusk in the bogs the awakened frogs croaked their love of life . It had all happened many times before . '' ( From Rasputin 's novel '' Farewell to Matyora '' , translated by Antonina W. Bouis , 1979 ) Rasputin 's nonfiction works contain similar themes , often in support of relevant political causes . He directed particularly trenchant criticism at large-scale dam building , like the project that flooded his own hometown , and water management projects , like the diversion of the Siberian rivers to Central Asia . He argued that these projects were destructive not simply in an ecological sense , but in a moral sense as well

		ANSWER=Rasputin 's daughter Maria died in the 2006 crash of S7 Airlines Flight 778
		GOLD_MENTION=S7 Airlines Flight 778
		CONTEXT=Rasputin 's daughter Maria died in the 2006 crash of S7 Airlines Flight 778 , and his wife died six years later . He died in Moscow on 14 March 2015 , a day short of his 78th birthday . Patriarch Kirill of the Russian Orthodox Church conducted his funeral service , and President Vladimir Putin paid his respects . ( In 2014 Rasputin had co-signed a letter by writers in support of Putin 's annexation of the Crimea . ) Rasputin is closely associated with a movement in post-war Soviet literature known as " village prose , " or sometimes " rural prose " ( деревенская проза ) . Beginning in the time of the Khrushchev Thaw ( оттепель ) , village prose was praised for its stylistic and thematic departures from socialist realism . Village prose works usually focused on the hardships of the Soviet peasantry , espoused an idealized picture of traditional village life , and implicitly or explicitly criticized official modernization projects . Rasputin 's 1979 novel '' Farewell to Matyora '' , which depicts a fictional Siberian village which is to be evacuated and cleared so that a hydroelectric dam can be constructed further down the Angara River , was considered the epitome of this genre . The opening paragraph below is a good example of Rasputin 's writing style ( exceptional even for the village prose writers ) , and the novel 's theme of natural cycles disrupted by modernization : '' Once more spring had come , one more in the never-ending cycle , but for Matyora this spring would be the last , the last for both the island and the village that bore the same name . Once more , rumbling passionately , the ice broke , piling up mounds on the banks , and the liberated Angara River opened up , stretching out into a mighty , sparkling flow . Once more the water gushed boisterously at the island ’s upper tip , before cascading down both channels of the riverbed ; once more greenery flared on the ground and in the greens , the first rains soaked the earth , the swifts and swallows flew back , and at dusk in the bogs the awakened frogs croaked their love of life . It had all happened many times before . '' ( From Rasputin 's novel '' Farewell to Matyora '' , translated by Antonina W. Bouis , 1979 ) Rasputin 's nonfiction works contain similar themes , often in support of relevant political causes . He directed particularly trenchant criticism at large-scale dam building , like the project that flooded his own hometown , and water management projects , like the diversion of the Siberian rivers to Central Asia . He argued that these projects were destructive not simply in an ecological sense , but in a moral sense as well

		CONTEXT=On February 19 – 20 , 1884 , one of the largest and most widespread tornado outbreaks in American history occurred over the Southeastern United States . The outbreak produced the largest 24 - hour total of killer tornadoes until the 1974 Super Outbreak on April 3 – 4 . The precise number of tornadoes as well as fatalities incurred during the outbreak is unknown , but the death toll was variously estimated to range from 370 – 2,000 at the time . A reliable survey by the Signal Corps in 1889 located 182 fatalities , and a reanalysis by tornado researcher Thomas P. Grazulis in 1993 counted 178 deaths . Nonetheless , an inspection of newspaper reports and governmental studies published in the aftermath reveals successive , long - tracked tornado families striking Alabama , Georgia , Illinois , Indiana , Kentucky , Mississippi , North Carolina , South Carolina , Tennessee and Virginia , with an estimation of at least 37 tornadoes . [ 10 ] [ 11 ] Some events counted as tornadoes in initial studies such as those by John Park Finley were likely downbursts , especially in northern and northeastern portions of the outbreak . [ 11 ]

		GOLD_MENTION=Kobe earthquake
		CONTEXT=The discovery of LFEs originates in Japan at the Nankai trough and is in part due to the nationwide collaboration of seismological research following the Kobe earthquake of 1995 . Low frequency earthquakes in Japan were first observed in a subduction setting where the Philippine Sea plate subducts at the Nankai trough near Shikoku . The low-frequency continuous tremor researchers observed was initially interpreted to be a result of dehydration reactions in the subducting plate . The source of these tremors occurred at an average depth of around 30 kilometers , and they were distributed along the strike of the subduction interface over a length of 600 kilometers . Similar to Cascadia , these low frequency tremors occurred with slow slip events that had a recurrence interval of approximately 6 months . The later discovery of LFEs forming tremor confirmed the widespread existence of LFEs at Japanese subduction zones , and LFEs are widely observed and believed to occur as a result of SSEs

		CONTEXT=Earthquakes are common , and large-scale ones occur around every 300 years . The Cascadia earthquake of 1700 — estimated at 8.7 – 9.2 on the moment magnitude scale — caused a tsunami to sweep across California , Oregon , Washington , and British Columbia , reaching Japan the next day . It was produced when the entire Cascadia subduction zone , about long , slipped approximately in a megathrust event . Another major earthquake occurred in 1873 near present-day Brookings . With a magnitude of 7.3 , the quake was felt from Seattle to San Francisco . Wind is also a factor in the region ; storms can sometimes reach over . The Columbus Day Storm of 1962 brought devastating winds to nearly all of Oregon ; nearby Port Orford recorded gusts exceeding . The storm killed 38 people across the state and caused over $ 200 million worth of damage . The watershed often experiences wildfires , some of them major .

The 1855 earthquake occurred on the Wairarapa Fault which is part of the North Island Fault System . At 11.16 pm a small and sharp but brief earthquake of magnitude 7.2 Ms ( Mw 6.9-7.2 ) shook a wide area in the lower North Island from Eketahuna to Masterton , Featherston and Wellington ; and was noticed from Auckland to near Dunedin . The main earthquake was of 7.2 Ms and the epicentre was near Masterton and 12 km deep . The quake lasted for over a minute and had been preceded by a foreshock three hours earlier at 8.15 pm . Many buildings in Masterton were damaged . The mayor Thomas Jordan declared a state of emergency and got troops to patrol the town . There was considerable damage in Palmerston North . In Wellington twenty thousand chimneys fell , and there was one death in the suburb of Kelburn when a 70-year old retired chemist Hedley Victor Evens ( sic ) was killed by coal gas from a fractured pipe . Some downtown pediments were damaged , but some had already been removed after the 1931 Hawke 's Bay earthquake . The city engineer K. E . Luke held that damage was less severe as the quake ended swiftly . Another shock in the area struck on 2nd August at 12.34 am , preceded by a foreshock on the late afternoon of the 1st . This was of magnitude 7.0 Ms ( Mw 6.8 ) or slightly less than the earlier quake . The epicentre was 40 km deep and at location 41.01 ° S and 175.52 ° E. Wairarapa except for Eketahuna did not suffer as badly , though in Masterton the June damage was exacerbated . The 2 August aftershock was followed by a third severe aftershock on 2 December , with about 600 aftershocks recorded to the end of the year .

		CONTEXT=The region was affected by the Great Fire of 1922 , considered one of the worst disasters ever to befall the area . Haileybury suffered the worst damage , and approximately ninety percent of the town was destroyed , leaving only Millionaire 's Row and a few other neighborhoods intact . The mass destruction is partially attributable to strong wind on the day of the fire . Approximately 3500 people were left homeless by the fire . The Toronto Transit Commission ( TTC ) , with many retired street cars in its yards , sent many old car bodies to serve as houses during the reconstruction . Some of these cars remained for years , and one has recently been restored and is in the museum at Haileybury . As well , the area was affected by the 1935 Timiskaming earthquake , which had its epicentre at Lac Kipawa in Quebec , approximately halfway between the Haileybury/New Liskeard area and North Bay

		CONTEXT=In January 1933 the NSDAP ( Nazi party ) took power and lost little time in establishing a one-party state in Germany . Membership of political parties ( other than of the Nazi party ) was banned which meant that political activities undertaken on behalf of the Communist Party became illegal . Richter nevertheless continued her political resistance work under the new regime . She helped to hide people whom state agencies wished to persecute , undertook courier work between Berlin and Prague and contributed material for illegal publications until April 1934 , which was when she emigrated , initially to Prague and from there to the Soviet Union . Her partner , Hans Günther , was by now already there and was working at the Communist Academy and as a writer . In Moscow Trude Richter was able to complete her post-doctoral dissertation and taught at the Moscow Pedagogical for modern languages . During the next couple of years she pursued her teaching career and produced at least one text-book for language teaching . On 3 November 1936 she took Soviet citizenship : the next day , on 4 November 1936 , Richter and her partner Hans Günther were both arrested and placed in pretrial detention . In the event there was to be no trial , but at the end of 1937 she was nevertheless sentenced to five years of detention in one of the Gulag Labor camps and a lifetime ban . She had , in fact , been expelled from the Communist Party in January 1937 , a couple of months after her initial detention . Grounds for her sentencing were recorded as alleged Counter-revolutionary and Trotskyite activities . On 17 August 1938 she was transferred to the Kolyma concentration camp region in the eastern interior of the Soviet Union , first in the North East " Ispravitel ' no-trudovoj " Rehabilitation Camp and then in the " Teka " " Ispravitel ' no-trudovoj " Dalstroy Rehabilitation Camp .

		GOLD_MENTION=the Lockerbie bombing
		CONTEXT=On 4 October 2009 , Fred Halliday , Emeritus Professor of International Relations at the LSE and the School 's leading expert on the Middle East , wrote a memorandum to the LSE Council regarding the proposed cooperation with the Gaddafi Foundation . " I have repeatedly expressed reservations about formal educational and funding links with that country . " While those in favour of accepting the donation argued that " Libya is changing internally , " most informed observers agree that while some of the worst excesses for the moment have ceased , the rights of its people are badly protected . Libya " remains a country run by a secretive , erratic and corrupt elite . " Since 9/11 the Libyan government has reached compromises with the West on a number of issues , notably the Lockerbie bombing and nuclear weapons . Yet tactical changes in foreign policy are not sufficient for the purposes of evaluating political and academic links . There are also ways in which Libyan foreign policy has '' not '' changed : the country continues to call for the destruction of Israel ; Muammar Gaddafi recently called for the abolition of Switzerland , and he receives the leader of the Somali pirates operating off the Horn of Africa as honoured guests of state . Moreover , Libya 's handling of the Lockerbie bombing " has not been characterised by either consistency or clarity , " I have in the past , Halliday noted , defended accepting grants from authoritarian regimes such as the Gulf states , " but there should be clear limits on this , depending on the degree of political and human rights abuses perpetrated with them and on their ongoing foreign policy conduct . " Whitehall and the City are now happy to do business with Libya , but it does not follow that the LSE should do the same . Responsible leaders throughout the Middle East continue to express reservations regarding Libya , including " its more prominent ' liberal ' representatives . " We must remember , Halliday concluded , that the " liberal " wing within a regime such as Libya does not have the function of producing change but its role is instead " to reach compromises with internal hard-liners that serve to lessen external pressure . " A good case in point are the proposals LSE now is considering . It is , as LSE alumni in positions of responsibility in the region caution , " far too early for the School to take this step . " In 2009 , Human Rights Watch was allowed entry to Libya , via Saif al-Islam Gaddafi 's non-profit organization in order to gather facts about the human rights situation there . While HRW reported that there were concerns about the " repressive atmosphere , " they felt there were signs of " improvement " and Sarah Leah Whitson , director of HRW 's Middle East division said that one should not " underestimate the importance of the efforts made so far " by Gaddafi in the realm of human rights in Libya . She also wrote of her official visit that " the real impetus for the transformation rests squarely with a quasi-governmental organization , the Qaddafi Foundation for International Charities and Development " chaired by Gaddafi . She praised Gaddafi for establishing the country 's two semi-private newspapers , and said " it is impossible to underestimate the importance of the efforts made so far . Let 's hope this spring will last . " In January 2011 , HRW criticised other organisations as well as governments that had previously dealt with Gaddafi . HRW Business and Human Rights Director Arvind Ganesan condemned the London School of Economics ( LSE ) for allowing " abusive and corrupt officials or their families to launder their images in exchange for money " . This was later followed by Ganesen saying that " the London School of Economics did not act until Saif al-Islam 's father literally began to kill his own people " . According to NGO Monitor , this was despite the fact that David Held , Co-Director of LSE Global Governance , was partially influenced by Whitson 's remarks regarding her Libyan visit , referring to Saif al-Islam Gaddafi as a reformer

Cox and Natasha Lowe and was directed by Joe Jahraus.The '' Chicago Tribune '' reviewer wrote : " Interesting and formatively atypical , it strikes me as very much a meditation on what is and is not true , on the ease of rushing to misjudgment , and also a further manifestation of the longstanding authorial fascination with the close link between deep intimacy and dark violence . " This production was followed by a Contemporary American Theater Festival ( Shepherdstown , West Virginia ) production as part of the 2012 Festival from 6 to 29 July 2012

Members of the CMP posed as representatives of a biotechnology company in order to gain access to both meetings with abortion providers and abortion facilities . The videos showed how abortion providers made fetal tissue available to researchers , although no problems were found with the legality of the process . All of the videos were found to be altered , according to analysis by Fusion GPS and its co-founder Glenn R. Simpson , a former investigative reporter for The Wall Street Journal . The CMP disputed this finding , attributing the alterations to the editing out of " bathroom breaks and waiting periods .

The analysis by Fusion GPS concluded that the longer version was also edited , with skips and missing footage .

No such attempts by Congress to cut federal family planning money from Planned Parenthood have become law .

" Sava noted that while the episode was humorous , much of the comedy was undercut by the tragic and distressing nature of Finn 's story . Andrew Tran of Overmental argued that " the episode ... dissects vividly that bottomless feeling of midlife wanderlust ... not the road-trippy , running-through-the-fields kind but rather the life-map-disappearing-in-your-hands , what-the-hell-is-next kind .

		ANSWER=Barry Gifford remembers that there was a prevailing mood that the media was hoping Lynch would fail .
		GOLD_MENTION=1990 Cannes Film Festival
		CONTEXT=Early test screenings did not go well , with the strong violence in some scenes being too much . At the first test screening , eighty people walked out during a graphic torture scene involving Johnnie Farragut . Lynch decided not to cut anything from the film and at the second screening one hundred people walked out during this scene . Lynch remembers , " By then , I knew the scene was killing the film . So I cut it to the degree that it was powerful but did n't send people running from the theatre " . In retrospect , the filmmaker said , " But that was part of what '' Wild at Heart '' was about : really insane and sick and twisted stuff going on . " The film was completed one day before it debuted at the 1990 Cannes Film Festival in the 2,400-seat Grand Auditorium . After the screening , it received " wild cheering " from the audience . When Jury President Bernardo Bertolucci announced '' Wild at Heart '' as the Palme d'Or winner at the awards ceremony , the boos almost drowned out the cheers , with film critic Roger Ebert leading the vocal detractors . Barry Gifford remembers that there was a prevailing mood that the media was hoping Lynch would fail . " All kinds of journalists were trying to cause controversy and have me say something like ' This is nothing like the book ' or ' He ruined my book ' . I think everybody from '' Time '' magazine to '' What 's On In London '' was disappointed when I said ' This is fantastic . This is wonderful . It 's like a big , dark , musical comedy ' "

		CONTEXT=Although traditionally Titus Andronicus has been seen as one of Shakespeare 's least respected plays , its fortunes have changed somewhat in the latter half of the twentieth century , with numerous scholars arguing that the play is more accomplished than has hitherto been allowed for . In particular , scholars have argued that the play is far more thematically complex than has traditionally been thought , and features profound insights into ancient Rome , Elizabethan society , and the human condition . Such scholars tend to argue that these previously unacknowledged insights have only become apparent during the twentieth and twenty - first centuries as only now has the ultraviolent content of the play achieved a sense of relevance . For example , in his 1987 edition of the play for the Contemporary Shakespeare series , A.L. Rowse writes ; " in the civilised Victorian age the play could not be performed because it could not be believed . Such is the horror of our own age , with the appalling barbarities of prison camps and resistance movements paralleling the torture and mutilation and feeding on human flesh of the play , that it has ceased to be improbable . " Similarly , director Julie Taymor , who staged a production Off - Broadway in 1994 and directed a film version in 1999 , says she was drawn to the play because she found it to be the most " relevant of Shakespeare 's plays for the modern era ; " She feels that the play has more relevance for us than it had for the Victorians ; " it seems like a play written for today , it reeks of now . " Because of this new found relevance , previously unrecognised thematic strands have thus come to the forefront .

		CONTEXT=In 18th - and 19th - century Italy , the cicisbeo ( , , ; plural : cicisbei ) or ( ) was the man who was the professed gallant or lover of a woman married to someone else . With the knowledge and consent of the husband , the cicisbeo attended his mistress at public entertainments , to church and other occasions , and had privileged access to this woman . The arrangement is comparable to the Spanish cortejo or estrecho and , to a lesser degree , to the French petit - maître . The exact etymology of the word is unknown ; some evidence suggests it originally meant " in a whisper " ( perhaps an onomatopeic word ) . Other accounts suggest it is an inversion of bel cece , which means " beautiful chick ( pea ) " . According to OED , the first recorded usage of the term in English was found in a letter by Lady Mary Wortley Montagu dated 1718 . The term appears in Italian in Giovanni Maria Muti 's Quaresimale Del Padre Maestro Fra Giovanni Maria Muti De Predicatori of 1708 ( p. 734 ) .

		GOLD_MENTION=Sundance last January
		CONTEXT=On January 27 , 2011 the festival sent 9 filmmakers to 9 cities across the US to screen and discuss their films . The cities and films included : Bob Tourtellotte of Reuters wrote " Sundance 2011 has proven to be exceptionally strong , audiences and filmmakers seem to agree . " Tourtellotte reported that Robert Redford said that three years ago the Sundance Institute " set out to get back to its roots of supporting alternative voices in cinema and he felt like this year that strategy paid off . " Redford said " This year , what has excited me , is I think the quality is increasing in diversity and is increasing in depth . " The AP reported that Redford said it 's " always a relief " when the festival ends because " it 's really exhausting . " Kenneth Turan , film critic for the '' Los Angeles Times '' , wrote " though the festival has gotten ever bigger — and ( thankfully ) more efficient in moving its close to 50,000 attendees in and out of its far-flung theaters — it still retains the scrappy , antic spirit that has animated it from the start . " Turan wrote " One of the paradoxes of Sundance is that the quirkiness and charm around the edges of the festival are not always fully appreciated because so much of the media focus is on the premieres section and the U.S. dramatic competition " which he said " are , frankly , often the weakest parts of the festival . " Turan said " Sundance 's insistence on giving equal weight to documentaries and dramas has made it into as important a nonfiction showcase as any festival in the world ; witness the fact that four out of the five Oscar-nominated docs this year debuted at Sundance last January . " He also wrote that the foreign language film competition " is a strength at Sundance , and yet that field is given even less popular attention than the documentaries . " Peter Knegt wrote that this year 's festival " probably wo n't replicate last year 's Oscar record . " He said " Despite a huge surge in sales , this year 's Sundance slate looks like it might be the least Oscar-friendly in some time . " He noted that the U.S. Dramatic Grand Jury Prize winners have been nominated for Best Picture for two years ( referring to '' Precious '' and '' Winter 's Bone '' ) . Knegt speculated on films that might be nominated for the Oscars . Films he deemed " most likely to succeed " at being nominated included : '' Like Crazy '' for Best Picture , Michael Shannon of '' Take Shelter '' for Best Actor , Elizabeth Olsen of '' Martha Marcy May Marlene '' for Best Actress , Felicity Jones of '' Like Crazy '' for Best Actress , Jessica Chastain of '' Take Shelter '' for Best Supporting Actress , '' Project Nim '' for Best Documentary Feature , '' Page One '' for Best Documentary Feature , and '' The Interrupters '' for Best Documentary Feature . He wrote " It 's reasonable to feel assured that at least one of Sundance 's docs will end up an Oscar nominee , if not two , three or four . " Jada Yuan of '' New York '' magazine wrote " perhaps the biggest highlight of the festival is just how ripe it 's been for acquisitions , with nearly 30 films getting picked up , the most at any Sundance ever . " On " why everyone is suddenly so bullish on independent film " , Owen Gleiberman wrote that the " energy and optimism at Sundance this year was n't just hype . " He said the factors he thought were driving a new evolving vision of the indie film world included : " The deals have n’t gotten cheaper — they 've gotten smarter " , a belief that last year 's new festival director John Cooper and director of programming Trevor Groth " have re-energized the festival , heightening its quality and organizing the movies with a tempting new shape and vision " , video on demand gives distributors a safety net and more confidence , and the audiences for Sundance movies are not going away , saying " The Oscars ... have become a testament to the central place that Sundance movies now occupy . " Redford was happy about the success of the festival , with about 45 films being sold vs 14 in 2010 , an increase of about 220 % . Redford said studios are realizing " there are audiences " for indie films

		CONTEXT=Mordaunt Hall of '' The New York Times '' also gave the film a stellar review , calling it , " A graphic and engrossing screen conception of Edna Ferber 's widely read novel ... " , and also praised the handling of the passage of time in this epic . Hall also singled out the performance of Dunne . '' Motion Picture Magazine '' raved , " A great and worthy effort , this transcription of early Oklahoma life will be hailed as one of the high-spots of the year . It has everything . RKO seems to have placed no restrictions upon making it a lavish , bona-fide epic . " John Mosher of '' The New Yorker '' praised the " great care " that had been taken with the historical accuracy of the film 's visual details , that he thought " as good as anything that has come out of Hollywood , and because of this expertness the film gains especial value . " He also wrote that Richard Dix was " certainly at his best in this role . " His only criticisms concerned the second half of the film , that he thought had " sagging moments " and an ending that was too abrupt . '' The Evening Independent '' called it " a notable addition to the small list of pictures that the years have given to the American theater . For in '' Cimarron '' is vested stirring drama , stark beauty , daring and adventure on a plane that is seldom seen on the screen . " The '' West Seattle Herald '' declared that it was " even more powerful than the great story read by millions in America . '' Cimarron '' the picture is all that is gripping in '' Cimarron '' the story . Spectacular scenes abound in this production . " Elizabeth Yeaman of Hollywood Daily Citizen saw the film as a new type of history , writing that , “ Like history , the picture has moments of thrilling glory and moments of repetition and daily routine . Cimarron does not follow the rules of story construction ... It is , in short , a graphic interpretation of a portion of history , the history of the state of Oklahoma from the time of the first great land rush until the present . ” More recent appraisals of the film have not been as positive . '' Cimarron '' currently holds a 53 % approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes , based on 19 reviews , with a weighted average of 5.2 / 10 . The site 's consensus reads : " '' Cimarron '' is supported by a strong performance from Irene Dunne , but uneven in basically every other regard , and riddled with potentially offensive stereotypes " . Assessing the film in 2009 , James Berardinelli called it " an excellent study of how tastes have changed over the years . Critically lauded at the time of its release , '' Cimarron '' was beloved by most who saw it . Eight decades later , it is frequently cited on lists of the most undeserving Academy Award winners and is rightfully impugned for racist overtones and scattershot storytelling . " Steve Evans of '' DVD Verdict '' wrote , " Seen with contemporary eyes , the film is badly dated , slow moving , and pocked with racist caricatures .... The recreation of the great 1889 Oklahoma Land Rush remains an exciting spectacle .... Unfortunately , the film never manages to top this opening shot . " At the 1931 Academy Awards ceremony at the Biltmore Hotel in Los Angeles , '' Cimarron '' was the first film to receive more than six Academy Awards nominations and be nominated for the Big Five awards ( Best Picture , Best Director , Best Actor , Best Actress , and Best Writing ) . Additionally , it is one of only two films ( the other being '' Who 's Afraid of Virginia Woolf ? '' ) to receive nominations in every eligible category . It won for three of them , including Best Picture . It would win the first of only two Best Picture Oscars for the studio , the other being awarded to 1946 's '' The Best Years of Our Lives '' . It was the first Western to win the Best Picture award , and it would not be until 1990 when '' Dances with Wolves '' won , that another Western would garner that honor

Cox and Natasha Lowe and was directed by Joe Jahraus.The '' Chicago Tribune '' reviewer wrote : " Interesting and formatively atypical , it strikes me as very much a meditation on what is and is not true , on the ease of rushing to misjudgment , and also a further manifestation of the longstanding authorial fascination with the close link between deep intimacy and dark violence . " This production was followed by a Contemporary American Theater Festival ( Shepherdstown , West Virginia ) production as part of the 2012 Festival from 6 to 29 July 2012

		CONTEXT=In early 2013 , Gosling announced that he was taking a break from acting , stating , " I 've lost perspective on what I 'm doing . I think it 's good for me to take a break and reassess why I 'm doing it and how I 'm doing it . And I think this is probably a good way to learn about that . " Gosling 's directorial debut '' Lost River '' competed in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival . The " fantasy noir " , written by Gosling , stars Christina Hendricks , Ben Mendelsohn , and Matt Smith . The film received largely unfavorable reviews . Peter Bradshaw of '' The Guardian '' found it " insufferably conceited " and remarked that Gosling had lost " any sense of proportion or humility . " Robbie Collin of '' The Telegraph '' described '' Lost River '' as " mind-bogglingly pleased with itself " , while '' Variety '' s Justin Chang dismissed the " derivative " film as a " train-wreck . " In 2015 , he played a bond salesman in the ensemble financial satire '' The Big Short '' , a Best Picture nominee at the 2016 Academy Awards . David Sims of '' The Atlantic '' felt that he was " smarmily funny , somehow simultaneously magnetic and repulsive ; after years wandering the halls of mediocre art cinema , it 's wonderful to see him cut loose again . " Peter Travers of '' Rolling Stone '' said : " Gosling , a virtuoso of verbal sleaze , talks directly to the camera , and he 's volcanically fierce and funny . " The following year , Gosling starred in the black comedy '' The Nice Guys '' , opposite Russell Crowe , and in Damien Chazelle 's musical '' La La Land '' , for which he won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and received his second Academy Award for Best Actor nomination . Robbie Collins took note of his chemistry with co-star Emma Stone and wrote , " Both stars are so attuned to each other ’s pace and flow that their repartee just seems to tumble out , perfectly formed . " It emerged as one of his most commercially successful films , with earnings of over $ 440 million against its $ 30 million budget

		GOLD_MENTION=MTV Movie Award
		CONTEXT=Elvis Mitchell of '' The New York Times '' wrote : " The performances give the movie more flavor and life than the situation does ; it often feels like prechewed Bubble Yum . The message of the plot is that a lack of sophistication is the key to success , even at a fashion magazine that attracts readers through sexy exhibitionism . The movie would have shown some daring savvy if it had played more with the role-playing aspect of fashion spreads . Instead it is content to eat its retro snack cake and have it , too . " Andrea Gronvall of the '' Chicago Reader '' wrote that " The formula works , thanks in large part to star Jennifer Garner , who 's so radiant theaters should be stocking sunblock . Underlying the shenanigans and the pop-psychology moral — self-love is a prerequisite for true love — there 's a touching wistfulness about roads not taken . " Jorge Morales of '' The Village Voice '' commented : " The thirtysomething in me was all , gag me with a spoon , but the kid in me was like , this movie 's rad to the max . " Garner was nominated for MTV Movie Award and Teen Choice awards for her role as Jenna Rink

		GOLD_MENTION=1990 Cannes Film Festival
		CONTEXT=Early test screenings did not go well , with the strong violence in some scenes being too much . At the first test screening , eighty people walked out during a graphic torture scene involving Johnnie Farragut . Lynch decided not to cut anything from the film and at the second screening one hundred people walked out during this scene . Lynch remembers , " By then , I knew the scene was killing the film . So I cut it to the degree that it was powerful but did n't send people running from the theatre " . In retrospect , the filmmaker said , " But that was part of what '' Wild at Heart '' was about : really insane and sick and twisted stuff going on . " The film was completed one day before it debuted at the 1990 Cannes Film Festival in the 2,400-seat Grand Auditorium . After the screening , it received " wild cheering " from the audience . When Jury President Bernardo Bertolucci announced '' Wild at Heart '' as the Palme d'Or winner at the awards ceremony , the boos almost drowned out the cheers , with film critic Roger Ebert leading the vocal detractors . Barry Gifford remembers that there was a prevailing mood that the media was hoping Lynch would fail . " All kinds of journalists were trying to cause controversy and have me say something like ' This is nothing like the book ' or ' He ruined my book ' . I think everybody from '' Time '' magazine to '' What 's On In London '' was disappointed when I said ' This is fantastic . This is wonderful . It 's like a big , dark , musical comedy ' "

		ANSWER=Virna Lisi
		GOLD_MENTION=Cannes
		CONTEXT=In 1983 , Chéreau directed the film '' The Wounded Man ( L'Homme Blessé '' ) , a more personal project for him . He and his co-writer , Hervé Guibert , worked for six years on the scenario , which tells of a love affair between an older man involved in prostitution and a teenage boy , a dark view in the context of HIV/AIDS . His 1994 film was '' La Reine Margot '' , based on the 1845 historical novel of the same name by Alexandre Dumas . It won the Jury Prize and Best Actress Award ( Virna Lisi ) at Cannes , as well as five César Awards . Set in the 16th-century , depicting the conflict between Catholics and Protestants in France , it shows battles and the St Bartholomew 's day massacre . A scene of the queen with the head of her lover is reminiscent of the opera '' Salome '' , uniting cult and obsession ( " Einheit von Kult und Obsession " ) , as Koch remarks . The film was Chéreau 's longest , most expensive production , and his greatest financial success . " I t was erotic and violent , and offers poured in from Hollywood , " but , he said , " I was always being offered films based in the Renaissance and involving a massacre . I even had an offer from the UK to do a film about Guy Fawkes . " He refused similar offers : " It 's useless to repeat something you already did . " In 1993 , in a rare acting role , he appeared as General Montcalm in Michael Mann 's '' The Last of the Mohicans ''
