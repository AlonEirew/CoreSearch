QUERY_ANSWERS={'1977 flood', 'massive flood', 'Johnstown Flood of 1977'}
QUERY_CONTEXT=The flood was preceded by rains from March 9 that did not stop until March 22 , 1936 . The storms brought warmer 50 °F ( 10 °C ) weather that was a cause of one stage of flooding and the continuous rains a second cause of flooding . The natural run-off of 1 to 3 inches ( 2.5 to 7.5 cm ) was far surpassed by the deluge of from 10 to 30 inches ( 25 to 75 cm ) of water in the region . The flood came before pending flood control legislation was enacted or any significant flood control measures implemented . The narrowness of the valleys and encroachment of buildings on the river banks contributed to record flooding . By the time nightfall came one-third of the city was under of water and by the time flooding was over twenty-five people lost their lives . The damages , estimated at $ 43 million , made it the worst flood since the flood of 1889 and the event is chronicled at the Johnstown Flood Museum After the flood , sweeping nationwide flood control laws were enacted and from 1938 to 1943 Johnstown saw many projects completed . These measures gave the people the feeling that the area was now " flood free " , and it was touted as such until the flood of 1977

		CONTEXT=In 1977 the Board of Governors of the World Bank approved Bura Irrigation and Settlement Project ( BISP ) in Kenya . The project area is situated just South of the Equator in the Lower Tana Basin . It lies on the west bank of the Tana River and falls within the administrative area of Tana River County . The project was an ambitious attempt of the government of Kenya , the World Bank and a few other donors to develop a remote area , create employment for thousands of people with a reasonable income and earn foreign exchange . Bura project would develop about 6,700 net irrigated ha over a 5 1/2 year period and settle on smallholdings about 5,150 landless poor families selected from all parts of Kenya . Physical and social infrastructure would be provided to support the settler and satellite population , expected to reach a total of 65,000 persons by 1985 . The total cost of the project was estimated at 92 million dollars in 1977 prices . Actual construction started in 1978 . During implementation the costs exploded from $ 17,500 / = per family to $ 55,000 / = , a new record for the World Bank . The largest cost increase was for the irrigation network ( 615 % ) . The donors were not willing and the government was not able to raise the additional funds and subsequently the size of the project was scaled down from 6,700 ha to 3,900 and later to 2,500 ha , although the irrigation structures were completed for 6,700 ha . In this period 2,100 landless households from all over Kenya were settled in the scheme . They were allocated two plots of 0.625 ha and a garden of 0.05 ha . Each year they were to grow 1.25 ha cotton and 0.625 maize intercropped with cowpeas . Soon it was evident that the project would fail to achieve its objectives . Job creation was only 40 % of the target , the economic rate of return was negative and the annual operating and maintenance costs exceeded the benefits . Even with net farm incomes of about 40 % of the appraisal estimates in real terms , annual government subsidies amounted to about 1,000 dollars per settler . The project had an unreliable water supply and many buildings had foundation problems . After cotton crop failures due to pests in 1990 the project came virtually to a standstill as the management lacked the funds to finance cotton and maize crops . Most settlers deserted and the only the ones with nowhere to go remained in the scheme , living on famine relief and odd jobs . In the period 1993 - 2005 a number of times the government tried to revive a number of timesthe project , but all in vain . After 2005 , rehabilitation and crop growing started in phases and since 2009 - 10 the tenants have been growing crops , although the cropping pattern comed down to no more than 50 % of the projected crop intensity and the settlers have low incomes , if any . This is partly caused by the fact that the original cash crop , cotton , is no longer a profitable crop .

He noted that MAS , " except in its most public of statements " , was open about its agenda . He argued that while Bray " tries to portray MAS as an organization that embraces these shared liberal democratic values , the group simultaneously teaches its members that all government should become Islamic and that non-Islamic judicial systems should be boycotted . " In July 2005 , after the London bombings that killed 52 people , Bray said : " Let me say to the terrorists very clearly , that you will have no comfort in our community . Our community offers you no harbor . Our message is clear , you do no service to Islam , you do a great disservice to Islam and for the love of God , stop this madness . " When the '' Philadelphia Inquirer '' published some of the cartoons of Mohammed in the 2005 Mohammed cartoons controversy , Bray said : " This has nothing to do with free speech ; its pure sensationalism that reeks of religious disrespect . What the '' Philadelphia Inquirer '' has done is irresponsible , provocative , and reckless . " When in November 2006 , two imams from Boston-area mosques were arrested and charged with being involved in a scheme that secured religious worker visas for immigrants who instead got secular jobs , Bray said : " If this was sic clerics who were anything other than Muslims , would they have had to face this ? " After the September 2007 resignation of Esam Omeish from a Virginia Commission on Immigration , after it was revealed that he had publicly endorsed " the jihad way " in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict , Bray said " What 's the big news ?

This should be a moment where we 're having a big conversation . " She also urged caution on the proposed project saying that " This is n't a little tiny pipeline ; this is a pipeline that cuts our country literally in half . " Jackson has spoken out against the Senate Joint Resolution 26 ( the Murkowski Amendment ) , which would take away the EPA 's authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act , which was expanded by the 2007 Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency . Regulations that Senator Lisa Murkowski calls an " economic train-wreck . " In an op-ed in the Huffington Post on the Murkowski Amendment , Jackson said that " now is not the time to take a big step backward , by doubling down on the kinds of energy and environmental policies that keep America addicted to oil .

Senator Inhofe , who 's a ranking member on the Senate Committee on the Environment , and does not believe that human activity causes global climate change , called on Jackson to reconsider new greenhouse gas regulations after the Climatic Research Unit email controversy . With Jackson responding saying that " The science behind climate change is settled , and human activity is responsible for global warming , " and that " That conclusion is not a partisan one . " Though Jackson and Inhofe have conflicted views on Environmental issues , in an interview he called her " One of my favorite Liberals .

		SCORE=4.736149890050001e-07
		CONTEXT=In 1988 , the party made '' The Next Step '' into a bulletin for its supporters . Later that year , a monthly magazine called '' Living Marxism '' was set up for a wider readership . Despite its beginnings as a far-left outlet , the politics espoused by the magazine developed a pronounced libertarianism . In December 1990 , '' Living Marxism '' ran an article which argued that the corrosive effect of the collapse of both Stalinism and reformism on the working class meant that " for the time being at least , the working class has no political existence " . In 1997 , the point was put more forcefully : In today 's circumstances class politics can not be reinvented , rebuilt , reinvigorated or rescued . Why ? Because any dynamic political outlook needs to exist in an interaction with existing individual consciousness . And contemporary forms of consciousness in our atomised societies can not be used as the foundation for a more developed politics of solidarity . Between 1990 and 1997 , the party developed the view that more than capitalism itself the danger facing humanity was the absence of a force for social change ( in philosophical language , a " subject " of history ) and the culture of low expectations that suppressed it . Prefacing a 1996 '' Living Marxism '' manifesto , Mick Hume argued : Of course ... we could have produced a familiar list of left-wing slogans complaining about problems like unemployment , exploitation and poverty which continue to scar our society . But that would be to ignore the transformation which has taken place in the political climate ... . At different times , different issues matter most . Each era has thrown up its own great questions which define which side you are on ... . A t '' Living Marxism '' , we see our job today as doing much more than criticising capitalism . That is the easy bit . There is a more pressing need to criticise the fatalistic critics , to counter the doom-mongers and put a positive case for human action in pursuit of social liberation . ... D ealing with ... unconventional questions , and puncturing the anti-human prejudices which surround them , is the precondition for making political action possible in our time . In February 1997 , shortly after the party disbanded , '' Living Marxism '' re-branded as '' LM '' , possibly to further distance itself from its leftist origins . Articles in '' LM '' argued : This magazine ran at least two articles in which the authors argued that the mass murder carried out in Rwanda in 1994 should not be described as genocide . In December 1995 , '' LM '' carried a report from an aid worker in Rwanda which argued : The lesson I would draw from my visit is that we must reject the term ' genocide ' in Rwanda . It has been used inside and outside Rwanda to criminalise the majority of ordinary Rwandan people , to justify outside interference in the country 's affairs , and to lend legitimacy to a minority military government imposed on Rwanda by Western powers . '' LM '' continued to create controversy on a variety of issues , most notably on the British Independent Television News ( ITN ) coverage of the Balkan conflict in the 1990s . The controversy centred on '' LM '' featuring an article by Thomas Deichmann in which he alleged that the ITN coverage of a refugee detention centre in Trnopolje during the conflict gave the false impression that the Bosnian Muslims were being held against their will in Serbian concentration camps . The ensuing libel award and costs arising from legal action by the ITN against '' LM '' were estimated to total around £ 1 million . The action bankrupted the magazine and its publishers

Since the 2011 Egyptian Revolution , unrest has become more prevalent in the area including the 2012 Egyptian-Israeli border attack in which 16 Egyptian soldiers were killed by militants .

Investigations have shown that these were mainly motivated by a resentment of the poverty faced by many Bedouin in the area . Attacking the tourist industry was viewed as a method of damaging the industry so that the government would pay more attention to their situation . ( See 2004 Sinai bombings , 2005 Sharm El Sheikh bombings and 2006 Dahab bombings ) . Since the 2011 Egyptian Revolution , unrest has become more prevalent in the area including the 2012 Egyptian-Israeli border attack in which 16 Egyptian soldiers were killed by militants .

QUERY_CONTEXT=In the 1959 review for '' Sight & Sound '' , David Vaughan calls '' Gigi '' " an elegant film " with a " cultivated visual taste which is everywhere apparent " . He summarises that " while '' Gigi '' does not represent a revival of the MGM musical in its heyday , it is a welcome extension of latter-day musical style in its adult subject-matter and its avoidance of spectacle made vulgar by emphasis on size . " He praises Minnelli 's talent for " the delicious amorality of the anecdote , but also the honesty and irony of its telling which have become foreign to the American cinema . " Vaughan points out " Chevalier 's practiced but irresistible charm as one of the film 's greatest assets " as well as " the brilliant high-comedy playing of Isabel Jeans , who as Aunt Alicia consummately portrays the distinction and beauty of a retired aristocrat of the '' demimonde '' . " Bosley Crowther of '' The New York Times '' called it " a musical film that bears such a basic resemblance to '' My Fair Lady '' that the authors may want to sue themselves " . He added , " But do n't think this point of resemblance is made in criticism of the film , for '' Gigi '' is a charming entertainment that can stand on its own two legs . It is not only a charming comprehension of the spicy confection of Colette , but it is also a lovely and lyrical enlargement upon that story 's flavored mood and atmosphere … Vincente Minnelli has marshaled a cast to give a set of performances that , for quality and harmony , are superb . " Abel Green of '' Variety '' called the film " 100 % escapist fare " and predicted it " is destined for a global box-office mop-up " . He added , " Alan Jay Lerner 's libretto is tailor-made for an inspired casting job for all principals , and Fritz Loewe 's tunes ( to Lerner 's lyrics ) already vie with and suggest their memorable '' My Fair Lady '' score … Miss Caron is completely captivating and convincing in the title role … Skillful casting , performance and presentation have endowed realism to the sum total … Director Minnelli 's good taste in keeping it in bounds and the general sound judgment of all concerned … distinguishes this Arthur Freed independent production . The Metrocolor rates recognition for its soft pastels under Joseph Ruttenberg 's lensing ; the Beaton costumes , sets and general production design are vivid physical assets at first sight . The skillful integration of words-and-music with the plot motivation makes this '' Gigi '' a very fair lady indeed as a boxoffice entry . " '' Time Out New York '' said , " The dominating creative contribution comes from Minnelli and Cecil Beaton … The combination of these two visual elitists is really too much — it 's like a meal consisting of cheesecake , and one quickly longs for something solid and vulgar to weigh things down . No doubt inspired by the finicky , claustrophobic sets and bric-à-brac , the cast tries ( with unfortunate success ) to be more French than the French , especially Chevalier . The exception is Gingold , who inhabits , as always , a world of her own . " '' TV Guide '' rated the film 3 ½ out of five stars , calling it " Overbaked but enjoyable , and a banquet for the eyes , thanks to the visual wonder of the Minnelli-Beaton teaming … Caron … leads the cast in a contest to see who can be the most French . The winner is Chevalier , in a performance that makes one feel as if you 're gagging on pastry … Perhaps if the sweetness of '' Gigi '' was contrasted with elements of honest vulgarity , the picture could balance itself out … Ten minutes into the movie , you 've resolved the plot and are left to wallow in lovely frou-frou . The film makes wonderful use of the usual Parisian landmarks , and benefits from extraordinary period costumes and sets . " '' Gigi '' won a record-breaking nine Academy Awards ( at the 1959 Oscars ceremony ) ; however , this record only lasted for one year , as '' Ben-Hur '' broke this record the following year with 11 Oscars . In tribute to '' Gigi '' s domination of the Oscars , the MGM switchboard answered calls the following day with " M-Gigi-M " . '' Gigi '' , eventually along with 1987 's '' The Last Emperor '' , held the record as the film ( s ) with the most Academy Award wins in every category in which it was nominated , until 2003 's '' The Lord of the Rings : The Return of the King '' broke the record at the 2004 Oscars ceremony with 11 Oscar nominations and 11 Oscar wins

On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes , the show holds an approval rating of 43 % based on 30 critics , and summarized , " The 90th Academy Awards played it safe and hit no major snags -- but by clocking in at over four hours , returning host Jimmy Kimmel and company wore out their welcome long before the surprise ending . " Hank Stuever of '' The Washington Post '' marked , " In his second year , Kimmel has shown that the telecast need n't be anything but sharp and sure , with a funny host whose bits are manageable , shareable and – best of all – forgotten . We 're not making showbiz history here ; we 're just trying to get through another Oscar night . " Chief critic David Edelstein of '' Vulture '' wrote , " This was the best , most inspiring , and most sheerly likable Academy Awards telecast I 've ever seen . ... It was also – in terms of the actual awards – among the most disappointing . " '' Vanity Fair '' s , Richard Lawson wrote , " As a host , Kimmel struck a careful , appropriately measured tone ... All told , Sunday 's ceremony did an admirable job of recognizing all the turmoil surrounding it while maintaining the silly , chintzy trappings that so many of us tune into the Oscars for . " CNN 's Brian Lowry quipped , " The Oscars are a big , unwieldy beast , which invariably try to serve too many masters . Yet if the intent was ultimately to maintain a celebratory tone without ignoring either the outside world or the elephant in the room throughout this year 's awards , host Jimmy Kimmel and the show itself largely succeeded . " Others were more critical of the show . Television critic Maureen Ryan of '' Variety '' said , " All things considered , the show had a more or less low-key vibe . Normally it takes about two hours for the numbing effect to set in , but despite host Jimmy Kimmel 's best efforts , Sunday 's telecast started to feel a bit languid and low-energy far earlier . " Television critic James Poniewozik of '' The New York Times '' said , " despite the recent upheaval in Hollywood , the ceremony at large still focused mainly on celebration and glitter literally , in the case of the blinding set , which looked as if the ceremony were encased in an enormous geode . There 's also the perennial problem of bloat . The hitch , of course , is that every part of the show has its constituency . " Darren Franich of '' Entertainment Weekly '' wrote , " What fun we had at this year 's Oscars ! Long show , sure , but where to cut it ? " Writing for '' Deadline '' Greg Evans said , " Did the nearly four-hour running time contain any moments for the Oscar ages ? Probably not . " David Wiegand of the '' San Francisco Chronicle '' wrote , " Even the hope that the noise of clapping might keep the audience at home and in the theater awake , there was little of that for anything except the entrance of actors of advance age . " '' The Oregonian '' columnist Kristi Turnquist wrote , " Was it respectful ? Absolutely . Did it make for kind of a dull , earnest Oscars show ? Yeah , kind of . " Attaining 26.5 million U.S. viewers according to Nielsen ratings , the ceremony 's telecast had a 16-percent drop in viewership from last year 's ceremony and had the lowest U.S. viewership in Oscar history . On March 6 , after the final ratings were confirmed , President Donald Trump took to his Twitter account , saying , " Lowest rated Oscars in HISTORY . Problem is , we do n't have stars anymore – except your President ( just kidding , of course ) ! " . In response , Kimmel also tweeted , saying , " Thanks , lowest rated President in HISTORY . " In July 2018 , the ceremony presentation received eight nominations for the 70th Primetime Creative Arts Emmys

When a guard finally grabbed him , Shafrazi shouted , " Call the curator . I am an artist . " The paint was easily removed as the painting was heavily varnished . It is believed that Shafrazi was protesting the announcement , the day before , of the release on bail of U.S. lieutenant William Calley . Calley , then under house arrest following his conviction , in 1971 , for his part in the My Lai massacre in Vietnam , had petitioned for habeas corpus ; he had initially been sentenced to life imprisonment . Although his appeal was overturned in June , he was finally released from U.S. Army custody later in the year after having received a limited pardon from Richard Nixon . Shafrazi was a member of the Art Workers ' Coalition , which in 1970 had staged a protest at MoMA by unfurling a copy of the famous My Lai protest poster '' And babies '' in front of the '' Guernica '' painting , which itself depicts the tragedies of war and the suffering it inflicts upon innocent civilians . Shafrazi was later given five years ' probation , without a trial

		CONTEXT=Critical opinion regarding the film has been overwhelmingly positive . '' The Village Voice '' critic J. Hoberman , who in 1981 included the film in his list of the ten best films commercially released in the United States during that year , more recently wrote that the film is one " of the richest avant-garde features of the 1970s " and praised its " winning combination of sexual frankness and visual wit , " while another critic , Dennis Schwartz , wrote that the " film 's beauty is derived from its sexual frankness and playfully drawn out intimate relationship scenes , witty use of photography , and its originality as it breaks free of conventional unities of body , space and time . Export skillfully edits montage and integrates video , still photography , and performance art with elements from Cubism , Surrealism , Dada and avant-garde cinema . " '' Artforum '' noted in November 1980 that " w atching their scenes together , we realize how seldom , if ever before , the details of sexual intimacy have been shown in film from the point of view from a woman . Export privileges rupture over unity and never settles for one-dimensional solutions " and it was called one " of the most original films in this year 's exposition " and a " tour de force of cinematic invention " grounded in the director 's " fresh and intelligent sensibility , characteristically self-referential . Her visual resources include mirrors , still photography , video , dance , and films within the film , all employed with a bold and surprising inventiveness " by the catalogue notes of the 1978 Los Angeles International Film Exposition . Similarly , critic Alison Butler wrote that the " film is a witty and visually brilliant essay on gender and experience , culture and environment " and program notes used by the San Francisco Cinematheque during a screening quote critic Amy Taubin as opining that the film " makes you reconsider what you and everyone else is doing — in life and in art " and critic Steve Anker underscoring that it is an important " crossover film " combining " avant-garde and theatrical sensibilities , made during the mid-1970s . It chronicles the nightmarish breakdown of a fashion photographer as she confronts her waning identity and security as a career woman ; blending narrative experimentation , fantasy , fact and theoretical critique , it has enormous impact on independent features which followed it . " PopMatters noted that the film has " enough originality to nag at patient viewers and get at least partially under our skin " and critic Michael Atkinson wrote that it is a " weird , restless , beguilingly offbeat bit of dreamwork . " The film was presented for the first time at the Berlin International Film Festival in 1977 , it has won a Special Jury Prize at the Venice Film Festival and was recently called " seminal " during a screening at a repertory cinema , " a strong and humoristic showdown " at another and " a sonically-complex , montage-rich , darkly funny and uriniferous cornerstone of avant-garde cinema " during a screening at a New York University class . Critic Peter Hajek wrote in the Austrian newspaper '' Kurier '' that " Valie Export presents this psychopanoptic view of the present in solid , striking images and often in unexpected humorous passages . " Critic Chris Holmlund , author of the scholarly article " Feminist Makeovers : The Celluloid Surgery of Valie Export and Su Friedrich , " referred to '' Invisible Adversaries '' as a feminist version of '' Invasion of the Body Snatchers '' , noted that the film includes references to famous paintings and to '' Un Chien Andalou '' , and wrote that therefore it " is visually rick , entertaining , striking , but also demanding . " A few reviews , however , were negative . For example , London 's '' Time Out '' wrote about the film that it is " n ot unlike '' W.R. : Mysteries of the Organism '' " and that it will " probably age as badly " and a reviewer for '' The Heights '' wrote that " I was expecting a great feminist work here , but got mediocrity . I can not recommend that you see this film , " though he nevertheless praised the film as a " cornucopia of video spectacle in which Export delights , confounds and amuses the audience with her antics .

		CONTEXT=New Regent Street is a pedestrian mall in Christchurch . Built as a private development in the early 1930s with 40 shops in Spanish Mission architectural style , it is one of the city 's major tourist attractions . Providing a number of small shops as a comprehensive development was an advanced idea at the time , and New Regent Street is regarded as a forerunner to modern shopping malls . Due to its coherent architectural character , the buildings in the streets are listed as Category I heritage items by Heritage New Zealand , and in addition , the entire street has a historic area listing . The street was pedestrianised in 1994 in preparation for the introduction of the Christchurch heritage tram , which began operation in February 1995 . Damaged in the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake , the street and buildings reopened in April 2013 , and the tram returned from November of that year . Following the 2016 Valentine 's Day earthquake , five of the buildings that had not been repaired after the previous earthquakes have been cordoned off , which stopped the tram from operating on its original heritage loop until May

		CONTEXT=Although filming began in 1987 , the film was released only a year after . It turned out to be a box-office failure but won critical acclaim . Balu Mahendra admitted that he did not expect the film to be a box-office success or a failure , but would have the satisfaction of having made a good film . Archana 's portrayal as a middle-class woman fetched her a lot of accolades from the critics . Chokkalinga Bhagavathar , who played her grandfather , received equal praise . He was a strong contender for that year 's National Film Award for Best Actor , but eventually lost to Kamal Haasan . At the 35th National Film Awards , the film won in two categories – Best Feature Film in Tamil , and Best Actress for Archana . The film was among the 16 films to be screened at the Indian Panorama section of the International Film Festival of India in 1988 . In 2002 , the film was screened at the " Indian Summer " section of the Locarno International Film Festival . In a 2013 review , '' Ananda Vikatan '' called '' Veedu '' to be among the two films that took Tamil cinema to world cinema level . Further , it praised the film for highlighting the plight of Indian middle-class families and the political set up of the nation . It stated '' Veedu '' was one of the few Tamil films that scores good on both content and narration , and also appreciated Balu Mahendra 's directorial skills . Critics praised the film for being more visual and Balu Mahendra 's understanding of cinema as a visual medium . However , the magazine criticised the usage of background score in the film as it felt it lessened the impact of an otherwise good film . S. Theodore Baskaran in his '' The Eye of The Serpent : An Introduction To Tamil Cinema '' states that '' Veedu '' was a " striking departure " from the previous films of Balu Mahendra , as it was devoid of commercial elements like dance , songs , fight and comedy sequences . While analysing Archana 's characterisation , Baskaran noted Balu Mahendra 's penchant for strong characterisation of his female leads . Balu Mahendra had to construct a house which was mean to be a set for the house which was shown in the film . The building which was later fully constructed , now houses the film school started by Balu Mahendra in 2007 . In many interviews , Balu Mahendra had claimed that '' Veedu '' and '' Sandhya Raagam '' were the only films that satisfied him the most as he made these two the least number of mistakes and compromises . The film is widely considered to be one of the finest works of Balu Mahendra . The negative of the film is lost

		CONTEXT=Although Greece had been granted a spot in the 2008 final because of its seventh-place finish at the Eurovision Song Contest 2007 , it had to compete in a semi-final for the first time since 2004 because of new rules put into effect by the European Broadcasting Union ( EBU ) . In previous years , countries that received a top 10 placing were automatically granted a spot in the next year 's final without having to compete in a semi-final , but for 2008 , the EBU changed the automatic qualification regulations so that all countries except the " Big 4 " ( France , Germany , Spain , and the United Kingdom ) and host country , would have to pass through one of two semi-finals . The EBU split up countries with a friendly voting history into separate semi-finals , to give a better chance for other countries to win . Greece and Cyprus had often been accused of favoring each other , with each awarding the other the maximum number of points ( twelve ) at the previous contest . On January 28 , 2008 , the EBU held a special draw which determined that Greece would be in '' Semi-final 1 '' held on May 20 , 2008 in Belgrade , Serbia ; Cyprus was subsequently placed in the second semi-final

		CONTEXT=jurors of the Eurovision Song Contest 2009 play a large role in the voting process of the Contest . For the final round , each country 's votes will be decided by a combination of 50 % televoting by the public and 50 % by national jury . The method of selecting the semi-final qualifiers will remain the same as in past years , however , with nine countries in each semi-final which qualified based on the televoting results , and a tenth coming from the juries . In response to some broadcasters ' continued complaints about politically charged , neighbourly and diaspora voting , the European Broadcasting Union ( EBU ) evaluated the voting procedure used in the contest , and contemplated a change for 2009 . Contest organisers sent a questionnaire regarding the voting system to participating broadcasters , and a reference group incorporated the responses into their suggestions for next year 's format . Telewizja Polska ( TVP ) , the Polish broadcaster , suggested that an international jury similar to the one used in the 2008 Eurovision Dance Contest be introduced in the Eurovision Song Contest to lessen the impact of neighbourly voting and place more emphasis on the artistic value of the song . A jury would lead to less political and diaspora voting as the jury members , mandated to be music industry experts , would also have a say in addition to " random members of the public " . National juries were originally phased out of the contest beginning in 1997 , with televoting becoming mandatory for nearly all participants since 2003

		CONTEXT=Performances earned rave reviews from critics and publications , who praised D'Angelo 's energy and " charisma as a live performer " , as well as the Soultronics group , and received comparisons to outings by the legendary funk bands Parliament and Sly & the Family Stone . Tanya Bell of '' The Gazette '' wrote that the group " displayed enormous talent as it took them two hours to play 11 songs . " A staff writer for the '' Chicago Defender '' lauded his performance at the Chicago Theatre , calling it " an explosive mixture of R&B , soul and funk . " '' Rolling Stone '' called him " abundantly gifted , eye-poppingly spectacular " , " confident and worldly " in his performance at the House of Blues in Los Angeles . It compared the performance to his past concerts , stating " he 's alive onstage now , dancing , touching the audience , slamming his microphone down , lying on the ground at the lip of the stage to sing ' One Mo ' Gin ' while girls grab his legs , his stomach , his crotch . " In a review of D'Angelo 's tour-opening performance at the House of Blues , David Wollock of '' The Hollywood Reporter '' called it a " three-hour old-school soul marathon that was part ' Get Up ( I Feel Like Being a ) Sex Machine ' , part ' Let 's Get It On ' , part ' Move on Up ' gospel exuberance ... with call-and-response and other crowd-rousing church conventions " . He added that , " like the best hip-hop emcees who can rock a crowd with two turntables and a microphone , D moved the crowd with pure voice and charisma . " Kaia Shivers of the '' Los Angeles Sentinel '' commented that his Los Angeles tour stop placed the city " under a spell that it seems hard pressed to shake . " Reviewing his March performance at New York City 's Radio City Music Hall , rock critic Robert Christgau dubbed D'Angelo " R&B Jesus " and proclaimed himself a " believer " . Christgau praised D'Angelo 's delivery and compared the concert to a 1981 P-Funk outing at the Apollo Theater , stating " D'Angelo sang and danced and preached and flexed and crooned and humped the floor and covered Roberta Flack and snapped a mike stand in two and danced and sang and sang some more . Everything meshed ; all stops were pulled out . It was already the greatest concert I 'd seen in years when Redman and Method Man propelled the climactic ' Left and Right ' through the vaulted ceiling . I flashed on P-Funk 's ' Sadie ' , Apollo 1981 . What a privilege to experience such a thing again . " He also compared it to Marvin Gaye in concert , writing that " I saw Marvin Gaye at this venue shortly before he was murdered , and it was no contest . Gaye was fine , but self-indulgent and riddled with blank spots . "

QUERY_CONTEXT=Duane Allman created the idea of having two lead guitarists , which was inspired by Curtis Mayfield ; " he wanted the bass , keyboards , and second guitar to form patterns behind the solo rather than just comping , " said Allman . Their style and incorporation of guitar harmonies was very influential on later musicians . " The pair also had a wide range of complementary techniques , often forming intricate , interlocking patterns with each other and with the bassist , Berry Oakley , setting the stage for dramatic flights of improvised melodies . " Dickey Betts ' playing was very melody-based ; " My style is just a little too smooth and round to play the blues stuff straight , because I 'm such a melody guy that even when I 'm playing the blues , I go for melody first , " he said . His listening of country and string bluegrass growing up influenced this considerably : " I played mandolin , ukulele , and fiddle before I ever touched a guitar , which may be where a lot of the major keys I play come from . " He later characterized their style as " question and answer , anticipation and conclusion , " which involved allowing each musician 's downbeat to arrive in a different spot , while also keeping consideration of the bass guitar lines . The group also held an improvisational approach to live performances , which connected the band with jam band culture . " Jazz and blues musicians have been doing this for decades , but I think they really brought that sense that anyone onstage can inspire anyone else at any given time to rock music , " said Haynes . " We sure did n't set out to be a " jam band " but those long jams just emanated from within the band , because we did n't want to just play three minutes and be over , " said Allman . '' Rolling Stone '' referred to the group as " without question the first great jam band , and they took the jam to heights that it had not previously reached . " The Allman Brothers Band were considerably influential within the Southern United States . Their arrival on the musical scene paved the way for several other notable Southern rock bands — among those Lynyrd Skynyrd , the Marshall Tucker Band and Wet Willie — to achieve commercial success , and also " almost single-handedly " made Capricorn Records into " a major independent label . " Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top , writing for '' Rolling Stone '' , wrote that the group " defined the best of every music from the American South in that time . They were the best of all of us . " He went on to call the band " a true brotherhood of players — one that went beyond race and ego . It was a thing of beauty . " The band 's extended popularity through heavy touring in the early 1990s created a new generation of fans , one that viewed the Allmans as pioneers of " latter-day collegiate jam rock . " AllMusic praised the band 's history : " they went from being America 's single most influential band to a shell of their former self trading on past glories , to reach the 21st century resurrected as one of the most respected rock acts of their era . " In 2012 , an official historic marker was erected on the site of the July 1970 Second Atlanta International Pop Festival near Byron , Georgia . The Allman Brothers Band had played two sets at the festival , which was a significant event in their career . The marker text reads , in part : " Over thirty musical acts performed , including ... Macon 's Allman Brothers Band on their launching pad to national fame . " Official sponsors of the marker included the Georgia Allman Brothers Band Association , The Allman Brothers Band Museum at the Big House , and '' Hittin ' the Note '' . In 2003 , the band released a recording of their festival opening and closing performances , '' Live at the Atlanta International Pop Festival : July 3 & 5 , 1970 ''

		CONTEXT=In a positive review for '' Cuepoint '' , Robert Christgau argued that while Azalea may never demonstrate a powerful , soulful , or attractively melodic delivery , her " striving Australian-Atlantan cadence " is original and carries every song . He deemed ' ' The New Classic '' " plenty authentic -- and damn good to boot " while dismissing Azalea 's media naysayers : " predictably , the songs where she expresses wonderment that ' Impossible Is Nothing ' are more relatable than the ones where she flaunts her liquid assets . But the ones where she pledges to keep on striving are more relatable than that , because striving is built into her flow itself . That 's what her complexity is about . " Phil Johnson from '' The Independent '' called it " an instantly engaging showcase of the 23-year-old Aussie 's talents – poppy without diluting her fierce-flowing charisma . " Kellan Miller of '' XXL '' said despite some poor songs near the end of the record , it is " a persuasive indicator that Iggy Azalea will be around for the long haul . " '' The New Classic '' was named one of the best hip-hop albums of the year by '' XXL '' on a list published on 30 June 2014 , adding that " the album proved to a gang of skepts who doubted Iggy 's controversial style from the start that she was more than capable of making hip-hop tracks with a pop appeal . " It was placed at number twenty-five on Digital Spy 's top albums of 2014 and listed among Fuse 's 40 best albums of 2014 . The album won the Breakthrough Artist Release award at the 2014 ARIA Music Awards and Favorite Rap/Hip-Hop Album at the 2014 American Music Awards , beating out Drake 's '' Nothing Was the Same '' and Eminem 's '' The Marshall Mathers LP 2 '' . It received a nomination for Best Rap Album at the 57th Grammy Awards . The album was also up for Top Rap Album at the 2015 Billboard Music Awards

QUERY_ANSWERS={'Caltavuturo massacre'}
QUERY_CONTEXT=According to many scholars , the name and origin of the town are traced back to the period of Arab rule . According to Ibn al-Athir ( '' The Complete History '' , VII .370.5 – 7 ) , in AH 268 ( 881/82 CE ) , the Aghlabid commander Abū Ṯawr was defeated by the Byzantines ( probably commanded by the '' strategos '' Mosilikes ) and his was army annihilated , with only seven men surviving . The locality was later named in Arabic '' Qalʿat Abī Ṯawr '' ( " Castle of Abū Ṯawr " ) , which is the origin of the modern name . Others instead maintain that the name derives from the Arabic word " qal ' at " ( fortress ) and the Sicilian " vuturu " ( vulture ) meaning of " fortress of vultures . " The town existed under Byzantine rule pre Arab conquest as Aziz Ahmad in “ A Islamic History of Sicily ” ( edinburgh university press 1975 ) states that in 852 Abbas raided Caltavuturo in the northern part of the Island and took many prisoners who were sold as slaves , The town was the site of the so-called Caltavuturo massacre on 20 January 1893 , when local authorities killed 13 and wounded 21 peasants that had occupied communal land that they claimed was theirs

		CONTEXT=After the 1920 Arab riots and 1921 Jaffa riots , the Jewish leadership in Palestine believed that the British ( whom the League of Nations had given a mandate over Palestine in 1920 for the purpose of establishing a Jewish national home ) had no desire to confront local Arab gangs over their attacks on Palestinian Jews . Realizing that they could not rely on the British administration for protection from these gangs , the Jewish leadership created the Haganah to protect their farms and Kibbutzim . In addition to guarding Jewish communities , the role of the Haganah was to warn the residents of and repel attacks by Palestinian Arabs . In the period between 1920 – 1929 , the Haganah lacked a strong central authority or coordination . Haganah " units " were very localized and poorly armed : they consisted mainly of Jewish farmers who took turns guarding their farms or their kibbutzim . Following the Arab massacres of 1929 , the Haganah 's role changed dramatically . It became a much larger organization encompassing nearly all the youth and adults in the Jewish settlements , as well as thousands of members from the cities . It also acquired foreign arms and began to develop workshops to create hand grenades and simple military equipment , transforming from an untrained militia to a capable underground army

QUERY_CONTEXT=The Germans now took over the Italian zone , and soon proved to be a totally different opponent from the demoralized , war-weary and far less brutal Italians . Already since the early summer of 1943 , German troops had been pouring into Greece , fearing an Allied landing there ( in fact falling victims to a grand-scale Allied strategic deception operation , " Operation Barclay " ) . Soon they became involved in wide-ranging counterguerrilla operations , which they carried out with great ruthlessness , based on their experiences in Yugoslavia . In the course of these operations , mass reprisals were carried out , resulting in war crimes such as at Kommeno on August 16 , the Massacre of Kalavryta in December and the Massacre of Distomo in June 1944 .

		CONTEXT=Kleisoura ( , also Βλαχοκλεισούρα , '' Vlachokleisoúra '' ; ) is a traditionally Aromanian ( Vlach ) settlement and a former municipality in Kastoria regional unit , West Macedonia , Greece . Since the 2011 local government reform , it is part of the municipality of Kastoria , of which it is a municipal unit . The municipal unit has an area of 37.069 km2 . Population 259 ( 2011 ) . On 5 April 1944 , the German occupation forces under the command of Karl Schümers , commander of the 7th regiment of the 4th Armored Division of the SS , the same unit to later that year commit the massacre in Distomo , slaughtered the women and children of Kleisoura in retaliation for the execution of three German soldiers by ELAS close to the village . The ELAS guerrillas , led by Alexis Rosios from Siatisti ( " Captain Ypsilantis " ) , who were active in the region , had attacked a German military phalanx at Daouli , close to Kleisoura , and had killed a vanguard of three motorcyclists . According to testimonies , the male residents , fearing retaliation , fled to the mountains surrounding the village . After finding the mutilated bodies of the Wehrmacht soldiers close to the local church , the German SS unit went to the homes , broke the doors of the majority of the houses , shot the people within , set fire to the buildings and also killed whom they found in the streets . Altogether 270 residents were killed , the overwhelming majority of them being women , children and elderly people . Involved in the atrocities was also a Bulgarian militia under German command , led by Andon Kalchev . Colonel Karl Schümers was summoned by the German administration for having ordered the slaughter of women and children . He testified that his soldiers were forced to kill the civilians because rebel forces were hiding and firing through the village , whereupon he was acquitted , despite the contradictory statements of his subordinates . After the war it was proved that his testimony was false

Van Munster has stated that it is " not likely " he will pull the show from future Emmy awards , considering that it reflects on his and his crew 's hard work and high standards .

QUERY_CONTEXT=Gibson became involved in politics as a member of the Whig Party with strong anti-slavery views . During the U.S. Presidential campaign of 1844 , he gave stump speeches for Henry Clay due to the Whig Party 's platform that opposed admitting Texas into the Union because it was a slave state . In the U.S. Presidential campaign of 1848 , Gibson supported Whig candidate , " Rough and Ready " General Zachary Taylor . However , he was concerned about the Whig Party 's lack of opposition to the abolition of slavery and personally visited Henry Clay at his home in Ashland , Kentucky in 1848 to discuss this issue . He lost as a Whig candidate for Ohio Attorney General in 1853 . In 1853 , following the large defeat of the Whig candidate General Winfield Scott in the U.S. Presidential election of 1852 , Gibson threw his support to the Free Soil Party and began organizing what would become the Republican Party in Ohio . He attended the first organization meeting of the Republican Party in spring of 1856 in Pittsburgh . He was one of the 69 Ohio delegates ( of a total 600 delegates from around the country ) that attended the first Republican National Convention held in Philadelphia in June 1856 . In 1856 , he ran and was elected as the first Republican to hold the office of Ohio State Treasurer

Resolved , That foregoing all former differences of opinions upon other questions , we pledge ourselves to unite in opposition to the present administration of the Government ; that under the Constitution Congress possesses the power to prohibit slavery in the Territories ; and that , whilst we will maintain all constitutional rights of the South , we also hold that justice , humanity , the principles of freedom as expressed in our Declaration of Independence and our national constitution , and the purity and perpetuity of our Government require that that power shall be exerted to prevent the extension of slavery into territory heretofore free . Resolved , That the repeal of the Missouri Compromise was unwise and injurious ; an open and aggravated violation of the plighted faith of the States , and that the attempt of the present administration to force slavery into Kansas against the known wishes of the legal voters of that Territory is an arbitrary and tyrannous violation of the rights of the people to govern themselves , and that we will strive by all constitutional means to secure to Kansas and Nebraska the legal guaranty against slavery of which they were deprived at the cost of the violation of the plighted faith of the nation . Resolved , That we are devoted to the Union and will , to the last extremity , defend it against the efforts now being made by the dis-unionists of this administration to compass its dissolution , and that we will support the Constitution of the United States , in all its provisions regarding it , as the sacred bond of our Union and the only safeguard for the preservation of the rights of ourselves and our posterity .

		CONTEXT=He arrived at the club as an incredibly shy and underdeveloped personality , a fact that was noted by teammate Trent Cotchin who said though Martin was 18 “ he seemed much younger in some of the ways he behaved . ” Indeed , he struggled initially to adjust to the expectations of professional football . In one incident in the 2010 preseason he was removed from training and verbally reprimanded by club leadership when he was deemed unfit to train after a big night out . Despite these struggles , his on-field development was such that he would still debut in the 2010 season 's opening match , a 56-point Richmond loss against at the MCG . Martin recorded the sixth most disposals of any Tiger ( 18 ) to go along with four marks , three tackles and three clearances . Two weeks later Martin was convicted by the AFL tribunal for a high hit on Sydney 's Josh Kennedy in round 3 . He did not receive a suspension for the incident however , returning to football the following week . After four matches Martin ranked fourth in the league for clearances and eighth for hard-ball gets . Media reports emerged after round 8 that the 18 year old Martin had received a significant contract offer from expansion club the Greater Western Sydney Giants . The offer , which the Herald Sun ’s Mark Robinson claimed to be worth $ 2.4 million over three seasons , would have taken effect in the new club 's first AFL season in 2012 . Martin later said he had never entertained the idea of moving to the start-up club . In round 10 he had gained attention for his on-field efforts again , this time being nominated for the 2010 AFL Rising Star award after a 21 disposal and 11 clearance match against Port Adelaide . Due to his previous tribunal conviction however , Martin was ruled ineligible for the award and thus did not officially place in the end of season award 's points tally . He drew the attention of Sydney coach Paul Roos by round 14 , prompting Roos to send veteran Brett Kirk onto Martin in a tagging role . Despite this extra attention , he still managed to record 18 disposals and a goal in the match at the MCG . After 17 rounds Martin ranked second at the club for clearances and inside 50s as well as third for disposals and contested possessions . At the same time he ranked first among that season 's Rising Star nominees in clearances , contested possessions and inside 50s . He was also fourth for average disposals and fifth for average tackles . In round 19 he was rested by the club before returning to play out the final five matches of the season . He missed just that one game in his debut season and finished the year ranked second at Richmond for clearances and inside 50s , as well as third for both contested possessions and disposals . In addition to winning the Fred Swift Medal for fourth place at the club 's best and fairest night , Martin also received six votes in the Brownlow Medal count that year , the most by any Richmond debutant since Craig Lambert in 1988 . At season 's end he reiterated his commitment to the club ( and rejection of the former GWS overtures ) by signing a two-year contract extension that would keep him at Richmond until the end of the 2013 season . The extension was reported by the Herald Sun to be in the vicinity of $ 400,000-a-year

In one incident in the 2010 preseason he was removed from training and verbally reprimanded by club leadership when he was deemed unfit to train after a big night out . Despite these struggles , his on-field development was such that he would still debut in the 2010 season 's opening match , a 56-point Richmond loss against at the MCG . Martin recorded the sixth most disposals of any Tiger ( 18 ) to go along with four marks , three tackles and three clearances . Two weeks later Martin was convicted by the AFL tribunal for a high hit on Sydney 's Josh Kennedy in round 3 . He did not receive a suspension for the incident however , returning to football the following week . After four matches Martin ranked fourth in the league for clearances and eighth for hard-ball gets . Media reports emerged after round 8 that the 18 year old Martin had received a significant contract offer from expansion club the Greater Western Sydney Giants . The offer , which the Herald Sun ’s Mark Robinson claimed to be worth $ 2.4 million over three seasons , would have taken effect in the new club 's first AFL season in 2012 . Martin later said he had never entertained the idea of moving to the start-up club . In round 10 he had gained attention for his on-field efforts again , this time being nominated for the 2010 AFL Rising Star award after a 21 disposal and 11 clearance match against Port Adelaide . Due to his previous tribunal conviction however , Martin was ruled ineligible for the award and thus did not officially place in the end of season award 's points tally . He drew the attention of Sydney coach Paul Roos by round 14 , prompting Roos to send veteran Brett Kirk onto Martin in a tagging role . Despite this extra attention , he still managed to record 18 disposals and a goal in the match at the MCG . After 17 rounds Martin ranked second at the club for clearances and inside 50s as well as third for disposals and contested possessions . At the same time he ranked first among that season 's Rising Star nominees in clearances , contested possessions and inside 50s . He was also fourth for average disposals and fifth for average tackles . In round 19 he was rested by the club before returning to play out the final five matches of the season . He missed just that one game in his debut season and finished the year ranked second at Richmond for clearances and inside 50s , as well as third for both contested possessions and disposals . In addition to winning the Fred Swift Medal for fourth place at the club 's best and fairest night , Martin also received six votes in the Brownlow Medal count that year , the most by any Richmond debutant since Craig Lambert in 1988 . At season 's end he reiterated his commitment to the club ( and rejection of the former GWS overtures ) by signing a two-year contract extension that would keep him at Richmond until the end of the 2013 season . The extension was reported by the Herald Sun to be in the vicinity of $ 400,000-a-year

		CONTEXT=Justin Timberlake and Chris Stapleton first collaborated at the 2015 Country Music Association Awards , performing " Tennessee Whiskey " and " Drink You Away " . Stapleton was initially only writing songs with Timberlake for the album , before being asked to sing on " Say Something " . He told '' Billboard '' , " I really just went out to Los Angeles to write songs with him , it 's a very fluid process with him , there 's a lot going on . That was one of those things where there was n't necessarily a plan . He was like ' All right , you hop in there and take a verse , ' and I 'm like , ' You want me to do what ? ' ... It came out great . I had a blast with him , he 's a great creative force and one of those guys that if you get a chance to work with him , you should . " " Say Something " is an upbeat country rock ballad that blends the electronic structures of '' Man of the Woods '' previously released songs " Filthy " and " Supplies " with Stapleton 's country blues styles . The song comprises elements of gospel , pop , acoustic soul and jazz . Timberlake and Timbaland previously incorporated country sounds such as twangy guitars on tracks like " What Goes Around ... Comes Around " . The song features lyrics about reflection and regret , meditating on social pressure to have something to say and being unsure if you really do . '' Nashville Scene '' writer Stephen Trageser interpreted the lyrics as : Directed by Arturo Perez Jr. and produced by La Blogothèque , the video was filmed using a technique known as " continuous motion " and shot in one take at the Bradbury Building in Los Angeles – famous for its appearance in the 1982 cult science fiction film '' Blade Runner '' – with elevators , balconies , and stairs that " personified the labyrinth " the concept required . The crew included 17 musicians and a 60-person choir , in order to record the video and audio live in only one take . The video starts with Timberlake alone in a room creating beats and effects on an MPC sampler . The camera follows him as he straps on an acoustic guitar and ascends up an elevator . Stepping out , he encounters Stapleton on a nearby staircase . The music video on YouTube has received over 315 million views as of July 2019 .

		CONTEXT=These departures and injuries left Dayton with arguably the most limited roster , in both depth and physical size , in Division I . The Flyers played the bulk of their season with only six players who started the season on scholarships . In January 2015 , Bobby Wehrli , who had begun the season as a walk-on , was given a scholarship , but only for the spring of 2015 . No one left on the active roster , whether on scholarship or not , was taller than 6 ' 6 " ( 1.98 m ) . CBS Sports journalist Gary Parrish had this to say about the Flyers ' roster limitations ( emphasis in original ) : " To put this into perspective , consider that Kentucky has '' seven '' scholarship players taller than '' 6-8 '' , and that UK 's starting '' backcourt '' ( Andrew Harrison and Aaron Harrison ) is just as tall as Dayton 's starting '' frontcourt '' ( Dyshawn Pierre and Kendall Pollard ) . " Despite these limitations , the Flyers remained in contention for the A10 title for most of the season , ultimately finishing second in the regular-season standings , and advanced to the A10 Tournament final , losing there to VCU

		CONTEXT=Lyrically , " Roman 's Revenge " has been described as " unrelenting " , " bonkers " , " angry " and " outrageous " . Critics found Minaj 's lyrics as intense and incisive , but Eminem 's rap has been noted as being similar to his earlier work and contains misogyny and homophobia . Many critics questioned Minaj 's alter-ego , Roman Zolanski , as being an " angry gay male " because it was expected that the rappers would go toe-to-toe in-between verses . The song makes references to Disney 's Princess Jasmine and Aladdin , iPods , and New York Giant Eli Manning as well as the song " Scenario " by A Tribe Called Quest , the latter of which is referenced through the line " Rawr , rawr like a dungeon dragon " which is taken from Busta Rhymes ' verse in " Scenario . " David Jeffries of '' AllMusic '' called the song the key track of the album , referring to Minaj as a savage as she " roars like a tiger " while standing up to Eminem . Brad Wete of '' Entertainment Weekly '' called the song " merciless " , as Nicki/Roman tears into the song with lyrics firing at whoever they are meant to be fired at . Alexis Petridis of '' The Guardian '' praised the song 's eerie and vulgar tone , referring to Minaj 's tone of voice as " thrilling , quivering & edge-of-panic . " Margaret Wappler of '' Los Angeles Times '' complemented Minaj 's " huffing and puffing " at Eminem 's alter-ego , while both characters exchange violent lyrics . Praising the song as the main track of the album , Scott Plagenhoef of '' Pitchfork Media '' complimented the song as aggressive and pointed out Eminem 's use of " recycling his Shady-circa-99 persona . " Jesse Cataldo of '' Slant '' dissected the track while attempting to understand Roman Zolanski as a " less carefully identified sliver of herself than the embodiment of what makes her appealing . " Cataldo additionally added that the song gets " violently up in your face . " However , other critics dismissed and negatively reviewed the anti-gay slurs rapped by guest-feature Eminem . '' Idolator '' positively reviewed the song as an " experiment , " while praising the verses of Minaj while dismissing Eminem 's " typical misogyny and homophobia . " Marc Hogan of '' Spin '' praised the song for noting Minaj 's capabilities to " compete with the big boys " in rap . He noted that Eminem and Minaj trade verses over " pulsating Swizz Beatz strings " . Although Eminem makes a " killer blow " with an anti-gay slur on gay-friendly Minaj 's track " , Minaj retaliates with " outlandish British accent . " Zach Baron and Rich Juzwiak of '' The Village Voice '' both debated on the track , praising it as well as dismissing the anti-gay lyrics by Eminem . Zach Baron praised Minaj for upstaging Eminem by stating that the guest-feature deserved to be shown up by Minaj as she additionally add 's more character into the song with additional voice-changes . Rich Juzwiak approached the song as the gay-male-alter-ego Roman Zolanski verses the anti-gay Slim Shady , and praised Minaj/Zolanski for " winning the battle . " Juzwiak later questioned Minaj 's alter-ego Roman as an " angry gay-male , " stating that Roman 's character should have gone ahead with knocking Eminem for his past " anti-gay-epithet , " and his ' piss-on-women misogyny . " Many critics considered the song a " diss " towards Lil ' Kim , who has been in disputes with Minaj since the beginning of her career . Mariel Concepcion of '' Billboard '' dissected the song stating " Nicki Minaj 's highly-talked about " Roman 's Revenge " track hit the net over the weekend , and the Harajuku Barbie appears to be taking jabs at Lil ' Kim . " In the first verse Minaj takes shots saying " '' Look at my show footage how these girls be spazzing/So fuck I look like getting back to a has-been/Yeah I said it has-been/hang it up/flatscreen '' " then again " '' You out of work/I know it 's tough/but enough is enough '' / " Minaj then specifically takes jabs at Baltimore rapper Keys and Lil ' Kim in the second verse rapping , " '' Is this the thanks that I get for putting you bitches on / is it my fault that all of you bitches gone '' / " and following this line this inferred she was talking about Lil ' Kim " '' Nicki she just mad cause you took the spot / word that bitch mad cause I took the spot / Well bitch if you aint shitting then get off the pot/Got some niggas out in Brooklyn that 'll off ya top '' / . Minaj also subliminally took jabs at rapper Keys with " '' I see them dusty ass Filas , Levi 's / Raggedy Ann 's / Holes in your knee highs '' " . Lil ' Kim fired back at the song at a club-concert , stating " I will erase this bitch ’s social security number . First of all , I do n’t even need a record right now and I ’d kill that bitch with my old shit . My records ai n’t just enter the charts , they made history . What the fuck is this bullshit , this shit come and go ! " Minaj later stated in an interview on '' The Wendy Williams Show '' that , " They know what I 'm talking about . See that 's the thing when you put out records ; you know only the ' guilty ones ' feel like you 're talking about them . So you know , if you have nothing to worry about , if you have n't came out saying stuff , if you never came out saying your ungrateful bullshit then you would n't worry about it . " In response to " Roman 's Revenge " , Lil ' Kim released " Black Friday " which debuted on DJ Absolut ’s Hot 97 show on Thanksgiving Day . The song samples Pharoahe Monch ’s instrumental from “ Simon Says " and takes lyrical jabs at Minaj , stating " This ai n’t a championship fight , I been the greatest / See the fact is , what you doing , I did it / Lames tryna clone my style and run wit it / That ’s cool , I was the first one wit it / You ’s a Lil ’ Kim wannabe , you just hate to admit it . ” Minaj performed the song live during '' VH1 's Diva 's Support the Troops '' for the men and women of the military . The song was accompanied by other singles from the rapper 's debut album and " Girls Just Wan na Have Fun " with Katy Perry . After winning the MTV Video Music Award for Best Hip-Hop Video at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards , she said that " The new album is going to have a lot of Roman on it ... And if you 're not familiar with Roman , then you will be familiar with him very soon . He ’s the boy that lives inside of me . He 's a lunatic and he 's gay and he 'll be on there a lot .

The racy lyrics center around Rowland asking her man to use his hands all over her body , and are accompanied by a " synth-saturated beat " produced by Jonsin . In terms of instruments , " Motivation " uses sparse keyboard notes , programmed beats and pulsing synths in the chorus . Wayne adds a rap verse complementing Rowland 's seductive suggestions , using the kitchen and a car as metaphors for sex . According to Scott Shetler from AOL Music , Rowland uses the lyrics to promise " to be her lover 's motivation . " Rowland called the record a mixture between dance and mash-up . When asked by MTV what Rowland thought of the song , she said , " It has that personality and characteristic to it that I do n't think anybody can deny . That 's why when Wayne dropped that insane verse on there ... I was like , ' You really brought that up even more . ' He went into the studio and just did it . I do n't think it takes much for Wayne to think . He just does it . He 's so admirable . " Ryan Brockington , from the '' New York Post , '' was amongst the first to review " Motivation .

		SCORE=2.8680550485660206e-06
		CONTEXT=Safety has long been a concern in the mining business , especially in sub-surface mining . The Courrières mine disaster , Europe 's worst mining accident , involved the death of 1,099 miners in Northern France on March 10 , 1906 . This disaster was surpassed only by the Benxihu Colliery accident in China on April 26 , 1942 , which killed 1,549 miners . While mining today is substantially safer than it was in previous decades , mining accidents still occur . Government figures indicate that 5,000 Chinese miners die in accidents each year , while other reports have suggested a figure as high as 20,000 . Mining accidents continue worldwide , including accidents causing dozens of fatalities at a time such as the 2007 Ulyanovskaya Mine disaster in Russia , the 2009 Heilongjiang mine explosion in China , and the 2010 Upper Big Branch Mine disaster in the United States . Mining has been identified by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ( NIOSH ) as a priority industry sector in the National Occupational Research Agenda ( NORA ) to identify and provide intervention strategies regarding occupational health and safety issues . The Mining Safety and Health Administration ( MSHA ) was established in 1978 to " work to prevent death , illness , and injury from mining and promote safe and healthful workplaces for US miners . " Since its implementation in 1978 , the number of miner fatalities has decreased from 242 miners in 1978 to 28 miners in 2015

QUERY_CONTEXT=And Japan was eager to take every opportunity . In 1869 they took advantage of the defeat of the rebels of the Republic of Ezo to incorporate definitely the island of Hokkaido to Japan . For centuries , Japan viewed the Ryukyu Islands as one of its provinces . In 1871 the Mudan incident happened : cannibal Taiwanese aborigines murdered 54 Ryūkyūan sailors that had their ship shipwrecked . At that time the Ryukyu Islands were claimed by both Qing China and Japan , and the Japanese interpreted the incident as an attack on their citizens . They took steps to bring the islands in their jurisdiction : in 1872 the Japanese Ryukyu Domain was declared , and in 1874 a retaliatory incursion to Taiwan was sent , which was a success . The success of this expedition emboldened the Japanese : not even the Americans could defeat the Taiwanese cannibals in the Formosa Expedition of 1867 . Very few gave it much thought at the time , but this was the first move in the Japanese expansionism series . Japan occupied Taiwan for the rest of 1874 and then left owing to Chinese pressures , but in 1879 it finally annexed the Ryukyu Islands . In 1875 Qing China sent a 300-men force to subdue the Taiwanese cannibals , but unlike the Japanese the Chinese were routed , ambushed and 250 of their men were killed ; the failure of this expedition exposed once more the failure of Qing China to exert effective control in Taiwan , and acted as another incentive for the Japanese to annex Taiwan .

		CONTEXT=And Japan was eager to take every opportunity . In 1869 they took advantage of the defeat of the rebels of the Republic of Ezo to incorporate definitely the island of Hokkaido to Japan . For centuries , Japan viewed the Ryukyu Islands as one of its provinces . In 1871 the Mudan incident happened : cannibal Taiwanese aborigines murdered 54 Ryūkyūan sailors that had their ship shipwrecked . At that time the Ryukyu Islands were claimed by both Qing China and Japan , and the Japanese interpreted the incident as an attack on their citizens . They took steps to bring the islands in their jurisdiction : in 1872 the Japanese Ryukyu Domain was declared , and in 1874 a retaliatory incursion to Taiwan was sent , which was a success . The success of this expedition emboldened the Japanese : not even the Americans could defeat the Taiwanese cannibals in the Formosa Expedition of 1867 . Very few gave it much thought at the time , but this was the first move in the Japanese expansionism series . Japan occupied Taiwan for the rest of 1874 and then left owing to Chinese pressures , but in 1879 it finally annexed the Ryukyu Islands .

		CONTEXT=The ACCAR alternative to the hemispherical cruising altitude rules , if adopted in 1997 , could have eliminated the navigation paradox at all altitudes , and could have saved 342 lives in over 30 midair collisions ( up to November 2006 ) since Patlovany 's risk analysis proves that the current regulations increase the risk of a midair collision in direct proportion to pilot compliance . The Namibian collision in 1997 , the Japanese near-miss in 2001 , the Überlingen collision in Germany in 2002 , and the Amazon collision in 2006 , are all examples where human or hardware errors doomed altitude-accurate pilots killed by the navigation paradox designed into the current cruising altitude rules . The current system as described by Paielli noted as examples of other safety critical systems , nuclear power plants and elevators are designed to be passively safe and fault tolerant . The navigation paradox describes a midair collision safety system that by design can not tolerate a single failure in human performance or electronic hardware

		CONTEXT=According to the ITAR-TASS news agency , the prosecution stated that Khabarov 's group planned to launch an operation codenamed “ Dawn ” to overthrow official authorities in the region . Many prominent figures in Russian politics expressed outrage about Khabarov 's imprisonment . Among them are individuals with diametrically opposed political views such as the presidential candidates Leonid Ivashov and Gennady Zyuganov , as well as other political figures , such as Andrey Illarionov , Andrey Savelyev , Maxim Shevchenko , Alexey Dymovsky , Maxim Kalashnikov , Irek Murtazin , Mikhail Delyagin , Ashot Egiazaryan , Aleksandr Kharchikov , Dmitry Puchkov , '' et al. '' They said that the accusations do not hold water , pointing to the ridiculousness of the collected “ evidence ” against Khabarov . Khabarov 's colleague , Col. Vladislav Zyomkovsky , said during an interview with '' PublicPost '' , that officially announced denunciation of a failed masterplan doesn ′ t stand up to critical examination , and if examined , the argument simply falls to the ground . In his opinion , a brilliant military strategist such as Khabarov , would never develop such an obvious plan . To refute the official version of the failed plot , Zyomkovsky cited one paragraph from Khabarov 's bill of indictment , which states that Khabarov and his alleged accomplices planned to switch off the entire region 's electrical grid , and thus create panic and civil disorder . In his opinion , this passage was copypasted from an indictment of the criminal trials of the 1930s , when such an event would really have spread chaos . But in the 2000s in Russia , electrical outages happened on a daily basis , were routine and a quite common occurrence

		CONTEXT=These departures and injuries left Dayton with arguably the most limited roster , in both depth and physical size , in Division I . The Flyers played the bulk of their season with only six players who started the season on scholarships . In January 2015 , Bobby Wehrli , who had begun the season as a walk-on , was given a scholarship , but only for the spring of 2015 . No one left on the active roster , whether on scholarship or not , was taller than 6 ' 6 " ( 1.98 m ) . CBS Sports journalist Gary Parrish had this to say about the Flyers ' roster limitations ( emphasis in original ) : " To put this into perspective , consider that Kentucky has '' seven '' scholarship players taller than '' 6-8 '' , and that UK 's starting '' backcourt '' ( Andrew Harrison and Aaron Harrison ) is just as tall as Dayton 's starting '' frontcourt '' ( Dyshawn Pierre and Kendall Pollard ) . " Despite these limitations , the Flyers remained in contention for the A10 title for most of the season , ultimately finishing second in the regular-season standings , and advanced to the A10 Tournament final , losing there to VCU

		CONTEXT=When Jackson left the role in 1999 , a recast was opposed by viewers and costars . When Jackson 's departure had previously been rumored in 1996 , Anthony Geary ( Luke ) told '' TV Guide '' that he " went to ( the '' GH '' powers ) and said , ' If we lose him , then let 's kill Lucky . ' Jonathan is too much a part of us to replace him . " Geary repeated these sentiments when Jackson confirmed leaving in 1999 . When a recast was rumored in early 2000 , Jackson stated : " When all the actors who are going to be working with the character do n't want it , it 's kind of too bad that they still do it . But I do n't really get surprised with a lot of things that they do . " The role was recast with Jacob Young , and by the time he appeared on-screen in February 2000 , the character had been off-screen for almost a year , speculated to be an attempt to ease the transition between actors due to Jackson 's popularity . Young was able to become accepted by fans ; in 2001 , Candace Havens wrote in '' The Free Lance – Star '' : " His hard work has paid off and many fans ca n't even remember there was ever someone else in the role . " Young was named Sexiest Soap Star by '' People '' magazine in 2001 . In 2002 , Young won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actor . Greg Vaughan , who took over the role from 2003 to 2009 , was the only portrayer of Lucky not to be nominated for an Emmy award . However , Vaughan did have a fan following . He was chosen by ABC Daytime and SOAPnet to participate in their 2008 Hot Guys Calendar , featuring popular male costars from ABC soap operas . At the start of 2008 , '' Zap2it '' named Vaughan No. 6 on their Top 10 Most Improved list , stating : " The gorgeous Mr. Vaughan plays angry and sexy very well . Thank goodness we 're getting to see it . " During Vaughan 's tenure , Lucky entered into a relationship with Sam McCall ( Kelly Monaco ) that was popular with fans . '' Zap2it '' named them No. 6 on their list of Top Couples of 2007 , and tied them for No. 3 in 2008 along with entangled couple Elizabeth ( Herbst ) and Jason Morgan ( Steve Burton ) , stating : " Lucky and Sam were conceived out of a revenge plot , yet quickly surprised fans and execs alike with their instant chemistry . Is the Quad in for another partner-switching shake-up in 2009 ? " When Vaughan left in 2009 , he reflected on his reception : " I am grateful as to how the fans embraced me , whether they liked me or not . It was my job to win them over and I did that in due time . " Some felt Vaughan was not a good fit for the character . In April 2008 , Allison Waldman of '' The Huffington Post '' named Jackson as one of the top ten actors to make an impact on '' General Hospital '' , stating : " He 's still the real Lucky to many people , even though two other actors have subsequently played the part . " When Jackson was hired to reprise the role in 2009 , his return was highly anticipated , but accompanied by controversy as Vaughan was let go in order to bring Jackson back . Fans had a bittersweet reaction to the switch . The network promoted Jackson 's return with the phrase , " Elizabeth 's first love is back ! " , which angered some of Vaughan 's fans . However , ratings rose the week Jackson returned , and his performance was well received . Jackson was nominated for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series in 2010 , only having been with the show for three months of 2009 . Jackson 's return changed the dynamic of the Elizabeth and Nikolas affair storyline , which had a negative reception from fans who thought it did not align with the history between Herbst and Jackson . The scenes in early 2010 where Lucky confronts Elizabeth and Nikolas about their affair received praise . That April , '' We Love Soaps '' named Jackson No. 26 of the top 50 Greatest Soap Actors , Damon L. Jacobs commenting : " From that first scene as Lucky in the Canadian diner , to his recent scenes of betrayal railing against Elizabeth and Nikolas , Jonathan adds a profound depth and spiritual gravity to the scripted words that is far beyond his years . His piercing bloodshot eyes shoot daggers far more deadly than Sonny 's guns , and his smile encapsulates all that was celebrated about Luke and Laura 's connection . " Michael Logan of '' TV Guide '' named Jackson the best actor of 2010 , referencing the affair confrontation when stating : Jackson submitted those scenes for the 38th Daytime Emmy Awards , where he won his fourth Daytime Emmy Award and first win as Outstanding Supporting Actor . The scenes were compared to classics such as Judith Light 's performance of Karen Wolek 's courtroom confession scene on '' One Life to Live '' and Kim Zimmer ’s performance of Reva Shayne 's fountain scene on '' Guiding Light '' . Jackson 's on-screen chemistry with Erin Chambers ( Siobhan ) also had a positive reception at the end of 2010 . However the following year they were rated the No. 6 Worst Soap Opera Couple of 2011 by '' Zap2it '' , who stated : " We spent 2011 desperately clinging to those few early memories , as Siobhan transformed from an appealing character into a shrill , insecure harpy ( ... ) Try as Jackson and Chambers might , the actors were unable to salvage an ounce of their prior appeal as a couple . " On the other hand , the entertainment website named Jackson No. 3 of the Top 10 Male Entertainers that year . Jackson had a range of emotional work in 2011 that received acclaim , including the scenes following the death of Lucky 's son Jake , a storyline met by criticism by some fans . In 2012 , Jackson won his fifth Daytime Emmy Award for his scenes where Lucky tells Luke that Luke was the driver that hit Jake and confronts him about his drinking . When Jackson was nominated , '' On-Air On-Soaps '' stated :

		CONTEXT=Later in 1979 , Sellers starred opposite Shirley MacLaine , Melvyn Douglas and Jack Warden in the black comedy '' Being There '' as Chance , a simple-minded gardener addicted to watching TV who is regarded as a sage by the rich and powerful . In a BBC interview in 1971 , Sellers had said that more than anything else , he wanted to play the role , and successfully persuaded the author of the book , Jerzy Kosinski , to allow him and director Hal Ashby to make the film , provided Kosinski could write the script . During filming , to remain in character , Sellers refused most interview requests and kept his distance from the other actors . Sellers considered Chance 's walking and voice the character 's most important attributes , and in preparing for the role worked alone with a tape recorder or with his wife , and then with Ashby , to perfect the clear enunciation and flat delivery needed to reveal " the childlike mind behind the words " . Sellers described his experience of working on the film as " so humbling , so powerful " , and co-star Shirley MacLaine found Sellers " a dream " to work with . Sellers 's performance was universally lauded by critics and is considered by critic Danny Smith to be the " crowning triumph of Peter Sellers 's remarkable career " . Critic Frank Rich wrote that the acting skill required for this sort of role , with a " schismatic personality that Peter had to convey with strenuous vocal and gestural technique ... A lesser actor would have made the character 's mental dysfunction flamboyant and drastic ... His intelligence was always deeper , his onscreen confidence greater , his technique much more finely honed " : in achieving this , Sellers " makes the film 's fantastic premise credible " . The film earned Sellers a Best Actor award at the 51st National Board of Review Awards ; the London Critics Circle Film Awards Special Achievement Award , the Best Actor award at the 45th New York Film Critics Circle Awards ; and the Best Actor – Musical or Comedy award at the 37th Golden Globe Awards .

		CONTEXT=Performances earned rave reviews from critics and publications , who praised D'Angelo 's energy and " charisma as a live performer " , as well as the Soultronics group , and received comparisons to outings by the legendary funk bands Parliament and Sly & the Family Stone . Tanya Bell of '' The Gazette '' wrote that the group " displayed enormous talent as it took them two hours to play 11 songs . " A staff writer for the '' Chicago Defender '' lauded his performance at the Chicago Theatre , calling it " an explosive mixture of R&B , soul and funk . " '' Rolling Stone '' called him " abundantly gifted , eye-poppingly spectacular " , " confident and worldly " in his performance at the House of Blues in Los Angeles . It compared the performance to his past concerts , stating " he 's alive onstage now , dancing , touching the audience , slamming his microphone down , lying on the ground at the lip of the stage to sing ' One Mo ' Gin ' while girls grab his legs , his stomach , his crotch . " In a review of D'Angelo 's tour-opening performance at the House of Blues , David Wollock of '' The Hollywood Reporter '' called it a " three-hour old-school soul marathon that was part ' Get Up ( I Feel Like Being a ) Sex Machine ' , part ' Let 's Get It On ' , part ' Move on Up ' gospel exuberance ... with call-and-response and other crowd-rousing church conventions " . He added that , " like the best hip-hop emcees who can rock a crowd with two turntables and a microphone , D moved the crowd with pure voice and charisma . " Kaia Shivers of the '' Los Angeles Sentinel '' commented that his Los Angeles tour stop placed the city " under a spell that it seems hard pressed to shake . " Reviewing his March performance at New York City 's Radio City Music Hall , rock critic Robert Christgau dubbed D'Angelo " R&B Jesus " and proclaimed himself a " believer " . Christgau praised D'Angelo 's delivery and compared the concert to a 1981 P-Funk outing at the Apollo Theater , stating " D'Angelo sang and danced and preached and flexed and crooned and humped the floor and covered Roberta Flack and snapped a mike stand in two and danced and sang and sang some more . Everything meshed ; all stops were pulled out . It was already the greatest concert I 'd seen in years when Redman and Method Man propelled the climactic ' Left and Right ' through the vaulted ceiling . I flashed on P-Funk 's ' Sadie ' , Apollo 1981 . What a privilege to experience such a thing again . " He also compared it to Marvin Gaye in concert , writing that " I saw Marvin Gaye at this venue shortly before he was murdered , and it was no contest . Gaye was fine , but self-indulgent and riddled with blank spots . "

		CONTEXT=On 4 October 2009 , Fred Halliday , Emeritus Professor of International Relations at the LSE and the School 's leading expert on the Middle East , wrote a memorandum to the LSE Council regarding the proposed cooperation with the Gaddafi Foundation . " I have repeatedly expressed reservations about formal educational and funding links with that country . " While those in favour of accepting the donation argued that " Libya is changing internally , " most informed observers agree that while some of the worst excesses for the moment have ceased , the rights of its people are badly protected . Libya " remains a country run by a secretive , erratic and corrupt elite . " Since 9/11 the Libyan government has reached compromises with the West on a number of issues , notably the Lockerbie bombing and nuclear weapons . Yet tactical changes in foreign policy are not sufficient for the purposes of evaluating political and academic links . There are also ways in which Libyan foreign policy has '' not '' changed : the country continues to call for the destruction of Israel ; Muammar Gaddafi recently called for the abolition of Switzerland , and he receives the leader of the Somali pirates operating off the Horn of Africa as honoured guests of state . Moreover , Libya 's handling of the Lockerbie bombing " has not been characterised by either consistency or clarity , " I have in the past , Halliday noted , defended accepting grants from authoritarian regimes such as the Gulf states , " but there should be clear limits on this , depending on the degree of political and human rights abuses perpetrated with them and on their ongoing foreign policy conduct . " Whitehall and the City are now happy to do business with Libya , but it does not follow that the LSE should do the same . Responsible leaders throughout the Middle East continue to express reservations regarding Libya , including " its more prominent ' liberal ' representatives . " We must remember , Halliday concluded , that the " liberal " wing within a regime such as Libya does not have the function of producing change but its role is instead " to reach compromises with internal hard-liners that serve to lessen external pressure . " A good case in point are the proposals LSE now is considering . It is , as LSE alumni in positions of responsibility in the region caution , " far too early for the School to take this step . " In 2009 , Human Rights Watch was allowed entry to Libya , via Saif al-Islam Gaddafi 's non-profit organization in order to gather facts about the human rights situation there . While HRW reported that there were concerns about the " repressive atmosphere , " they felt there were signs of " improvement " and Sarah Leah Whitson , director of HRW 's Middle East division said that one should not " underestimate the importance of the efforts made so far " by Gaddafi in the realm of human rights in Libya . She also wrote of her official visit that " the real impetus for the transformation rests squarely with a quasi-governmental organization , the Qaddafi Foundation for International Charities and Development " chaired by Gaddafi . She praised Gaddafi for establishing the country 's two semi-private newspapers , and said " it is impossible to underestimate the importance of the efforts made so far . Let 's hope this spring will last . " In January 2011 , HRW criticised other organisations as well as governments that had previously dealt with Gaddafi . HRW Business and Human Rights Director Arvind Ganesan condemned the London School of Economics ( LSE ) for allowing " abusive and corrupt officials or their families to launder their images in exchange for money " . This was later followed by Ganesen saying that " the London School of Economics did not act until Saif al-Islam 's father literally began to kill his own people " . According to NGO Monitor , this was despite the fact that David Held , Co-Director of LSE Global Governance , was partially influenced by Whitson 's remarks regarding her Libyan visit , referring to Saif al-Islam Gaddafi as a reformer

He claimed that he would take a " new and effective " approach to a crisis and that " The Army is informed of who the insurgents are and will carry out their duties . " On 1 September 2006 , a day after 22 commercial banks were simultaneously bombed in Yala Province , Sonthi announced that he would break with the government 's no-negotiation policy . However , he noted that " We still do n't know who is the real head of the militants we are fighting with . " In a press conference the next day , he attacked the government for criticising him for trying to negotiate with the anonymous insurgents , and demanded that the government " Free the military and let it do the job . " His confrontation with the government made his call for negotiation extremely popular with the media . Afterwards , insurgents bombed six department stores in Hat Yai city , which until then had been free of insurgent activities . The identity of the insurgents was not revealed . Sonthi was granted an extraordinary increase in executive powers to combat unrest in the far south . By 19 September 2006 ( after Sonthi overthrew the Thai government ) , the army admitted that it was still unsure who to negotiate with . On March 2005 , respected former Prime Minister Anand Panyarachun was appointed chairman of a National Reconciliation Commission , tasked with overseeing the restoration of peace to the south . A fierce critic of the Thaksin-government , Anand frequently criticised the handling of southern unrest , and in particular the State of Emergency Decree . He has been quoted to have said , " The authorities have worked inefficiently . They have arrested innocent people instead of the real culprits , leading to mistrust among locals .

		CONTEXT=Jasser has said that he and his family have helped build a number of small mosques in different cities using locally raised funds , and at times encountering , but always overcoming local opposition . In 2010 Jasser strongly opposed the building of the Park51 project , a 13-story Islamic community center and mosque two blocks from the World Trade Center site , which is also known as Ground Zero . He said he was concerned that the funding of the $ 100 million project might be coming from foreign Islamist sources , and also said : " Ground Zero is purely about being American . It can never be about being Muslim . " Jasser believes acts of Islamic terrorism are rooted in the ideology of political Islam or Islamism . He has expressed the opinion that the 2009 Christmas Day attempted airplane bombing , the 2009 Fort Hood shooting , and the 2010 Times Square car bombing attempt have not prodded the United States into the appropriate action , but rather have resulted in politically correct denial by U.S. government authorities , and inaction by most American Muslims . He believes that even the Bush administration took inadequate measures against Islamism in America . He says the U.S. needs to provide alternatives for Muslim youth and promote reformist groups . In his television appearances , Jasser has claimed that 3 to 5 percent of U.S. Muslims are militant and 30 to 40 percent do not believe in separation of mosque and state . He also states that he believes many Western Muslim imams are too timid in their response to Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant seemingly both criticizing but also sympathizing with its goal of a caliphate stating " Clearly , the majority of the mosques in the United States are led by imams who are Islamists — who believe that in Muslim-majority countries that the state should be identified as an Islamic state . " Jasser is an outspoken supporter of Israel and believes that Muslim organizations and leaders need to be held to a litmus test to see whether they recognize Israel as a state . Jasser and a group of American Muslims founded the nonprofit American Islamic Forum for Democracy ( AIFD ) in 2003 with the goal of demonstrating the compatibility of Islam with democracy and American values . Jasser is the group 's president and chief spokesman . The AIFD supports separation of religion and state , religious pluralism , equality of the sexes , the unconditional recognition of Israel , and the creation of an independent Palestine " on the current ' occupied territories .

		CONTEXT=By May 2009 , '' The Tree of Life '' had been sold to a number of international distributors , including Europacorp in France , TriPictures in Spain , and Icon in the UK and Australia , but lacked a US distributor . In August 2009 , it was announced that the film would be released in the US through Apparition , a new distributor founded by River Road Entertainment head Bill Pohlad and former Picturehouse chief Bob Berney . A tentative date of December 25 , 2009 was announced , but the film was not completed in time . Organisers of the Cannes Film Festival made negotiations to secure a premiere at Cannes 2010 , resulting in Malick sending an early version of the film to Thierry Fremaux and the Cannes selection committee . Though Fremaux warmly received the cut and was eager to screen the film at his festival , Malick ultimately told him that he felt the film was not ready . On the eve of the 2010 Cannes Film Festival , Berney suddenly announced his departure from Apparition , leaving the company 's future uncertain . Pohlad decided to keep '' The Tree of Life '' at Apparition , and after significant restructuring , hired Tom Ortenberg to act as a consultant on its release . A tentative plan was made to release it in late 2010 , in time for awards consideration . Ultimately , Pohlad decided to close Apparition and sell rights to the film . Private screenings of the film to interested parties Fox Searchlight Pictures and Sony Pictures Classics took place at the 2010 Telluride Film Festival . On September 9 , Fox Searchlight announced their acquisition of the film from Pohlad 's River Road Entertainment . The film opened in limited release in the United States on May 27 , 2011
