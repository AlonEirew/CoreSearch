QUERY_ANSWERS={'Johnstown Flood of 1977', 'massive flood', '1977 flood'}
QUERY_CONTEXT=The flood was preceded by rains from March 9 that did not stop until March 22 , 1936 . The storms brought warmer 50 °F ( 10 °C ) weather that was a cause of one stage of flooding and the continuous rains a second cause of flooding . The natural run-off of 1 to 3 inches ( 2.5 to 7.5 cm ) was far surpassed by the deluge of from 10 to 30 inches ( 25 to 75 cm ) of water in the region . The flood came before pending flood control legislation was enacted or any significant flood control measures implemented . The narrowness of the valleys and encroachment of buildings on the river banks contributed to record flooding . By the time nightfall came one-third of the city was under of water and by the time flooding was over twenty-five people lost their lives . The damages , estimated at $ 43 million , made it the worst flood since the flood of 1889 and the event is chronicled at the Johnstown Flood Museum After the flood , sweeping nationwide flood control laws were enacted and from 1938 to 1943 Johnstown saw many projects completed . These measures gave the people the feeling that the area was now " flood free " , and it was touted as such until the flood of 1977

		CONTEXT=In 2012 , Mirren played Alfred Hitchcock 's wife Alma Reville in the 2012 biopic '' Hitchcock '' , directed by Sacha Gervasi and based on Stephen Rebello 's non-fiction book '' Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho '' . The film centres on the pair 's relationship during the making of '' Psycho '' , a controversial horror film that became one of the most acclaimed and influential works in the filmmaker 's career . It became a moderate arthouse success and garnered a lukewarm critical response from critics , who felt that it suffered from " tonal inconsistency and a lack of truly insightful retrospection . " Mirren was universally praised for her play however , with Roger Ebert noting that the film depended most on her portrayal , which he found to be " warm and effective . " Her other film that year was '' The Door '' , a claustrophobic drama film directed by István Szabó , based on the Hungarian novel of the same name . Set at the height of communist rule in 1960s Hungary , the story of the adaptation centres on the abrasive influence that a mysterious housekeeper wields over her employer and successful novelist , played Martina Gedeck . Mirren found the role " difficult to play " and cited doing it as " one of the hardest things she has ever done . " The following year , Mirren replaced Bette Midler in David Mamet 's biographical television film '' Phil Spector '' about the American musician . The HBO film focuses on the relationship between Spector and his defense attorney Linda Kenney Baden , played by Mirren , during the first of his two murder trials for the 2003 death of Lana Clarkson in his California mansion . '' Spector '' received largely mixed to positive reviews from critics , particularly for Mirren and co-star Al Pacino 's performances , and was nominated for eleven Primetime Emmy Awards , also winning Mirren a Screen Actors Guild Award at the 20th awards ceremony . The film drew criticism both from Clarkson 's family and friends , who charged that the suicide defense was given more merit than it deserved , and from Spector 's wife , who argued that Spector was portrayed as a " foul-mouthed megalomaniac " and a " minotaur " . Also in 2013 , Mirren voiced the character of Dean Abigail Hardscrabble in Pixar 's computer-animated comedy film '' Monsters University '' , which grossed $ 743 million against its estimated budget of $ 200 million , and reprised her role in the sequel film '' Red 2 '' . The action comedy received a mixed reviews from film critics , who called it a " lackadaisical sequel " , but became another commercial success , making over $ 140 million worldwide

His internationalist dogma , with distinct echoes from Judaism and Jewish ethics , was first shaped during World War I , when Relgis was a conscientious objector . Infused with anarcho - pacifism and socialism , it provided Relgis with an international profile , and earned him the support of pacifists such as Romain Rolland , Stefan Zweig and Albert Einstein . Another , more controversial , aspect of Relgis ' philosophy was his support for eugenics , which centered on the compulsory sterilization of " degenerates " . The latter proposal was voiced by several of Relgis ' essays and sociological tracts .

QUERY_CONTEXT=In the 1959 review for '' Sight & Sound '' , David Vaughan calls '' Gigi '' " an elegant film " with a " cultivated visual taste which is everywhere apparent " . He summarises that " while '' Gigi '' does not represent a revival of the MGM musical in its heyday , it is a welcome extension of latter-day musical style in its adult subject-matter and its avoidance of spectacle made vulgar by emphasis on size . " He praises Minnelli 's talent for " the delicious amorality of the anecdote , but also the honesty and irony of its telling which have become foreign to the American cinema . " Vaughan points out " Chevalier 's practiced but irresistible charm as one of the film 's greatest assets " as well as " the brilliant high-comedy playing of Isabel Jeans , who as Aunt Alicia consummately portrays the distinction and beauty of a retired aristocrat of the '' demimonde '' . " Bosley Crowther of '' The New York Times '' called it " a musical film that bears such a basic resemblance to '' My Fair Lady '' that the authors may want to sue themselves " . He added , " But do n't think this point of resemblance is made in criticism of the film , for '' Gigi '' is a charming entertainment that can stand on its own two legs . It is not only a charming comprehension of the spicy confection of Colette , but it is also a lovely and lyrical enlargement upon that story 's flavored mood and atmosphere … Vincente Minnelli has marshaled a cast to give a set of performances that , for quality and harmony , are superb . " Abel Green of '' Variety '' called the film " 100 % escapist fare " and predicted it " is destined for a global box-office mop-up " . He added , " Alan Jay Lerner 's libretto is tailor-made for an inspired casting job for all principals , and Fritz Loewe 's tunes ( to Lerner 's lyrics ) already vie with and suggest their memorable '' My Fair Lady '' score … Miss Caron is completely captivating and convincing in the title role … Skillful casting , performance and presentation have endowed realism to the sum total … Director Minnelli 's good taste in keeping it in bounds and the general sound judgment of all concerned … distinguishes this Arthur Freed independent production . The Metrocolor rates recognition for its soft pastels under Joseph Ruttenberg 's lensing ; the Beaton costumes , sets and general production design are vivid physical assets at first sight . The skillful integration of words-and-music with the plot motivation makes this '' Gigi '' a very fair lady indeed as a boxoffice entry . " '' Time Out New York '' said , " The dominating creative contribution comes from Minnelli and Cecil Beaton … The combination of these two visual elitists is really too much — it 's like a meal consisting of cheesecake , and one quickly longs for something solid and vulgar to weigh things down . No doubt inspired by the finicky , claustrophobic sets and bric-à-brac , the cast tries ( with unfortunate success ) to be more French than the French , especially Chevalier . The exception is Gingold , who inhabits , as always , a world of her own . " '' TV Guide '' rated the film 3 ½ out of five stars , calling it " Overbaked but enjoyable , and a banquet for the eyes , thanks to the visual wonder of the Minnelli-Beaton teaming … Caron … leads the cast in a contest to see who can be the most French . The winner is Chevalier , in a performance that makes one feel as if you 're gagging on pastry … Perhaps if the sweetness of '' Gigi '' was contrasted with elements of honest vulgarity , the picture could balance itself out … Ten minutes into the movie , you 've resolved the plot and are left to wallow in lovely frou-frou . The film makes wonderful use of the usual Parisian landmarks , and benefits from extraordinary period costumes and sets . " '' Gigi '' won a record-breaking nine Academy Awards ( at the 1959 Oscars ceremony ) ; however , this record only lasted for one year , as '' Ben-Hur '' broke this record the following year with 11 Oscars . In tribute to '' Gigi '' s domination of the Oscars , the MGM switchboard answered calls the following day with " M-Gigi-M " . '' Gigi '' , eventually along with 1987 's '' The Last Emperor '' , held the record as the film ( s ) with the most Academy Award wins in every category in which it was nominated , until 2003 's '' The Lord of the Rings : The Return of the King '' broke the record at the 2004 Oscars ceremony with 11 Oscar nominations and 11 Oscar wins

		CONTEXT=Some media outlets received the broadcast positively . '' St. Louis Post-Dispatch '' television critic Gail Pennington praised Stewart 's performance as host writing that he " did the Oscars proud Sunday night , turning in a four-star hosting performance that unfortunately made the rest of the show seem sluggish by comparison . " Film critic Roger Ebert said that Stewart was " on target , topical and funny , " and added , " He was as relaxed , amusing and at home as Johnny Carson . " Columnist Ray Richmond of '' The Hollywood Reporter '' commented , " He seemed at times nervous and self-conscious , but on the whole , Stewart delivered with just the right balance of reverence and smugness . " Others media publications were more critical of the show . Television critic Rob Owen of the '' Pittsburgh Post-Gazette '' wrote that Stewart was more " amusing than funny " . He added , " Many of his jokes fell flat with the stars in the Kodak Theatre , and his tendency to bow down before celebrities quickly grew tiresome . " Tom Shales from '' The Washington Post '' commented , " It 's hard to believe that professional entertainers could have put together a show less entertaining than this year 's Oscars , hosted with a smug humorlessness by comic Jon Stewart , a sad and pale shadow of great hosts gone by . " Moreover , he derided the " piles and piles and miles and miles of clips from films present and past " writing that it " squandered the visual luster " of the ceremony . Associated Press television critic Frazier Moore remarked , " Stewart , usually a very funny guy , displayed a lack of beginner 's luck as first-time host ... His usually impeccable blend of puckishness and self-effacement fell flat in the service of Oscar . " He also criticized the decision to play music over the winner 's acceptance speeches calling it " distracting and obnoxious . " The American telecast on ABC drew in an average of 38.94 million people over its length , which was an 8 % decrease from the previous year 's ceremony . Additionally , the show earned lower Nielsen ratings compared to the previous ceremony with 23.0 % of households watching over a 35 share . Furthermore , it garnered a lower 1849 demo rating with a 13.9 rating among viewers in that demographic

QUERY_CONTEXT=Approximately five thousand of the nine thousand surviving Italian soldiers were executed in reprisal by the German forces . The book '' Corelli 's Mandolin '' , by Louis de Bernieres ( which was later made into the film ' Captain Corelli 's Mandolin ' ) , is based on this story . While the war ended in central Europe in 1945 , Cephalonia remained in a state of conflict due to the Greek Civil War . Peace returned to Greece and the island in 1949 . Cephalonia lies just to the east of a major tectonic fault , where the European plate meets the Aegean plate at a slip boundary . This is similar to the more famous San Andreas Fault . There are regular earthquakes along this fault

		CONTEXT=In May 1943 the division transferred for garrison duties to the Greek island of Cefalonia . After Italy 's surrender to the Allies on 3 September 1943 the divisions commanding general Antonio Gandin was left without clear orders from his superiors . Therefore , Gandin decided to let his soldiers vote on 13 September 1943 as to what to do to next . The troops voted overwhelmingly to fight their former allies the Germans , thus the '' Acqui '' became one of the very few Italian units to actively resist the Germans . The Germans therefore summarily executed over half of the divisions soldiers and all of its officers in revenge during the Massacre of the Acqui Division

		CONTEXT='' The Philadelphia Inquirer '' published a review by Carrie Rickey , who wrote , " Under the obvious influence of Francis Ford Coppola , Bouchareb frames his shadow-ridden guerrilla heroes as the Algerian counterparts of the Corleones " , referring to the American film '' The Godfather '' , and further that '' Outside the Law '' owes " an enormous debt to Jean-Pierre Melville 's '' Army of Shadows '' ( 1969 ) , about French resistance fighters one-minded in their goal to subvert Nazis " . Rickey wrote , " Bouchareb is sometimes a little too one-minded : His movie might have been richer emotionally had he written scenes showing the characters ' domestic lives and not strictly their professional spheres . " Stephen Holden of '' The New York Times '' called '' Outside the Law '' a " didactic , unashamedly manipulative film " , and also saw parallels to '' The Godfather '' and '' Army of Shadows '' : " Those are mighty shoes to fill , and as powerful and well-made as it is , '' Outside the Law '' is too schematic and single-minded to lodge itself in your mind as a fully realized cinematic epic . Its few female characters are sketchy at best . " Before the film premiered , already it was met by political controversy and nationalist-oriented criticism in France . Lionnel Luca , a member of the National Assembly for the UMP , appealed for a review by the Defence Historical Service as soon as he heard about the project . Guy Pervillé deplored the inevitable acceptance by moviegoers of the film as representing historical truth . The Defence Historical Service claimed that " the errors and anachronisms are so many and so gross that they can be identified by any historian ... The numerous improbabilities present in the scenario show that the writing of the latter was not preceded by a serious historical study . " The center of the controversy was the depiction of the 1945 Sétif massacre early in the film . The report elaborated , " The director wants to suggest that on May 8 , 1945 , Muslims in Sétif were blindly massacred by Europeans , whereas it 's the contrary that transpired . ... A ll historians agree that ... Europeans lashed out against Muslims in response to Muslims massacring Europeans . " This reaction is at odds with mainstream history , which concluded that , after restoring order in the town , French military and police then carried out a series of reprisals and summary executions of native civilians . Before even seeing the film , Luca also criticized the decision to give public funding to a film which he considered " anti-French " . Mustapha Orif , one of the film 's co-producers , responded to the accusations and defended the film 's portrayal of the massacre . " Rachid Bouchareb interviewed many people , witnesses and historians . From this point of view , I do not think at all that he has deviated from historical reality , " he said

This status was reflected in the quality of the equipment they were issued and their retention of police insignia and rank structure . The division was transferred to the Waffen-SS in 1942 and was upgraded to a '' Panzergrenadier '' division .

Her visual resources include mirrors , still photography , video , dance , and films within the film , all employed with a bold and surprising inventiveness " by the catalogue notes of the 1978 Los Angeles International Film Exposition . Similarly , critic Alison Butler wrote that the " film is a witty and visually brilliant essay on gender and experience , culture and environment " and program notes used by the San Francisco Cinematheque during a screening quote critic Amy Taubin as opining that the film " makes you reconsider what you and everyone else is doing — in life and in art " and critic Steve Anker underscoring that it is an important " crossover film " combining " avant-garde and theatrical sensibilities , made during the mid-1970s . It chronicles the nightmarish breakdown of a fashion photographer as she confronts her waning identity and security as a career woman ; blending narrative experimentation , fantasy , fact and theoretical critique , it has enormous impact on independent features which followed it . " PopMatters noted that the film has " enough originality to nag at patient viewers and get at least partially under our skin " and critic Michael Atkinson wrote that it is a " weird , restless , beguilingly offbeat bit of dreamwork . " The film was presented for the first time at the Berlin International Film Festival in 1977 , it has won a Special Jury Prize at the Venice Film Festival and was recently called " seminal " during a screening at a repertory cinema , " a strong and humoristic showdown " at another and " a sonically-complex , montage-rich , darkly funny and uriniferous cornerstone of avant-garde cinema " during a screening at a New York University class . Critic Peter Hajek wrote in the Austrian newspaper '' Kurier '' that " Valie Export presents this psychopanoptic view of the present in solid , striking images and often in unexpected humorous passages . " Critic Chris Holmlund , author of the scholarly article " Feminist Makeovers : The Celluloid Surgery of Valie Export and Su Friedrich , " referred to '' Invisible Adversaries '' as a feminist version of '' Invasion of the Body Snatchers '' , noted that the film includes references to famous paintings and to '' Un Chien Andalou '' , and wrote that therefore it " is visually rick , entertaining , striking , but also demanding . " A few reviews , however , were negative . For example , London 's '' Time Out '' wrote about the film that it is " n ot unlike '' W.R. : Mysteries of the Organism '' " and that it will " probably age as badly " and a reviewer for '' The Heights '' wrote that " I was expecting a great feminist work here , but got mediocrity . I can not recommend that you see this film , " though he nevertheless praised the film as a " cornucopia of video spectacle in which Export delights , confounds and amuses the audience with her antics .

		CONTEXT=When Jackson left the role in 1999 , a recast was opposed by viewers and costars . When Jackson 's departure had previously been rumored in 1996 , Anthony Geary ( Luke ) told '' TV Guide '' that he " went to ( the '' GH '' powers ) and said , ' If we lose him , then let 's kill Lucky . ' Jonathan is too much a part of us to replace him . " Geary repeated these sentiments when Jackson confirmed leaving in 1999 . When a recast was rumored in early 2000 , Jackson stated : " When all the actors who are going to be working with the character do n't want it , it 's kind of too bad that they still do it . But I do n't really get surprised with a lot of things that they do . " The role was recast with Jacob Young , and by the time he appeared on-screen in February 2000 , the character had been off-screen for almost a year , speculated to be an attempt to ease the transition between actors due to Jackson 's popularity . Young was able to become accepted by fans ; in 2001 , Candace Havens wrote in '' The Free Lance – Star '' : " His hard work has paid off and many fans ca n't even remember there was ever someone else in the role . " Young was named Sexiest Soap Star by '' People '' magazine in 2001 . In 2002 , Young won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actor . Greg Vaughan , who took over the role from 2003 to 2009 , was the only portrayer of Lucky not to be nominated for an Emmy award . However , Vaughan did have a fan following . He was chosen by ABC Daytime and SOAPnet to participate in their 2008 Hot Guys Calendar , featuring popular male costars from ABC soap operas . At the start of 2008 , '' Zap2it '' named Vaughan No. 6 on their Top 10 Most Improved list , stating : " The gorgeous Mr. Vaughan plays angry and sexy very well . Thank goodness we 're getting to see it . " During Vaughan 's tenure , Lucky entered into a relationship with Sam McCall ( Kelly Monaco ) that was popular with fans . '' Zap2it '' named them No. 6 on their list of Top Couples of 2007 , and tied them for No. 3 in 2008 along with entangled couple Elizabeth ( Herbst ) and Jason Morgan ( Steve Burton ) , stating : " Lucky and Sam were conceived out of a revenge plot , yet quickly surprised fans and execs alike with their instant chemistry . Is the Quad in for another partner-switching shake-up in 2009 ? " When Vaughan left in 2009 , he reflected on his reception : " I am grateful as to how the fans embraced me , whether they liked me or not . It was my job to win them over and I did that in due time . " Some felt Vaughan was not a good fit for the character . In April 2008 , Allison Waldman of '' The Huffington Post '' named Jackson as one of the top ten actors to make an impact on '' General Hospital '' , stating : " He 's still the real Lucky to many people , even though two other actors have subsequently played the part . " When Jackson was hired to reprise the role in 2009 , his return was highly anticipated , but accompanied by controversy as Vaughan was let go in order to bring Jackson back . Fans had a bittersweet reaction to the switch . The network promoted Jackson 's return with the phrase , " Elizabeth 's first love is back ! " , which angered some of Vaughan 's fans . However , ratings rose the week Jackson returned , and his performance was well received . Jackson was nominated for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series in 2010 , only having been with the show for three months of 2009 . Jackson 's return changed the dynamic of the Elizabeth and Nikolas affair storyline , which had a negative reception from fans who thought it did not align with the history between Herbst and Jackson . The scenes in early 2010 where Lucky confronts Elizabeth and Nikolas about their affair received praise . That April , '' We Love Soaps '' named Jackson No. 26 of the top 50 Greatest Soap Actors , Damon L. Jacobs commenting : " From that first scene as Lucky in the Canadian diner , to his recent scenes of betrayal railing against Elizabeth and Nikolas , Jonathan adds a profound depth and spiritual gravity to the scripted words that is far beyond his years . His piercing bloodshot eyes shoot daggers far more deadly than Sonny 's guns , and his smile encapsulates all that was celebrated about Luke and Laura 's connection . " Michael Logan of '' TV Guide '' named Jackson the best actor of 2010 , referencing the affair confrontation when stating : Jackson submitted those scenes for the 38th Daytime Emmy Awards , where he won his fourth Daytime Emmy Award and first win as Outstanding Supporting Actor . The scenes were compared to classics such as Judith Light 's performance of Karen Wolek 's courtroom confession scene on '' One Life to Live '' and Kim Zimmer ’s performance of Reva Shayne 's fountain scene on '' Guiding Light '' . Jackson 's on-screen chemistry with Erin Chambers ( Siobhan ) also had a positive reception at the end of 2010 . However the following year they were rated the No. 6 Worst Soap Opera Couple of 2011 by '' Zap2it '' , who stated : " We spent 2011 desperately clinging to those few early memories , as Siobhan transformed from an appealing character into a shrill , insecure harpy ( ... ) Try as Jackson and Chambers might , the actors were unable to salvage an ounce of their prior appeal as a couple . " On the other hand , the entertainment website named Jackson No. 3 of the Top 10 Male Entertainers that year . Jackson had a range of emotional work in 2011 that received acclaim , including the scenes following the death of Lucky 's son Jake , a storyline met by criticism by some fans . In 2012 , Jackson won his fifth Daytime Emmy Award for his scenes where Lucky tells Luke that Luke was the driver that hit Jake and confronts him about his drinking . When Jackson was nominated , '' On-Air On-Soaps '' stated :

		CONTEXT=From 2016 onwards , Y NOT Studios continued to contribute towards making " new wave films " in the Tamil film industry and experienced commercial success . The company collaborated with director Sudha Kongara , actor Madhavan , and debutante actress Ritika Singh to produce a bilingual sports drama film titled '' Irudhi Suttru '' ( 2016 ) in Tamil and '' Saala Khadoos '' ( 2016 ) in Hindi , which told the story of a boorish boxing coach taking on a rebellious young woman from a fishermen colony as his new student . With a publicity budget of 9 crore rupees , the promotions for the films were described by The Hindu to be " unlike other film promotions in the South " , considering that most film teams in the Tamil film industry do not usually tour around the state publicising their project . Before the release of the film , the team held several screenings to select Hindi and Tamil audiences and edited the film accordingly to the taste of the audiences . '' Irudhi Suttru '' opened to positive reviews , with a critic from Sify.com stating that the film was " a perfect sports drama , which should not be missed " and added that " this inspirational effort has a superb screenplay with all the typical elements of a good sports film in place " , while Rediff.com agreed that the film was " not to be missed " , adding " its refreshing characters , enjoyable plot , great music and visuals keeps you hooked " . Following the success of the film , Sudha Kongara remade the film in the Telugu language as '' Guru '' ( 2017 ) with Venkatesh in the lead role alongside Ritika Singh . '' Irudhi Suttru '' was later screened at the 29th Tokyo International Film Festival during October 2016 and was then also selected to be a part of the Indian Panorama section at 47th International Film Festival of India . It went on to win a National Film Award for Ritika Singh ; three Filmfare Awards for Best Director , Actor and Actress ; as well as Best Picture at the South Indian International Movie Awards and the IIFA Utsavam

		CONTEXT=Marc Lamont Hill , a professor at Columbia University , compared the fugitive ex – Los Angeles police officer Christopher Dorner to a real-life Django , saying " It 's almost like watching ' Django Unchained ' in real life . It 's kind of exciting . " Writing in the '' Los Angeles Times '' , journalist Erin Aubry Kaplan noted the difference between Tarantino 's '' Jackie Brown '' and '' Django Unchained '' : " It is an institution whose horrors need no exaggerating , yet '' Django '' does exactly that , either to enlighten or entertain . A white director slinging around the n-word in a homage to '70s blaxploitation à la '' Jackie Brown '' is one thing , but the same director turning the savageness of slavery into pulp fiction is quite another . " While hosting NBC 's '' Saturday Night Live '' , Jamie Foxx joked about being excited " to kill all the white people in the movie " . Conservative columnist Jeff Kuhner wrote a reaction to the '' SNL '' skit for '' The Washington Times '' , saying : " Anti-white bigotry has become embedded in our postmodern culture . Take '' Django Unchained '' . The movie boils down to one central theme : the white man as devil — a moral scourge who must be eradicated like a lethal virus . " Samuel L. Jackson told Vogue Man that " '' Django Unchained '' was a harder and more detailed exploration of what the slavery experience was than '' 12 Years a Slave '' , but director Steve McQueen is an artist and since he 's respected for making supposedly art films , it 's held in higher esteem than '' Django '' , because that was basically a blaxploitation movie . " Some reviews criticized the film for being too violent . The originally planned premiere of '' Django '' was postponed following the Sandy Hook school shooting on December 14 , 2012 . Thomas Frank criticized the film 's use of violence as follows : Not surprisingly , Quentin Tarantino has lately become the focus for this sort of criticism ( about the relationship between the movies and acts of violence ) . The fact that '' Django Unchained '' arrived in theaters right around the time of the Sandy Hook massacre did n't help . Yet he has refused to give an inch in discussing the link between movie violence and real life . Obviously I do n't think one has to do with the other . Movies are about make-believe . It 's about imagination . Part of the thing is trying to create a realistic experience , but we are faking it . Is it possible that anyone in our cynical world credits a self-serving sophistry like this ? Of course an industry under fire will claim that its hands are clean , just as the NRA has done – and of course a favorite son , be it Tarantino or LaPierre , can be counted on to make the claim louder than anyone else . But do they really believe that imaginative expression is without consequence ? '' The Independent '' said the movie was part of " the new sadism in cinema " and added , " There is something disconcerting about sitting in a crowded cinema as an audience guffaws at the latest garroting or falls about in hysterics as someone is beheaded or has a limb lopped off "

A national final with four songs was held where the song " Everything " composed by Nikos Karvelas with lyrics by Vissi herself , was chosen as the Greek entry in March .

While her first performance was not a success , her second remains the highest placing that Cyprus has ever achieved in the Contest . Following Vissi 's later performance , she joined with Nikos Karvelas in an exclusive songwriting collaboration and with him they released an independent album in 1982 titled '' Eimai To Simera Kai Eisai To Hthes '' under their own label CarVi ( '' ' CAR '' ' velas '' ' VI '' ' ssi ) ; Vissi 's contract with Minos EMI did not allow for this and the album was deleted in a lawsuit in favor of Minos EMI , while Vissi then switched labels .

However , in honor of her third participation in the Eurovision Song Contest , Minos EMI released a limited edition double A-side single containing both tracks prior to the release of Vissi 's Eurovision entry for promotion . The songs were also released on a 2006 remastered edition of Vissi 's self-titled 1981 album , which was now titled '' 4 '' , on the count of it being her fourth studio album .

In previous years , countries that received a top 10 placing were automatically granted a spot in the next year 's final without having to compete in a semi-final , but for 2008 , the EBU changed the automatic qualification regulations so that all countries except the " Big 4 " ( France , Germany , Spain , and the United Kingdom ) and host country , would have to pass through one of two semi-finals . The EBU split up countries with a friendly voting history into separate semi-finals , to give a better chance for other countries to win . Greece and Cyprus had often been accused of favoring each other , with each awarding the other the maximum number of points ( twelve ) at the previous contest . On January 28 , 2008 , the EBU held a special draw which determined that Greece would be in '' Semi-final 1 '' held on May 20 , 2008 in Belgrade , Serbia ; Cyprus was subsequently placed in the second semi-final

The whole channel was even boycotted for a time by all kinds of Christian denominations due to " glorifying secularism and sacrilegious attitudes and spoiling the lives of young , innocent children and the youth of Finland " and the boycott was backed with the classic claims of backmasking having revealed hidden messages .

QUERY_CONTEXT=Although Greece had been granted a spot in the 2008 final because of its seventh-place finish at the Eurovision Song Contest 2007 , it had to compete in a semi-final for the first time since 2004 because of new rules put into effect by the European Broadcasting Union ( EBU ) . In previous years , countries that received a top 10 placing were automatically granted a spot in the next year 's final without having to compete in a semi-final , but for 2008 , the EBU changed the automatic qualification regulations so that all countries except the " Big 4 " ( France , Germany , Spain , and the United Kingdom ) and host country , would have to pass through one of two semi-finals . The EBU split up countries with a friendly voting history into separate semi-finals , to give a better chance for other countries to win . Greece and Cyprus had often been accused of favoring each other , with each awarding the other the maximum number of points ( twelve ) at the previous contest . On January 28 , 2008 , the EBU held a special draw which determined that Greece would be in '' Semi-final 1 '' held on May 20 , 2008 in Belgrade , Serbia ; Cyprus was subsequently placed in the second semi-final

In previous years , countries that received a top 10 placing were automatically granted a spot in the next year 's final without having to compete in a semi-final , but for 2008 , the EBU changed the automatic qualification regulations so that all countries except the " Big 4 " ( France , Germany , Spain , and the United Kingdom ) and host country , would have to pass through one of two semi-finals . The EBU split up countries with a friendly voting history into separate semi-finals , to give a better chance for other countries to win . Greece and Cyprus had often been accused of favoring each other , with each awarding the other the maximum number of points ( twelve ) at the previous contest . On January 28 , 2008 , the EBU held a special draw which determined that Greece would be in '' Semi-final 1 '' held on May 20 , 2008 in Belgrade , Serbia ; Cyprus was subsequently placed in the second semi-final

		CONTEXT=Although Greece had been granted a spot in the 2008 final because of its seventh-place finish at the Eurovision Song Contest 2007 , it had to compete in a semi-final for the first time since 2004 because of new rules put into effect by the European Broadcasting Union ( EBU ) . In previous years , countries that received a top 10 placing were automatically granted a spot in the next year 's final without having to compete in a semi-final , but for 2008 , the EBU changed the automatic qualification regulations so that all countries except the " Big 4 " ( France , Germany , Spain , and the United Kingdom ) and host country , would have to pass through one of two semi-finals . The EBU split up countries with a friendly voting history into separate semi-finals , to give a better chance for other countries to win . Greece and Cyprus had often been accused of favoring each other , with each awarding the other the maximum number of points ( twelve ) at the previous contest . On January 28 , 2008 , the EBU held a special draw which determined that Greece would be in '' Semi-final 1 '' held on May 20 , 2008 in Belgrade , Serbia ; Cyprus was subsequently placed in the second semi-final

QUERY_CONTEXT=Duane Allman created the idea of having two lead guitarists , which was inspired by Curtis Mayfield ; " he wanted the bass , keyboards , and second guitar to form patterns behind the solo rather than just comping , " said Allman . Their style and incorporation of guitar harmonies was very influential on later musicians . " The pair also had a wide range of complementary techniques , often forming intricate , interlocking patterns with each other and with the bassist , Berry Oakley , setting the stage for dramatic flights of improvised melodies . " Dickey Betts ' playing was very melody-based ; " My style is just a little too smooth and round to play the blues stuff straight , because I 'm such a melody guy that even when I 'm playing the blues , I go for melody first , " he said . His listening of country and string bluegrass growing up influenced this considerably : " I played mandolin , ukulele , and fiddle before I ever touched a guitar , which may be where a lot of the major keys I play come from . " He later characterized their style as " question and answer , anticipation and conclusion , " which involved allowing each musician 's downbeat to arrive in a different spot , while also keeping consideration of the bass guitar lines . The group also held an improvisational approach to live performances , which connected the band with jam band culture . " Jazz and blues musicians have been doing this for decades , but I think they really brought that sense that anyone onstage can inspire anyone else at any given time to rock music , " said Haynes . " We sure did n't set out to be a " jam band " but those long jams just emanated from within the band , because we did n't want to just play three minutes and be over , " said Allman . '' Rolling Stone '' referred to the group as " without question the first great jam band , and they took the jam to heights that it had not previously reached . " The Allman Brothers Band were considerably influential within the Southern United States . Their arrival on the musical scene paved the way for several other notable Southern rock bands — among those Lynyrd Skynyrd , the Marshall Tucker Band and Wet Willie — to achieve commercial success , and also " almost single-handedly " made Capricorn Records into " a major independent label . " Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top , writing for '' Rolling Stone '' , wrote that the group " defined the best of every music from the American South in that time . They were the best of all of us . " He went on to call the band " a true brotherhood of players — one that went beyond race and ego . It was a thing of beauty . " The band 's extended popularity through heavy touring in the early 1990s created a new generation of fans , one that viewed the Allmans as pioneers of " latter-day collegiate jam rock . " AllMusic praised the band 's history : " they went from being America 's single most influential band to a shell of their former self trading on past glories , to reach the 21st century resurrected as one of the most respected rock acts of their era . " In 2012 , an official historic marker was erected on the site of the July 1970 Second Atlanta International Pop Festival near Byron , Georgia . The Allman Brothers Band had played two sets at the festival , which was a significant event in their career . The marker text reads , in part : " Over thirty musical acts performed , including ... Macon 's Allman Brothers Band on their launching pad to national fame . " Official sponsors of the marker included the Georgia Allman Brothers Band Association , The Allman Brothers Band Museum at the Big House , and '' Hittin ' the Note '' . In 2003 , the band released a recording of their festival opening and closing performances , '' Live at the Atlanta International Pop Festival : July 3 & 5 , 1970 ''

		CONTEXT=According to a 2012 '' Economist '' article , a group of ten anonymous Tzotzil people claiming to be survivors of the Acteal massacre have taken an opportunity to sue former President Zedillo in a civil court in Connecticut , " seeking about $ 50 million and a declaration of guilt against Mr Zedillo . " The victims of the massacre were members of an indigenous-rights group known as Las Abejas ; however , the current president of that organization , Porfirio Arias , claims that the alleged victims were in fact not residents of Acteal at all . This has led commentators to allege the trial to be politically motivated , perhaps by a member of his own political party , the Institutional Revolutionary Party , angry about Zedillo 's reforms that led to the party losing power in the 2000 Mexican presidential election , after 71 years of continuous political rule

QUERY_ANSWERS={'Caltavuturo massacre'}
QUERY_CONTEXT=According to many scholars , the name and origin of the town are traced back to the period of Arab rule . According to Ibn al-Athir ( '' The Complete History '' , VII .370.5 – 7 ) , in AH 268 ( 881/82 CE ) , the Aghlabid commander Abū Ṯawr was defeated by the Byzantines ( probably commanded by the '' strategos '' Mosilikes ) and his was army annihilated , with only seven men surviving . The locality was later named in Arabic '' Qalʿat Abī Ṯawr '' ( " Castle of Abū Ṯawr " ) , which is the origin of the modern name . Others instead maintain that the name derives from the Arabic word " qal ' at " ( fortress ) and the Sicilian " vuturu " ( vulture ) meaning of " fortress of vultures . " The town existed under Byzantine rule pre Arab conquest as Aziz Ahmad in “ A Islamic History of Sicily ” ( edinburgh university press 1975 ) states that in 852 Abbas raided Caltavuturo in the northern part of the Island and took many prisoners who were sold as slaves , The town was the site of the so-called Caltavuturo massacre on 20 January 1893 , when local authorities killed 13 and wounded 21 peasants that had occupied communal land that they claimed was theirs

		CONTEXT=About Minoan warfare , Branigan concluded : Archaeologist Olga Krzyszkowska agreed : " The stark fact is that for the prehistoric Aegean we have no direct evidence for war and warfare '' per se '' . " Between 1935 and 1939 , Greek archaeologist Spyridon Marinatos posited the Minoan eruption theory . An eruption on the island of Thera ( present-day Santorini ) , about from Crete , occurred during the LM IA period ( 1550 – 1500 BC ) . One of the largest volcanic explosions in recorded history , it ejected about of material and was measured at 7 on the Volcanic Explosivity Index . The eruption devastated the nearby Minoan settlement at Akrotiri on Santorini , which was entombed in a layer of pumice . Although it is believed to have severely affected the Minoan culture of Crete , the extent of its effects has been debated . Early theories proposed that volcanic ash from Thera choked off plant life on the eastern half of Crete , starving the local population ; however , more-thorough field examinations have determined that no more than of ash fell anywhere on Crete . Based on archaeological evidence , studies indicate that a massive tsunami generated by the Thera eruption devastated the coast of Crete and destroyed many Minoan settlements . Although the LM IIIA ( late Minoan ) period is characterized by affluence ( wealthy tombs , burials and art ) and ubiquitous Knossian ceramic styles , by LM IIIB Knossos ' wealth and importance as a regional center apparently declined

		CONTEXT=According to many scholars , the name and origin of the town are traced back to the period of Arab rule . According to Ibn al-Athir ( '' The Complete History '' , VII .370.5 – 7 ) , in AH 268 ( 881/82 CE ) , the Aghlabid commander Abū Ṯawr was defeated by the Byzantines ( probably commanded by the '' strategos '' Mosilikes ) and his was army annihilated , with only seven men surviving . The locality was later named in Arabic '' Qalʿat Abī Ṯawr '' ( " Castle of Abū Ṯawr " ) , which is the origin of the modern name . Others instead maintain that the name derives from the Arabic word " qal ' at " ( fortress ) and the Sicilian " vuturu " ( vulture ) meaning of " fortress of vultures . " The town existed under Byzantine rule pre Arab conquest as Aziz Ahmad in “ A Islamic History of Sicily ” ( edinburgh university press 1975 ) states that in 852 Abbas raided Caltavuturo in the northern part of the Island and took many prisoners who were sold as slaves , The town was the site of the so-called Caltavuturo massacre on 20 January 1893 , when local authorities killed 13 and wounded 21 peasants that had occupied communal land that they claimed was theirs

		CONTEXT=In the beginning of 1920 , Sultanov intensified his efforts to bring control of the region under Azerbaijani rule by issuing an ultimatum to the Armenian National Council . In early 1920 , the Paris Peace Conference had recognized Azerbaijan 's '' de facto '' claim to Karabakh . But since the conference had ended without issuing a conclusive decision on Karabakh , Sultanov advocated for a local solution , one which demanded that the region be incorporated into Azerbaijan . He bolstered the size of the garrisons at Khankendi and continued to move his troops around , once more without the required consent of his administrative council . Ethnic tension in Karabakh heightened once more , as Azerbaijani troops lynched and killed several Armenians in Khankendi and pillaged the surrounding areas in February of that year . In early March , after a delegation of Karabakh Armenians met in the village of Shosh and rejected the possibility of union with Azerbaijan , Sultanov sought to tighten his control of Karabakh : he forbade Armenians from leaving Shusha without permission , stationed Azerbaijani troops in Armenian homes , ordered Armenian veterans of the former Russian Army to register so that they may not partake in military activities , and drew up plans to destroy several Armenian villages to sever the link between Armenians in Karabakh and the region of Zangezur . In March 1920 , mass killings of the Armenian population took place in the Shusha massacre

Its streak was ended in 2010 when '' Top Chef '' won the Emmy for this category . Host Phil Keoghan revealed in an interview that the show 's loss that year made him and the producers realize that they will have to try harder to win the Emmy again . In 2011 , the show won in the category again for the eighth time . After its seventh consecutive win , some in the media , including '' Survivor '' host Jeff Probst suggested that '' The Amazing Race '' willingly drop out from the competition in future years , similar to Candice Bergen declining any further nominations after her fifth Emmy win for her role in '' Murphy Brown '' . Van Munster has stated that it is " not likely " he will pull the show from future Emmy awards , considering that it reflects on his and his crew 's hard work and high standards . The show has also been nominated and won several times for technical production ( Creative Arts ) Emmy awards , for Cinematography and Picture Editing for Non-Fiction programs , whereas it has only been nominated for Sound Mixing and Sound Editing for Non-Fiction programs . The show has been nominated in the same five categories for three years consecutively , a trend which continued with the 2007 Primetime Emmy Awards

QUERY_CONTEXT='' The Amazing Race '' won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Reality-Competition Program for the first seven years after the creation of the award in 2003 , and ten of the twelve years since its creation , against other , more popular reality TV shows such as '' Survivor '' , '' Dancing with the Stars '' , and '' American Idol '' . Its streak was ended in 2010 when '' Top Chef '' won the Emmy for this category . Host Phil Keoghan revealed in an interview that the show 's loss that year made him and the producers realize that they will have to try harder to win the Emmy again . In 2011 , the show won in the category again for the eighth time . After its seventh consecutive win , some in the media , including '' Survivor '' host Jeff Probst suggested that '' The Amazing Race '' willingly drop out from the competition in future years , similar to Candice Bergen declining any further nominations after her fifth Emmy win for her role in '' Murphy Brown '' . Van Munster has stated that it is " not likely " he will pull the show from future Emmy awards , considering that it reflects on his and his crew 's hard work and high standards . The show has also been nominated and won several times for technical production ( Creative Arts ) Emmy awards , for Cinematography and Picture Editing for Non-Fiction programs , whereas it has only been nominated for Sound Mixing and Sound Editing for Non-Fiction programs . The show has been nominated in the same five categories for three years consecutively , a trend which continued with the 2007 Primetime Emmy Awards

QUERY_CONTEXT=Gibson became involved in politics as a member of the Whig Party with strong anti-slavery views . During the U.S. Presidential campaign of 1844 , he gave stump speeches for Henry Clay due to the Whig Party 's platform that opposed admitting Texas into the Union because it was a slave state . In the U.S. Presidential campaign of 1848 , Gibson supported Whig candidate , " Rough and Ready " General Zachary Taylor . However , he was concerned about the Whig Party 's lack of opposition to the abolition of slavery and personally visited Henry Clay at his home in Ashland , Kentucky in 1848 to discuss this issue . He lost as a Whig candidate for Ohio Attorney General in 1853 . In 1853 , following the large defeat of the Whig candidate General Winfield Scott in the U.S. Presidential election of 1852 , Gibson threw his support to the Free Soil Party and began organizing what would become the Republican Party in Ohio .

QUERY_CONTEXT=The first official Republican convention in Illinois was held on May 29 , 1856 , in Bloomington . Chairman John M. Palmer was elected convention president after his opening address . Nine vice presidents and five secretaries were then elected . The convention nominated Bissell for governor with Francis Hoffmann as lieutenant governor , Ozias M. Hatch for secretary of state , Jesse K. Dubois as auditor , and James Miller as treasurer . Hoffmann was found to be ineligible for his position due to a residency requirement , and John Wood was nominated in his place . The following resolutions defining the party platform were approved : Resolved , That foregoing all former differences of opinions upon other questions , we pledge ourselves to unite in opposition to the present administration and to the party which upholds and supports it and to use all honorable and constitutional means to wrest the Government from the unworthy hands which now control it and to bring it back in its administration to the principles and practices of Washington , Jefferson and their great and good compatriots of the Revolution . Resolved , That foregoing all former differences of opinions upon other questions , we pledge ourselves to unite in opposition to the present administration of the Government ; that under the Constitution Congress possesses the power to prohibit slavery in the Territories ; and that , whilst we will maintain all constitutional rights of the South , we also hold that justice , humanity , the principles of freedom as expressed in our Declaration of Independence and our national constitution , and the purity and perpetuity of our Government require that that power shall be exerted to prevent the extension of slavery into territory heretofore free . Resolved , That the repeal of the Missouri Compromise was unwise and injurious ; an open and aggravated violation of the plighted faith of the States , and that the attempt of the present administration to force slavery into Kansas against the known wishes of the legal voters of that Territory is an arbitrary and tyrannous violation of the rights of the people to govern themselves , and that we will strive by all constitutional means to secure to Kansas and Nebraska the legal guaranty against slavery of which they were deprived at the cost of the violation of the plighted faith of the nation . Resolved , That we are devoted to the Union and will , to the last extremity , defend it against the efforts now being made by the dis-unionists of this administration to compass its dissolution , and that we will support the Constitution of the United States , in all its provisions regarding it , as the sacred bond of our Union and the only safeguard for the preservation of the rights of ourselves and our posterity . Resolved , That we are in favor of the immediate admission of Kansas as a member of this Confederacy under the constitution adopted by the people of said Territory . Resolved , That the spirit of our institutions as well as the Constitution of our country , guarantees the liberty of conscience as well as political freedom , and that we will proscribe no one by legislation or otherwise on account of religious opinions , or in consequence of place of birth . Lincoln delivered the closing address . The speech was purportedly so captivating that no reporter made a record of it . The address has become known as Lincoln 's Lost Speech .

QUERY_CONTEXT=" Motivation " is a R&B slow jam song written by Richard Butler ( Rico Love ) , Jim Jonsin , Dwayne Carter and Danny Morris . The racy lyrics center around Rowland asking her man to use his hands all over her body , and are accompanied by a " synth-saturated beat " produced by Jonsin . In terms of instruments , " Motivation " uses sparse keyboard notes , programmed beats and pulsing synths in the chorus . Wayne adds a rap verse complementing Rowland 's seductive suggestions , using the kitchen and a car as metaphors for sex . According to Scott Shetler from AOL Music , Rowland uses the lyrics to promise " to be her lover 's motivation . " Rowland called the record a mixture between dance and mash-up . When asked by MTV what Rowland thought of the song , she said , " It has that personality and characteristic to it that I do n't think anybody can deny . That 's why when Wayne dropped that insane verse on there ... I was like , ' You really brought that up even more . ' He went into the studio and just did it . I do n't think it takes much for Wayne to think . He just does it . He 's so admirable . " Ryan Brockington , from the '' New York Post , '' was amongst the first to review " Motivation . " In his review , he said " The single is a big leap from the dance club synth pop that Kelly has been releasing the past year and it seems like she might be trying to shimmy her way back into the hip-hop world by teaming up with the Midas touch vocals of Lil Wayne . " Both '' Rap-Up '' and AOL Music 's Scott Shetler called the song " sexy . " Becky Bain from Idolator disliked the song for not being memorable . The short review was summed up with the closing phrase , " she ’s going to need another hit to help promote her album when it finally is ready to drop . " Wesley Case from '' The Baltimore Sun '' complemented the song 's sexy quality . " If this is n't the year 's hands-down sexiest song thus far , it has to be in the discussion . Rowland , whose sultry voice could get a priest hot , weaving in and out of the minimal beat , and setting the table for Lil Wayne 's stuttering , after-hours guest-verse . Stack the pieces together and it 's an understated knockout that gets sexier with each spin . " Billboard ranked it number five on their " Critics ' Picks : 20 Best Songs of 2011 " " Motivation " was nominated for two awards at the 2011 Soul Train Music Awards including Best Dance Performance and Song of the Year.It won the award for Song of the Year and was also nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration at the 54th Grammy Awards , which was held on February 12 , 2012

During the last stages of the Demyansk battles it was in the 53rd Army . After rebuilding it moved to Bryansk Front in the new 63rd Army and took part in the summer offensive that liberated Smolensk . Late in the year it was briefly assigned to the Belorussian Front and then to the 1st Ukrainian Front ; while serving under this command it won a battle honor .

		CONTEXT=The 397th Rifle Division was partially raised in 1941 as an infantry division of the Red Army but this formation was disbanded after about five weeks . A new formation began on January 14 , 1942 in the Volga Military District and it remained in that role through the rest of the Great Patriotic War . It first went to the front in March , briefly assigned to the 3rd Shock Army before it was moved to the 1st Shock Army in Northwestern Front . It spent nearly a year in the dismal fighting around the Demyansk salient ; during January , 1943 two of its rifle regiments were encircled and nearly destroyed during an unsuccessful offensive before escaping . During the last stages of the Demyansk battles it was in the 53rd Army . After rebuilding it moved to Bryansk Front in the new 63rd Army and took part in the summer offensive that liberated Smolensk . Late in the year it was briefly assigned to the Belorussian Front and then to the 1st Ukrainian Front ; while serving under this command it won a battle honor . In late February , 1944 it became part of the 47th Army in 2nd Belorussian Front . Prior to the summer offensive it was moved again , now to the 61st Army , where it would remain for the duration . During the later stages of Operation Bagration it was decorated with the Order of the Red Banner and in the fall during the campaign in the Baltic states it would also receive the Order of Kutuzov . By the end of the year the 61st Army was assigned to 1st Belorussian Front and the 397th fought through Poland and eastern Germany during the winter and spring of 1945 , eventually taking part in the offensive on Berlin . Its soldiers had by then compiled a distinguished record of service , but despite this the division was disbanded in July .

		GOLD_MENTION=2009 Heilongjiang mine explosion
		SCORE=4.654771714740491e-07
		CONTEXT=Safety has long been a concern in the mining business , especially in sub-surface mining . The Courrières mine disaster , Europe 's worst mining accident , involved the death of 1,099 miners in Northern France on March 10 , 1906 . This disaster was surpassed only by the Benxihu Colliery accident in China on April 26 , 1942 , which killed 1,549 miners . While mining today is substantially safer than it was in previous decades , mining accidents still occur . Government figures indicate that 5,000 Chinese miners die in accidents each year , while other reports have suggested a figure as high as 20,000 . Mining accidents continue worldwide , including accidents causing dozens of fatalities at a time such as the 2007 Ulyanovskaya Mine disaster in Russia , the 2009 Heilongjiang mine explosion in China , and the 2010 Upper Big Branch Mine disaster in the United States . Mining has been identified by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ( NIOSH ) as a priority industry sector in the National Occupational Research Agenda ( NORA ) to identify and provide intervention strategies regarding occupational health and safety issues . The Mining Safety and Health Administration ( MSHA ) was established in 1978 to " work to prevent death , illness , and injury from mining and promote safe and healthful workplaces for US miners . " Since its implementation in 1978 , the number of miner fatalities has decreased from 242 miners in 1978 to 28 miners in 2015

		CONTEXT=The third summit was held in New York City in December . Arriving there , Gorbachev gave a speech to the United Nations Assembly where he announced a unilateral reduction in the Soviet armed forces by 500,000 ; he also announced that 50,000 troops would be withdrawn from Central and Eastern Europe . He then met with Reagan and President-elect George H. W. Bush ; he rushed home , skipping a planned visit to Cuba , to deal with the Armenian earthquake . On becoming U.S. President , Bush appeared interested in continuing talks with Gorbachev but wanted to appear tougher on the Soviets than Reagan had to allay criticism from the right-wing of his Republican Party . In December 1989 , Gorbachev and Bush met at the Malta Summit . Bush offered to assist the Soviet economy by suspending the Jackson-Vanik Amendment and repealing the Stevenson and Baird Amendments . There , the duo agreed to a joint press conference , the first time that a U.S. and Soviet leader had done so . Gorbachev also urged Bush to normalise relations with Cuba and meet its President , Fidel Castro , although Bush refused to do so

The film was scored by Dimitri Tiomkin , his first collaboration with Hitchcock ( the others being '' Strangers on a Train '' , '' I Confess '' and '' Dial M for Murder '' ) . In his score , Tiomkin quotes the '' Merry Widow Waltz '' of Franz Lehár , often in somewhat distorted forms , as a leitmotif for Uncle Charlie and his serial murders . During the opening credits , the waltz theme is heard along with a prolonged shot of couples dancing

QUERY_CONTEXT=And Japan was eager to take every opportunity . In 1869 they took advantage of the defeat of the rebels of the Republic of Ezo to incorporate definitely the island of Hokkaido to Japan . For centuries , Japan viewed the Ryukyu Islands as one of its provinces . In 1871 the Mudan incident happened : cannibal Taiwanese aborigines murdered 54 Ryūkyūan sailors that had their ship shipwrecked . At that time the Ryukyu Islands were claimed by both Qing China and Japan , and the Japanese interpreted the incident as an attack on their citizens . They took steps to bring the islands in their jurisdiction : in 1872 the Japanese Ryukyu Domain was declared , and in 1874 a retaliatory incursion to Taiwan was sent , which was a success . The success of this expedition emboldened the Japanese : not even the Americans could defeat the Taiwanese cannibals in the Formosa Expedition of 1867 . Very few gave it much thought at the time , but this was the first move in the Japanese expansionism series . Japan occupied Taiwan for the rest of 1874 and then left owing to Chinese pressures , but in 1879 it finally annexed the Ryukyu Islands . In 1875 Qing China sent a 300-men force to subdue the Taiwanese cannibals , but unlike the Japanese the Chinese were routed , ambushed and 250 of their men were killed ; the failure of this expedition exposed once more the failure of Qing China to exert effective control in Taiwan , and acted as another incentive for the Japanese to annex Taiwan . Eventually , the spoils for winning the First Sino-Japanese War in 1894 included Taiwan

During the 1870s , failed in engage in significant expansion . This was due in part to the domestic turmoil such as peasant and samurai uprisings faced by the nascent Meiji government and financial difficulties , as acquiring a large navy was an expensive proposition . Consequently , the IJN concentrated on developing its officer corps and the training of its personnel . However , in the early 1880s , in the aftermath of the Imo Incident in 1882 and with internal threats to its security eliminated , the Meiji government undertook the first significant naval expansion in Japan 's history . The IJN developed plans for the expansion of the fleet to forty - two vessels , thirty - two of which would have to be newly constructed . Between 1882 and 1884 , twelve new vessels were purchased or put under construction . Spurred on by anxieties over China , Japanese military expenditures grew steadily in the 1880s . In 1880 the share of military spending had amounted to 19 percent of total government expenditures , in 1886 it had risen to 25 percent and by 1890 it stood at 31 percent .

		CONTEXT=Linois 's expedition to the Indian Ocean was a commerce raiding operation launched by the French Navy during the Napoleonic Wars . Contre - Admiral Charles - Alexandre Durand Linois was ordered to the Indian Ocean in his flagship Marengo in March 1803 accompanied by a squadron of three frigates , shortly before the end of the Peace of Amiens . When war between Britain and France broke out in September 1803 , Marengo was at Pondicherry with the frigates , but escaped a British squadron sent to intercept it and reached Isle de France ( now Mauritius ) . The large distances between naval bases in the Indian Ocean and the limited resources available to the British commanders in the region made it difficult to concentrate sufficient forces to combat a squadron of this size , and Linois was subsequently able to sustain his campaign for three years . From Isle de France , Linois and his frigates began a series of attacks on British commerce across the Eastern Indian Ocean , specifically targeting the large convoys of East Indiamen that were vital to the maintenance of trade within the British Empire and to the British economy . Although he had a number of successes against individual merchant ships and the small British trading post of Bencoolen , the first military test of Linois squadron came at the Battle of Pulo Aura on 15 February 1804 . Linois attacked the undefended British China Fleet , consisting of 16 valuable East Indiamen and 14 other vessels , but failed to press his military superiority and withdrew without capturing a single ship .

		CONTEXT=He established himself in Chicago , where in the great fire of 1871 he lost everything he possessed . In 1875 , he moved to New York City , finding work on the '' Century '' ( then '' Scribners '' ) magazine . Cole was associated with the magazine for 40 years as a pioneer craftsman of wood engraving . He immediately attracted attention by his unusual facility and his sympathetic interpretation of illustrations and pictures , and his publishers sent him abroad in 1883 to engrave a set of blocks after the old masters in the European galleries . These achieved for him a brilliant success . His reproductions of Italian , Dutch , Spanish , Flemish and English pictures were published in book form with appreciative notes by the engraver himself . '' Old Dutch and Flemish Masters '' was one of the books that Cole had contributed his wood engravings . Though the advent of new mechanical processes had rendered wood engraving almost a lost art and left practically no demand for the work of such craftsmen , Mr Cole was thus enabled to continue his work , and became one of the foremost contemporary masters of wood engraving . He received a medal of the first class at the Paris Exhibition of 1900 , and the only grand prize given for wood engraving at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition at St Louis , Missouri , in 1904 . In 1906 he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate Academician , and became a full Academician in 1908 . His son , Alphaeus Philemon Cole , was a noted portraitist who is also today recognized as having been the worlds oldest verified living man at the time of his death

		CONTEXT=RAFOS floats are submersible devices used to map ocean currents well below the surface . They drift with these deep currents and listen for acoustic " pongs " emitted at designated times from multiple moored sound sources . By analyzing the time required for each pong to reach a float , researchers can pinpoint its position by triangulation . The floats are able to detect the pongs at ranges of hundreds of kilometers because they generally target a range of depths known as the SOFAR ( SOund Fixing And Ranging ) channel , which acts as a waveguide for sound . The name " RAFOS " derives from the earlier SOFAR floats , which emitted sounds that moored receivers picked up , allowing real - time underwater tracking . When the transmit and receive roles were reversed , so was the name : RAFOS is SOFAR spelled backward . Listening for sound requires far less energy than transmitting it , so RAFOS floats are cheaper and longer lasting than their predecessors , but they do not provide information in real - time : instead they store it on board , and upon completing their mission , drop a weight , rise to the surface , and transmit the data to shore by satellite .

It was featured in a seven - page hoax supplement , published in the style of contemporary reviews of foreign countries , commemorating the tenth anniversary of the island 's independence , complete with themed advertisements from major companies . The supplement provided an elaborate description of the nation as a tourist destination and developing economy , but most of its place names and characters were puns and plays on words relating to printing ( such as " sans - serif " and names of common fonts ) . The original idea was to place the island in the Atlantic Ocean near Tenerife , but because of the ground collision of two Boeing 747s there a few days before publication it was moved to the Indian Ocean , near the Seychelles Islands . Because of this late move the authors made San Serriffe a moving island - a combination of coastal erosion on its west side and deposition on the east cause it to move towards Sri Lanka , with which it will eventually collide , at about 1.4 km / year .

During this time , purges of 1933 and the party restructuring that followed in 1935 , bureaucrats , corrupt officials , shirkers and those who sought personal gain over state benefit were targeted , rather than previous purges which had focused upon bourgeoisie elements . Even if one were not a target of the purge , a broad range of society was effected , because the purges were aimed at eliminating all those affiliated with a targeted party member . Fear of arrest , denunciation , or extortion , created uncertainty for every strata of society .

		GOLD_MENTION=Sétif massacre
		SCORE=7.938183330225002e-06
		CONTEXT='' The Philadelphia Inquirer '' published a review by Carrie Rickey , who wrote , " Under the obvious influence of Francis Ford Coppola , Bouchareb frames his shadow-ridden guerrilla heroes as the Algerian counterparts of the Corleones " , referring to the American film '' The Godfather '' , and further that '' Outside the Law '' owes " an enormous debt to Jean-Pierre Melville 's '' Army of Shadows '' ( 1969 ) , about French resistance fighters one-minded in their goal to subvert Nazis " . Rickey wrote , " Bouchareb is sometimes a little too one-minded : His movie might have been richer emotionally had he written scenes showing the characters ' domestic lives and not strictly their professional spheres . " Stephen Holden of '' The New York Times '' called '' Outside the Law '' a " didactic , unashamedly manipulative film " , and also saw parallels to '' The Godfather '' and '' Army of Shadows '' : " Those are mighty shoes to fill , and as powerful and well-made as it is , '' Outside the Law '' is too schematic and single-minded to lodge itself in your mind as a fully realized cinematic epic . Its few female characters are sketchy at best . " Before the film premiered , already it was met by political controversy and nationalist-oriented criticism in France . Lionnel Luca , a member of the National Assembly for the UMP , appealed for a review by the Defence Historical Service as soon as he heard about the project . Guy Pervillé deplored the inevitable acceptance by moviegoers of the film as representing historical truth . The Defence Historical Service claimed that " the errors and anachronisms are so many and so gross that they can be identified by any historian ... The numerous improbabilities present in the scenario show that the writing of the latter was not preceded by a serious historical study . " The center of the controversy was the depiction of the 1945 Sétif massacre early in the film . The report elaborated , " The director wants to suggest that on May 8 , 1945 , Muslims in Sétif were blindly massacred by Europeans , whereas it 's the contrary that transpired . ... A ll historians agree that ... Europeans lashed out against Muslims in response to Muslims massacring Europeans . " This reaction is at odds with mainstream history , which concluded that , after restoring order in the town , French military and police then carried out a series of reprisals and summary executions of native civilians . Before even seeing the film , Luca also criticized the decision to give public funding to a film which he considered " anti-French " . Mustapha Orif , one of the film 's co-producers , responded to the accusations and defended the film 's portrayal of the massacre . " Rachid Bouchareb interviewed many people , witnesses and historians . From this point of view , I do not think at all that he has deviated from historical reality , " he said

		GOLD_MENTION=École Polytechnique massacre
		SCORE=2.574156866330668e-06
		CONTEXT=The 1970s ushered in a period of wide-ranging social and political changes , stemming largely from the concerns of the French speaking majority about the conservation of their culture and language , given the traditional predominance of the English Canadian minority in the business arena . The October Crisis and the 1976 election of the Parti Québécois , supporting sovereign status for Quebec , resulted in the departure of many businesses and people from the city . In 1976 Montreal was the host of the Olympics . During the 1980s and early 1990s , Montreal experienced a slower rate of economic growth than many other major Canadian cities . Montreal was the site of the 1989 École Polytechnique massacre , Canada 's worst mass shooting , where 25-year-old Marc Lépine shot and killed 14 people , all of them women , and wounding 14 other people before shooting himself at École Polytechnique

		CONTEXT=In the beginning of 1920 , Sultanov intensified his efforts to bring control of the region under Azerbaijani rule by issuing an ultimatum to the Armenian National Council . In early 1920 , the Paris Peace Conference had recognized Azerbaijan 's '' de facto '' claim to Karabakh . But since the conference had ended without issuing a conclusive decision on Karabakh , Sultanov advocated for a local solution , one which demanded that the region be incorporated into Azerbaijan . He bolstered the size of the garrisons at Khankendi and continued to move his troops around , once more without the required consent of his administrative council . Ethnic tension in Karabakh heightened once more , as Azerbaijani troops lynched and killed several Armenians in Khankendi and pillaged the surrounding areas in February of that year . In early March , after a delegation of Karabakh Armenians met in the village of Shosh and rejected the possibility of union with Azerbaijan , Sultanov sought to tighten his control of Karabakh : he forbade Armenians from leaving Shusha without permission , stationed Azerbaijani troops in Armenian homes , ordered Armenian veterans of the former Russian Army to register so that they may not partake in military activities , and drew up plans to destroy several Armenian villages to sever the link between Armenians in Karabakh and the region of Zangezur . In March 1920 , mass killings of the Armenian population took place in the Shusha massacre

		CONTEXT=When Jackson left the role in 1999 , a recast was opposed by viewers and costars . When Jackson 's departure had previously been rumored in 1996 , Anthony Geary ( Luke ) told '' TV Guide '' that he " went to ( the '' GH '' powers ) and said , ' If we lose him , then let 's kill Lucky . ' Jonathan is too much a part of us to replace him . " Geary repeated these sentiments when Jackson confirmed leaving in 1999 . When a recast was rumored in early 2000 , Jackson stated : " When all the actors who are going to be working with the character do n't want it , it 's kind of too bad that they still do it . But I do n't really get surprised with a lot of things that they do . " The role was recast with Jacob Young , and by the time he appeared on-screen in February 2000 , the character had been off-screen for almost a year , speculated to be an attempt to ease the transition between actors due to Jackson 's popularity . Young was able to become accepted by fans ; in 2001 , Candace Havens wrote in '' The Free Lance – Star '' : " His hard work has paid off and many fans ca n't even remember there was ever someone else in the role . " Young was named Sexiest Soap Star by '' People '' magazine in 2001 . In 2002 , Young won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actor . Greg Vaughan , who took over the role from 2003 to 2009 , was the only portrayer of Lucky not to be nominated for an Emmy award . However , Vaughan did have a fan following . He was chosen by ABC Daytime and SOAPnet to participate in their 2008 Hot Guys Calendar , featuring popular male costars from ABC soap operas . At the start of 2008 , '' Zap2it '' named Vaughan No. 6 on their Top 10 Most Improved list , stating : " The gorgeous Mr. Vaughan plays angry and sexy very well . Thank goodness we 're getting to see it . " During Vaughan 's tenure , Lucky entered into a relationship with Sam McCall ( Kelly Monaco ) that was popular with fans . '' Zap2it '' named them No. 6 on their list of Top Couples of 2007 , and tied them for No. 3 in 2008 along with entangled couple Elizabeth ( Herbst ) and Jason Morgan ( Steve Burton ) , stating : " Lucky and Sam were conceived out of a revenge plot , yet quickly surprised fans and execs alike with their instant chemistry . Is the Quad in for another partner-switching shake-up in 2009 ? " When Vaughan left in 2009 , he reflected on his reception : " I am grateful as to how the fans embraced me , whether they liked me or not . It was my job to win them over and I did that in due time . " Some felt Vaughan was not a good fit for the character . In April 2008 , Allison Waldman of '' The Huffington Post '' named Jackson as one of the top ten actors to make an impact on '' General Hospital '' , stating : " He 's still the real Lucky to many people , even though two other actors have subsequently played the part . " When Jackson was hired to reprise the role in 2009 , his return was highly anticipated , but accompanied by controversy as Vaughan was let go in order to bring Jackson back . Fans had a bittersweet reaction to the switch . The network promoted Jackson 's return with the phrase , " Elizabeth 's first love is back ! " , which angered some of Vaughan 's fans . However , ratings rose the week Jackson returned , and his performance was well received . Jackson was nominated for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series in 2010 , only having been with the show for three months of 2009 . Jackson 's return changed the dynamic of the Elizabeth and Nikolas affair storyline , which had a negative reception from fans who thought it did not align with the history between Herbst and Jackson . The scenes in early 2010 where Lucky confronts Elizabeth and Nikolas about their affair received praise . That April , '' We Love Soaps '' named Jackson No. 26 of the top 50 Greatest Soap Actors , Damon L. Jacobs commenting : " From that first scene as Lucky in the Canadian diner , to his recent scenes of betrayal railing against Elizabeth and Nikolas , Jonathan adds a profound depth and spiritual gravity to the scripted words that is far beyond his years . His piercing bloodshot eyes shoot daggers far more deadly than Sonny 's guns , and his smile encapsulates all that was celebrated about Luke and Laura 's connection . " Michael Logan of '' TV Guide '' named Jackson the best actor of 2010 , referencing the affair confrontation when stating : Jackson submitted those scenes for the 38th Daytime Emmy Awards , where he won his fourth Daytime Emmy Award and first win as Outstanding Supporting Actor . The scenes were compared to classics such as Judith Light 's performance of Karen Wolek 's courtroom confession scene on '' One Life to Live '' and Kim Zimmer ’s performance of Reva Shayne 's fountain scene on '' Guiding Light '' . Jackson 's on-screen chemistry with Erin Chambers ( Siobhan ) also had a positive reception at the end of 2010 . However the following year they were rated the No. 6 Worst Soap Opera Couple of 2011 by '' Zap2it '' , who stated : " We spent 2011 desperately clinging to those few early memories , as Siobhan transformed from an appealing character into a shrill , insecure harpy ( ... ) Try as Jackson and Chambers might , the actors were unable to salvage an ounce of their prior appeal as a couple . " On the other hand , the entertainment website named Jackson No. 3 of the Top 10 Male Entertainers that year . Jackson had a range of emotional work in 2011 that received acclaim , including the scenes following the death of Lucky 's son Jake , a storyline met by criticism by some fans . In 2012 , Jackson won his fifth Daytime Emmy Award for his scenes where Lucky tells Luke that Luke was the driver that hit Jake and confronts him about his drinking . When Jackson was nominated , '' On-Air On-Soaps '' stated :

QUERY_CONTEXT=Writing for '' The New York Times '' , John J.

He praised the performances of the cast and that of Duttine in particular . '' People '' magazine called the series a " colorful chronicle of post-World War I England that never crosses over to the gooey side of sentiment .

		CONTEXT=As they were traveling with the theater , Simonovich-Efimova 's interest in painting rekindled . She was inspired to depict women in their regional dress digging potatoes , comforting their children , or attending fairs and festivals . She painted pictures of women and girls in 1924 and again in 1926 while in Lipetsk ; colorful images with reds , greens and ambers in a noted series called " Tambov women " ; picturesque scenes from Bashkiria and Udmurtia ; and a critically acclaimed series created in Crimea and Novgorod . The Novgorod paintings began in a period when the Effimovs had fled Moscow in 1935 because of political turmoil . During this time , purges of 1933 and the party restructuring that followed in 1935 , bureaucrats , corrupt officials , shirkers and those who sought personal gain over state benefit were targeted , rather than previous purges which had focused upon bourgeoisie elements . Even if one were not a target of the purge , a broad range of society was effected , because the purges were aimed at eliminating all those affiliated with a targeted party member . Fear of arrest , denunciation , or extortion , created uncertainty for every strata of society . The paintings from the period comprise mostly landscapes of the area surrounding the city and ancient buildings , where Simonovich-Efimova walked to enjoy the peace of her surroundings
