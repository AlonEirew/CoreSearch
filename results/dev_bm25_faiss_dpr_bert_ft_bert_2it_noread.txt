		GOLD_MENTION=October 2013 bushfires
		CONTEXT=The Railway was severely damaged by the ' State Mine Fire ' , part of the October 2013 bushfires . The Railway suffered millions of dollars of damage which included ten passenger carriages , four accommodation carriages , a nearly completed shower block and meal room destroyed and a spare parts centre and the machine shop and workshop badly damaged . Electrical equipment to operate signals was totally destroyed as was the repeater tower for the safety radio communication system and the internal telephone lines and exchange . One thousand new railway sleepers were also lost as was the caretaker 's converted accommodation carriage . The caretaker was " lucky to escape with her life " according to the Zig Zag 's then CEO Michael Forbes . Much of the damage was suffered by original railway equipment from the 1920s . At that time it was estimated that the railway would take a full year to recover from the State Mine Fire . Heavy rain then caused subsequent damage to an embankment near the western end of the Clarence tunnel , the platform area at Top Points , and to the run around loop track at Bottom Points . As at September 2017 restoration of vehicles and infrastructure is still being undertaken and hopes are for recommencement of services as soon as safe and practical . Due to the complexity of repairs and reinstatement infrastructure , the re-opening is currently hoped for late 2019 if all proceeds smoothly . The railway ’s website has updates on the redevelopment

		CONTEXT=Between 1974 and 1989 , the West Midlands Police force operated the West Midlands Serious Crime Squad . It was disbanded after allegations of endemic misconduct , leading to a series of unsafe convictions . These included allegations that officers had falsified confessions in witness statements , denied suspects access to solicitors and used torture such as " plastic bagging " to partially suffocate suspects in order to extract confessions . They were alleged to have abused payments to informers . A series of around 40 prosecutions failed in the late 1980s as defendants showed that evidence had or may have been tampered with . West Yorkshire Police led an investigation which led to a small number of internal disciplinary proceedings , but did not recommend any prosecutions for lack of evidence . However , over 60 convictions secured from their investigations have now been quashed , including those of the Birmingham Six and Bridgewater Four . The failed prosecutions and overturned convictions are listed here in two separate tables .

		CONTEXT=Greg Hunt was appointed Minister for the Environment . Hunt , a former Fulbright scholar , and human rights and development activist with the United Nations , had held the Shadow portfolio under successive Liberal leaders . The portfolio of Climate Change was abolished . The Abbottled Opposition campaigned on a promise of replacing the Rudd-Gillard Government 's carbon pricing system with a " direct action against climate change " policy . In July 2014 , the Abbott Government followed through with this commitment , becoming the first developed nation to repeal a carbon price and foregoing government revenue of $ 24 billion from polluters through to 2020 . Prior to becoming Opposition Leader , Abbott initially supported proposals by Liberal leaders Howard and Turnbull to introduce floating prices to reduce carbon emissions , but also expressed some doubts as to the science and economics underlying such initiatives . On the eve of the 2013 election , Abbott stated during an interview on the ABC TV '' Insiders '' that : On 19 September , Hunt abolished the advisory Climate Commission , stating that this move formed " part of the Coalition 's plans to streamline government processes and avoid duplication of services " and that the Department of the Environment would take on its role . Hunt has also stated that the government will abolish the Climate Change Authority and Clean Energy Finance Corporation . In October Abbott and Hunt disputed statements from Christiana Figueres , the head of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change , that the 2013 New South Wales bushfires were probably linked to climate change and that the government 's Direct Action policy would be harmful , with Abbott stating that Figueres was " talking through her hat "

		CONTEXT=Libya was strongly affected by the Arab Spring . Anti-government protests broke out in Benghazi , Libya , in February 2011 , and the Gaddafi government responded with military force . The Obama administration initially resisted calls to take strong action but relented after the Arab League requested Western intervention in Libya . In March 2011 , international reaction to Gaddafi 's military crackdown culminated in a United Nations resolution to enforce a no fly zone in Libya . Obama authorized U.S. forces to participate in international air attacks on Libyan air defenses using Tomahawk cruise missiles to establish the protective zone . The intervention was led by NATO , but Sweden and three Arab nations also participated in the mission . With coalition support , the rebels took Tripoli the following August . The Libyan campaign culminated in the toppling of the Gaddafi regime , but Libya experienced turmoil in the aftermath of the civil war . Obama 's intervention in Libya provoked criticism from members of Congress and ignited a debate over the applicability of the War Powers Resolution . In September 2012 , Islamic militants attacked the American consulate in Benghazi , killing Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans . Republicans strongly criticized the Obama administration 's handling of the Benghazi attack , and established a select committee in the House to investigate the attack . After his presidency , Obama acknowledged his " worst mistake " of his presidency was being unable to anticipate the aftermath of ousting Gaddafi

		GOLD_MENTION=Lockerbie bomber
		CONTEXT=In September 2009 , the convicted Lockerbie bomber , Abdelbaset al-Megrahi was released from a Scottish prison on compassionate grounds . The Daily Telegraph revealed that Sikora was one of three different doctors hired by the Libyan government to report to them about Megrahi 's condition . Sikora 's report concluded that Megrahi had only 3 months to live due to terminal prostate cancer . In fact , Megrahi died on 20 May 2012 , two years and 9 months after his release . Sikora has since admitted that the " 3 months " timescale was suggested to him by the Libyans . According to the Daily Telegraph , this was not the first time that Sikora had been economical with the truth . Sikora 's medical diagnosis was not used by the Scottish Justice Minister since it had been paid for by Libya , but his diagnosis did agree with the medical evidence that '' was '' used . Once released , Megrahi returned to Libya and far outlived the 3-month prognosis . In July 2010 , in an interview with the Sunday Times , Sikora said that " it was 'em barrassing ' that Megrahi has lived much longer than expected . " and " There was always a chance he could live for ten years , 20 years . . . But it 's very unusual . " This quote was then used first by the UK press and then by a group of USA Senators to undermine the Scottish decision to release Megrahi on compassionate grounds , and then to link the release instead with BP contracts in Libya . In reply , the Scottish Government stated categorically that Sikora 's medical opinion was not used by the Scottish Justice Minister . Sikora has since complained about the way journalists have reported his views and stated that there was probably a less than 1 % chance of Megrahi living 10 years

		CONTEXT=The show received a mixed reception from media publications . On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes , the show holds an approval rating of 43 % based on 30 critics , and summarized , " The 90th Academy Awards played it safe and hit no major snags -- but by clocking in at over four hours , returning host Jimmy Kimmel and company wore out their welcome long before the surprise ending . " Hank Stuever of '' The Washington Post '' marked , " In his second year , Kimmel has shown that the telecast need n't be anything but sharp and sure , with a funny host whose bits are manageable , shareable and – best of all – forgotten . We 're not making showbiz history here ; we 're just trying to get through another Oscar night . " Chief critic David Edelstein of '' Vulture '' wrote , " This was the best , most inspiring , and most sheerly likable Academy Awards telecast I 've ever seen . ... It was also – in terms of the actual awards – among the most disappointing . " '' Vanity Fair '' s , Richard Lawson wrote , " As a host , Kimmel struck a careful , appropriately measured tone ... All told , Sunday 's ceremony did an admirable job of recognizing all the turmoil surrounding it while maintaining the silly , chintzy trappings that so many of us tune into the Oscars for . " CNN 's Brian Lowry quipped , " The Oscars are a big , unwieldy beast , which invariably try to serve too many masters . Yet if the intent was ultimately to maintain a celebratory tone without ignoring either the outside world or the elephant in the room throughout this year 's awards , host Jimmy Kimmel and the show itself largely succeeded . " Others were more critical of the show . Television critic Maureen Ryan of '' Variety '' said , " All things considered , the show had a more or less low-key vibe . Normally it takes about two hours for the numbing effect to set in , but despite host Jimmy Kimmel 's best efforts , Sunday 's telecast started to feel a bit languid and low-energy far earlier . " Television critic James Poniewozik of '' The New York Times '' said , " despite the recent upheaval in Hollywood , the ceremony at large still focused mainly on celebration and glitter literally , in the case of the blinding set , which looked as if the ceremony were encased in an enormous geode . There 's also the perennial problem of bloat . The hitch , of course , is that every part of the show has its constituency . " Darren Franich of '' Entertainment Weekly '' wrote , " What fun we had at this year 's Oscars ! Long show , sure , but where to cut it ? " Writing for '' Deadline '' Greg Evans said , " Did the nearly four-hour running time contain any moments for the Oscar ages ? Probably not . " David Wiegand of the '' San Francisco Chronicle '' wrote , " Even the hope that the noise of clapping might keep the audience at home and in the theater awake , there was little of that for anything except the entrance of actors of advance age . " '' The Oregonian '' columnist Kristi Turnquist wrote , " Was it respectful ? Absolutely . Did it make for kind of a dull , earnest Oscars show ? Yeah , kind of . " Attaining 26.5 million U.S. viewers according to Nielsen ratings , the ceremony 's telecast had a 16-percent drop in viewership from last year 's ceremony and had the lowest U.S. viewership in Oscar history . On March 6 , after the final ratings were confirmed , President Donald Trump took to his Twitter account , saying , " Lowest rated Oscars in HISTORY . Problem is , we do n't have stars anymore – except your President ( just kidding , of course ) ! " . In response , Kimmel also tweeted , saying , " Thanks , lowest rated President in HISTORY . " In July 2018 , the ceremony presentation received eight nominations for the 70th Primetime Creative Arts Emmys

		CONTEXT=In April 2010 , six main characters were axed from '' EastEnders '' by executive producer Bryan Kirkwood . Fatboy was not one of them , but Stuart Heritage from '' The Guardian '' felt that he should have been , calling him " A wodge of irritating comic relief ... who is yet to serve a purpose other than making me genuinely dislike young people . ... He must go , preferably in a scene where he falls down the world 's largest flight of stairs . " Heritage later called Fatboy an " obnoxiously two-dimensional dubstep-fixated stock character transparently modelled on Jar Jar Binks . " A writer for the website Watch With Mothers called the character an asset to '' EastEnders '' , expressing pleasure that the show was trying to appeal to younger viewers , while another called him irritating and zany . A writer for '' The Northern Echo '' wondered if Fatboy , along with Leon and Zsa Zsa , brought a new injection of life into the soap or took away screen time from more established characters , and Caroline Fitton , writing for the '' Daily Mail '' , felt that Fatboy 's style of talking was a bit of a cliché . Grace Dent from '' The Guardian '' changed her opinion of Fatboy over time , saying : Julie Emery from '' Heat '' criticised Fatboy 's fashion sense , especially from the episode broadcast on 12 May 2011 , saying " We know clashing prints are soooooo this season , but really , Fatboy , they do nothing for you . And while we 're at it , stop wearing that tinny ' F ' round your neck , for flip 's sake . You 're not a gangster rapper , and anyway your real name 's Arthur . " Emery also said the storyline where Fatboy asks Mercy to marry him so she can stay in the country sounded " somewhat familiar " , as '' Coronation Street '' was featuring a similar storyline at the same time . Amy Duncan from the '' Metro '' said Fatboy was one of her favourite young characters in '' EastEnders '' and said that , with Poppy , he " bring s some much-needed light into the soap " . Vicky Prior from the '' Metro '' said that Fatboy " is easily one of the best characters in '' EastEnders '' , able to interact seamlessly with other characters , both young and old . " Norwood has received four award nominations for his portrayal of Fatboy . In May 2010 , he received a nomination in the " Best Soap Newcomer " category at the 14th TVChoice Awards , and in July he was nominated for " Best Newcomer " at the 2010 Inside Soap Awards , which he went on to win in September .

Rachit Gupta from '' Filmfare '' gave the film a rating of 4.5 / 5 , stating , " SS Rajamouli 's much-awaited sequel is the kind of movie Indian cinema should make regularly . It 's the kind of sweeping magnum opus that Indian mythos and culture deserve . It 's the biggest film we have ever made and barring a few minor glitches in CGI , this film is possibly the greatest spectacle you 'll see on a big screen , in your life . " Sangeetha Devi Dundoo from '' The Hindu '' stated , " For the most part , The Conclusion does n't let us take our eyes off the screen . It 's designed to be a cinematic celebration , one that deserves to be watched on the largest screen possible " . Anupama Subramanian of the '' Deccan Chronicle '' gave the film a 3.5 / 5 , praising the acting of the stars while complaining about " the lack of a solid plot ' and called the ending " predictable . " Vishnuprasad Pillai of '' Asianet News '' gave a negative review , writing that the film " offers nothing new ... The writing from KV Vijayendra Prasad fails inspire or to do justice to an epic of such scale , " adding that " the dialogues at times are downright corny and plot developments cringe-worthy . " Dipanjan Sinha of '' Hindustan Times '' gave the film a rating of 3/5 stars , praising the film 's cinematography and special effects , but found faults with some of the female characters . Sinha stated , " Devasena ... starts off as an ace warrior only to be tamed into someone who has to be protected . " Shubhra Gupta of '' Indian Express '' rated the film 2/5 stars , noting problems with pacing and sound , writing , " The background music is relentless , and the pitch at which the declamatory dialogues are delivered is deafening : there were times I felt like closing my ears . " Taran Adarsh of '' Bollywood Hungama '' rates the film 4.5 out of 5 and praises the performance of the cast , writing , " It 's a feast for moviegoers and has the trappings to make all generations its fan . " Meena Iyer from '' The Times of India '' rated it 4/5 , writing : " Just savor it . It is a visual extravaganza that India must feast on ... Prabhas is terrific as father and son . Of course , it is CGI and VFX that grab you in your seat . " Hemanth Kumar from '' Firstpost '' called it " Rajamouli 's epic drama " and rated it 4/5 . Sukanya Verma from '' Rediff '' rated the film 3.5 / 5 , writing the film , " continues its tradition of grandiloquence and magnitude ... high drama , more than spectacle , is what lends its riveting tale of revenge and glory all its wallop and wizardry . " She also praised the film 's cast and director stating , " Equipped with a cast that 's not only in tune with Rajamouli 's vision but knows exactly where to hold back and when to give their all adds to Baahubali 's might . " It was further featured in Rotten Tomatoes ' list of Best Off the Radar Films of 2017 , in which Tim Ryan writes , " '' Baahubali 2 : The Conclusion '' plays like a shotgun wedding between '' Ben Hur '' and '' Kung Fu Hustle '' , seasoned with bits of Shakespeare , Kurosawa , and Buster Keaton , " opining , " it 's a blockbuster that 's both gigantic and lighter than air . " Mike McCahill of The Guardian gave a 4/5 rating and called it " a jaw-dropping blockbuster that combines nimble action with genuine heart " . He also stated , " This production 's triumph is the room it 's granted Rajamouli to head into the fields and dream up endlessly expressive ways to frame bodies in motion . Of the many sequences here primed to cut through jadedness , perhaps the most wondrous is that which finds Baahu guiding Deva mid-battle to shoot three arrows simultaneously – a set piece that speaks both to a love of action , and love in action . The budget 's big , the muscle considerable , but they 're nothing compared with '' Baahubali '' s heart . " Manjusha Radhakrishnan of '' Gulf News '' rates the film 3.5 out of 5 and writes , " This is a sweeping visual spectacle filled with epic battle scenes , clashes between warring troops from Indian mythology and elephants on a rampage , " but further added , " There were times in the second half where you felt the computer-generated graphics took over the story . But all this is new and exotic for Indian cinema . " Shilpa Jamkhandikar of '' Reuters '' writes , " It may not up the ante from the last film , but it does n't let up on the pace either . For an Indian film , that is no mean feat . " J Hurtado of '' ScreenAnarchy '' writes , " It 's a bit daunting because it does begin in media res immediately following the complex actions of the first film , but astute viewers will put together the pieces soon enough . " Kabita Maharana of '' International Business Times '' gave a rating of 4 out of 5 and writes , " From the very first scene , the film is a visual extravaganza . Every frame is meticulously captured by SS Rajamouli and his team . This is the first Indian film hailed for excelling in visual effects . " Simon Abrams of RogerEbert.com gave the film a 4/4 rating and writes the film " is everything I want but rarely get from superhero and big-budget fantasy movie " adding " the fight scenes ... are so creative that they make even the most frequently abused creative shortcuts seem novel , everything from computer-generated imagery ( CGI ) to speed-ramping ... You care what happens to the cast as they , aided by wires , hurl volleys of arrows at disposable minions and CGI animals . " Anita Iyer from '' Khaleej Times '' rates the film 3.5 out of 5 and writes , " What stands out in the film is the powerful star cast . Enough has been said already about the acting prowess of Prabhas but he has an equally supportive cast to hold the film . Ramya Krishna as Sivagami , is known for her impressive acting talent and proves her mettle here . Another veteran , Sathyaraj as Katappa excels and you develop a camaraderie with him . Rana Daggubati is aptly spiteful in his portrayal of the villain ... Nassar , as his father , is busy spewing venom but his role could have been meatier . " '' The Conclusion '' won the Telstra People 's Choice Award at the Indian Film Festival of Melbourne , sharing the prize with '' Dangal '' . Tamannaah Bhatia and K.V.

This movie was a box office failure . Deol received mixed reactions from critics upon her performance . Savera R Someshwar of Rediff wrote " Esha , as a person , exudes a confidence that almost borders on arrogance . She 's athletic and seems perfectly capable of looking after herself in any situation . Esha , on screen , is required to convey three emotions : Love , sorrow and fear . Especially fear . No wonder she flounders . She is just unable to look terrorised . Even her alleged romance with costar Aftab has not helped her shed her stern demeanour in her romantic scenes . " Rakesh Budhu of Planet Bollywood wrote " She is n’t horrible , but given the hype , the demands and of course , comparisons , she surely is n’t up to the mark . Koi Mere Dil Se Poochhe is just plain old mediocre in such a way that you end up noticing the flaws in Esha ’s performance more . Her facial expressions need work , her attitude is beautiful but she seems too stern when it is not required . Of course , she is nowhere close to being a washout and if you are her fan you can appreciate the other aspects of her performances without completely losing faith in her future projects . " Despite mixed reactions and box office failure , Deol won numerous awards for her performance including the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut at the 48th Filmfare Awards

		CONTEXT=On January 27 , 2011 the festival sent 9 filmmakers to 9 cities across the US to screen and discuss their films . The cities and films included : Bob Tourtellotte of Reuters wrote " Sundance 2011 has proven to be exceptionally strong , audiences and filmmakers seem to agree . " Tourtellotte reported that Robert Redford said that three years ago the Sundance Institute " set out to get back to its roots of supporting alternative voices in cinema and he felt like this year that strategy paid off . " Redford said " This year , what has excited me , is I think the quality is increasing in diversity and is increasing in depth . " The AP reported that Redford said it 's " always a relief " when the festival ends because " it 's really exhausting . " Kenneth Turan , film critic for the '' Los Angeles Times '' , wrote " though the festival has gotten ever bigger — and ( thankfully ) more efficient in moving its close to 50,000 attendees in and out of its far-flung theaters — it still retains the scrappy , antic spirit that has animated it from the start . " Turan wrote " One of the paradoxes of Sundance is that the quirkiness and charm around the edges of the festival are not always fully appreciated because so much of the media focus is on the premieres section and the U.S. dramatic competition " which he said " are , frankly , often the weakest parts of the festival . " Turan said " Sundance 's insistence on giving equal weight to documentaries and dramas has made it into as important a nonfiction showcase as any festival in the world ; witness the fact that four out of the five Oscar-nominated docs this year debuted at Sundance last January . " He also wrote that the foreign language film competition " is a strength at Sundance , and yet that field is given even less popular attention than the documentaries . " Peter Knegt wrote that this year 's festival " probably wo n't replicate last year 's Oscar record . " He said " Despite a huge surge in sales , this year 's Sundance slate looks like it might be the least Oscar-friendly in some time . " He noted that the U.S. Dramatic Grand Jury Prize winners have been nominated for Best Picture for two years ( referring to '' Precious '' and '' Winter 's Bone '' ) . Knegt speculated on films that might be nominated for the Oscars . Films he deemed " most likely to succeed " at being nominated included : '' Like Crazy '' for Best Picture , Michael Shannon of '' Take Shelter '' for Best Actor , Elizabeth Olsen of '' Martha Marcy May Marlene '' for Best Actress , Felicity Jones of '' Like Crazy '' for Best Actress , Jessica Chastain of '' Take Shelter '' for Best Supporting Actress , '' Project Nim '' for Best Documentary Feature , '' Page One '' for Best Documentary Feature , and '' The Interrupters '' for Best Documentary Feature . He wrote " It 's reasonable to feel assured that at least one of Sundance 's docs will end up an Oscar nominee , if not two , three or four . " Jada Yuan of '' New York '' magazine wrote " perhaps the biggest highlight of the festival is just how ripe it 's been for acquisitions , with nearly 30 films getting picked up , the most at any Sundance ever . " On " why everyone is suddenly so bullish on independent film " , Owen Gleiberman wrote that the " energy and optimism at Sundance this year was n't just hype . " He said the factors he thought were driving a new evolving vision of the indie film world included : " The deals have n’t gotten cheaper — they 've gotten smarter " , a belief that last year 's new festival director John Cooper and director of programming Trevor Groth " have re-energized the festival , heightening its quality and organizing the movies with a tempting new shape and vision " , video on demand gives distributors a safety net and more confidence , and the audiences for Sundance movies are not going away , saying " The Oscars ... have become a testament to the central place that Sundance movies now occupy . " Redford was happy about the success of the festival , with about 45 films being sold vs 14 in 2010 , an increase of about 220 % . Redford said studios are realizing " there are audiences " for indie films

		CONTEXT=In a positive review for '' Cuepoint '' , Robert Christgau argued that while Azalea may never demonstrate a powerful , soulful , or attractively melodic delivery , her " striving Australian-Atlantan cadence " is original and carries every song . He deemed ' ' The New Classic '' " plenty authentic -- and damn good to boot " while dismissing Azalea 's media naysayers : " predictably , the songs where she expresses wonderment that ' Impossible Is Nothing ' are more relatable than the ones where she flaunts her liquid assets . But the ones where she pledges to keep on striving are more relatable than that , because striving is built into her flow itself . That 's what her complexity is about . " Phil Johnson from '' The Independent '' called it " an instantly engaging showcase of the 23-year-old Aussie 's talents – poppy without diluting her fierce-flowing charisma . " Kellan Miller of '' XXL '' said despite some poor songs near the end of the record , it is " a persuasive indicator that Iggy Azalea will be around for the long haul . " '' The New Classic '' was named one of the best hip-hop albums of the year by '' XXL '' on a list published on 30 June 2014 , adding that " the album proved to a gang of skepts who doubted Iggy 's controversial style from the start that she was more than capable of making hip-hop tracks with a pop appeal . " It was placed at number twenty-five on Digital Spy 's top albums of 2014 and listed among Fuse 's 40 best albums of 2014 . The album won the Breakthrough Artist Release award at the 2014 ARIA Music Awards and Favorite Rap/Hip-Hop Album at the 2014 American Music Awards , beating out Drake 's '' Nothing Was the Same '' and Eminem 's '' The Marshall Mathers LP 2 '' . It received a nomination for Best Rap Album at the 57th Grammy Awards . The album was also up for Top Rap Album at the 2015 Billboard Music Awards

On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes , the show holds an approval rating of 43 % based on 30 critics , and summarized , " The 90th Academy Awards played it safe and hit no major snags -- but by clocking in at over four hours , returning host Jimmy Kimmel and company wore out their welcome long before the surprise ending . " Hank Stuever of '' The Washington Post '' marked , " In his second year , Kimmel has shown that the telecast need n't be anything but sharp and sure , with a funny host whose bits are manageable , shareable and – best of all – forgotten . We 're not making showbiz history here ; we 're just trying to get through another Oscar night . " Chief critic David Edelstein of '' Vulture '' wrote , " This was the best , most inspiring , and most sheerly likable Academy Awards telecast I 've ever seen . ... It was also – in terms of the actual awards – among the most disappointing . " '' Vanity Fair '' s , Richard Lawson wrote , " As a host , Kimmel struck a careful , appropriately measured tone ... All told , Sunday 's ceremony did an admirable job of recognizing all the turmoil surrounding it while maintaining the silly , chintzy trappings that so many of us tune into the Oscars for . " CNN 's Brian Lowry quipped , " The Oscars are a big , unwieldy beast , which invariably try to serve too many masters . Yet if the intent was ultimately to maintain a celebratory tone without ignoring either the outside world or the elephant in the room throughout this year 's awards , host Jimmy Kimmel and the show itself largely succeeded . " Others were more critical of the show . Television critic Maureen Ryan of '' Variety '' said , " All things considered , the show had a more or less low-key vibe . Normally it takes about two hours for the numbing effect to set in , but despite host Jimmy Kimmel 's best efforts , Sunday 's telecast started to feel a bit languid and low-energy far earlier . " Television critic James Poniewozik of '' The New York Times '' said , " despite the recent upheaval in Hollywood , the ceremony at large still focused mainly on celebration and glitter literally , in the case of the blinding set , which looked as if the ceremony were encased in an enormous geode . There 's also the perennial problem of bloat . The hitch , of course , is that every part of the show has its constituency . " Darren Franich of '' Entertainment Weekly '' wrote , " What fun we had at this year 's Oscars ! Long show , sure , but where to cut it ? " Writing for '' Deadline '' Greg Evans said , " Did the nearly four-hour running time contain any moments for the Oscar ages ? Probably not . " David Wiegand of the '' San Francisco Chronicle '' wrote , " Even the hope that the noise of clapping might keep the audience at home and in the theater awake , there was little of that for anything except the entrance of actors of advance age . " '' The Oregonian '' columnist Kristi Turnquist wrote , " Was it respectful ? Absolutely . Did it make for kind of a dull , earnest Oscars show ? Yeah , kind of . " Attaining 26.5 million U.S. viewers according to Nielsen ratings , the ceremony 's telecast had a 16-percent drop in viewership from last year 's ceremony and had the lowest U.S. viewership in Oscar history . On March 6 , after the final ratings were confirmed , President Donald Trump took to his Twitter account , saying , " Lowest rated Oscars in HISTORY . Problem is , we do n't have stars anymore – except your President ( just kidding , of course ) ! " . In response , Kimmel also tweeted , saying , " Thanks , lowest rated President in HISTORY .

Savera R Someshwar of Rediff wrote " Esha , as a person , exudes a confidence that almost borders on arrogance . She 's athletic and seems perfectly capable of looking after herself in any situation . Esha , on screen , is required to convey three emotions : Love , sorrow and fear . Especially fear . No wonder she flounders . She is just unable to look terrorised . Even her alleged romance with costar Aftab has not helped her shed her stern demeanour in her romantic scenes . " Rakesh Budhu of Planet Bollywood wrote " She is n’t horrible , but given the hype , the demands and of course , comparisons , she surely is n’t up to the mark . Koi Mere Dil Se Poochhe is just plain old mediocre in such a way that you end up noticing the flaws in Esha ’s performance more .

		CONTEXT=In May 1943 the division transferred for garrison duties to the Greek island of Cefalonia . After Italy 's surrender to the Allies on 3 September 1943 the divisions commanding general Antonio Gandin was left without clear orders from his superiors . Therefore , Gandin decided to let his soldiers vote on 13 September 1943 as to what to do to next . The troops voted overwhelmingly to fight their former allies the Germans , thus the '' Acqui '' became one of the very few Italian units to actively resist the Germans . The Germans therefore summarily executed over half of the divisions soldiers and all of its officers in revenge during the Massacre of the Acqui Division

		CONTEXT=The Battle of Ortona ( 20 – 28 December 1943 ) was a battle fought between two battalions of elite German Fallschirmjäger ( paratroops ) from the German 1st Parachute Division under Generalleutnant Richard Heidrich , and assaulting Canadian troops from the Canadian 1st Infantry Division under Major General Chris Vokes , most of whom were fresh recruits whose baptism of fire was during the Invasion of Sicily . It was the culmination of the fighting on the Adriatic front in Italy during " Bloody December " . The battle was known to those who fought it as the " Italian Stalingrad , " for the brutality of its close - quarters combat , which was only worsened by the chaotic rubble of the town and the many booby traps used by both sides . The battle took place in the small Adriatic Sea town of Ortona , with a peacetime population of 10,000 .

		GOLD_MENTION=events in Moscow
		CONTEXT=By 1948 it was becoming apparent that the government control structure being unrolled in the Soviet occupation zone was based on careful planning . The key planners were a group of German Communist party members who had spent the Nazi period , including the war years , exiled in Moscow , and survived . On 30 April 1945 the 30 man Ulbricht Group had been flown in from Moscow to " prepare the ground " for the period of Soviet occupation . From the outset there was a certain mutual mistrust between the senior party comrades returning from Moscow , led by Walter Ulbricht and also including Wilhelm Pieck , and others who had survived the war years exiled in western Europe . Suspicion of the western survivors was especially intense where their wartime experiences had involved contact with Americans . Government nervousness increased during the later 1948s in the wider context of growing cold war tensions . In September 1948 the East German leader Walter Ulbricht announced the creation of an SED Party Control Commission , mandated to " lead the fight against hostile agents in the service of foreign powers " . This turned out to be the prelude to a period of purges in East Germany that recalled events in Moscow during the later 1930s . The targets in East Germany were ( again ) identified as " Trotskyists " and " anglo-american agents " . Marie Weiterer 's work for the Unitarian Universalist Service Committee in the south of France and later in Paris had always been undertaken with the full agreement of the leadership of the exiled German Communist party , but in the new spirit of the age it was nevertheless now characterised by the East German authorities as amounting to espionage activity undertaken in the service of Noel Field . On 1 September 1950 the party Central Committee published the text of a resolution dated 24 August 1950 ( identified as the " Field resolution " ) which excluded various senior party officers from party membership . Those accused were then sent into what amounted to " internal exile " . The most senior of these was Paul Merker . Maria Weiterer was another of those excluded from the party and stripped of all party related functions

		CONTEXT=The 15th Guards Rifle Division was reformed as an elite infantry division of the Red Army in February , 1942 , based on the 1st formation of the 136th Rifle Division , and served in that role until well after the end of the Great Patriotic War . The division had already distinguished itself during the Winter War with Finland in 1940 and had been decorated with the Order of Lenin ; soon after its redesignation it also received its first Order of the Red Banner . It was in Southern Front as this time but was soon moved to the Reserve of the Supreme High Command where it was assigned to 7th Reserve Army in May , then to 28th Army in Southwestern Front in June , then to 57th Army in Stalingrad Front in July . It remained in that Army for the rest of the year , with one brief exception , until it was transferred to Don Front 's 64th Army in January , 1943 during the closing stages of the battle of Stalingrad . In March this Army became 7th Guards Army and was railed to the northwest , joining Voronezh Front south of the Kursk salient . In the battle that followed the 15th Guards assisted in the defeat of Army Detachment Kempf , then took part in the summer offensive into Ukraine , winning one of the first battle honors at Kharkov . It remained in either 7th Guards or 37th Army into the spring of 1944 . It saw action in the Nikopol - Krivoi Rog Offensive and was awarded the Order of Suvorov before being involved in the frustrating battles along the Dniestr River on the Romanian border . In June the division became part of 34th Guards Rifle Corps in 5th Guards Army and was redeployed north becoming part of 1st Ukrainian Front and taking part in the Lvov – Sandomierz Offensive into Poland . The 15th Guards made a spectacular advance across Poland during the Vistula - Oder Offensive and was further decorated with the Order of Kutuzov for forcing a crossing of the Oder River . It then saw action in the drive on Berlin in April and the Prague Offensive in May , winning a further battle honor and an unusual second Order of the Red Banner in the process . After the war the division did garrison duty in Austria , then in Ukraine , followed by a move in late 1947 to Crimea and the Kuban where its personnel assisted in rebuilding the local economy and infrastructure for nearly 20 years . It September 1965 it was renumbered as the " 51st " and became the 2nd formation of the 51st Guards Motor Rifle Division .

		CONTEXT=There were numerous exiled German communists in Moscow , and they all used to report on one another to the Soviet authorities during the surge in political purges that accompanied growing political tensions domestically and internationally at this time . Such information demonstrated loyalty and was often blended with impressions or combined with denunciations . Hotropp himself provided a written report on Herwarth Walden , a fellow teacher at the Foreign Languages Institute who was later arrested . There was a perception that reports of this nature did not in themselves cause the authorities to arrest suspects , but they were certainly used by the NKVD where they provided evidential support for arrests that took place . Albert Hotopp 's own turn came on 31 May 1941 when he was arrested . On 1 August 1942 he was condemned to death . Available records are silent as to what happened next , but it is likely that he died shortly afterwards , probably in a Soviet labour camp . His wife Gertrud and their daughters were sent to continue their lives in Kazakhstan . His widow finally made her way back to East Germany in 1955 , after which she survived another thirty years .

After a long struggle for independence from Rome , they were defeated and substantial Roman colonies were placed on their soil . Only two inscriptions believed to be in the Aequian language remain . No more can be deduced than that the language was Italic . Otherwise , the inscriptions from the region are those of the Latin - speaking colonists in Latin . The colonial exonym documented in these inscriptions is Aequi and also Aequicoli ( " colonists of Aequium " ) . The manuscript variants of the classical authors present Equic - , Aequic - , Aequac - .

		CONTEXT=Throughout the early age of exploration , it became increasingly clear that the residents of the Iberian Peninsula were experts at navigation , sailing , and expansion . From Henry the Navigator 's first adventures down the African coast to Columbus 's fabled expedition resulting in the discovery of the new world , the figures that catalyzed the European appetite for expansion and imperialism heralded from either Spain or Portugal . However , merely a century earlier , nautical travel for most peoples was resigned to keeping within sight of a coastline and very rarely did ships venture out into deeper waters . The period 's ships were not able to handle the forces of open ocean travel and the crewmen had neither the ability nor the necessary materials to keep themselves from getting lost . A sailor 's ability to travel was dictated by the technology available , and it was n’t until the late 15th century that the development of the nautical sciences on the Iberian Peninsula allowed for the genesis of long distance shipping by directly effecting , and leading to the creation of , new tools and techniques relative to navigation . Christopher Columbus ’s famous expedition , which crossed the ocean in 1492 , was arguably the first contact the civilized world had with the newly discovered continent . Financed and sponsored by Queen Isabella of Spain , his journey would open the door to new trading lanes , imperialist appetites , and the meeting of cultures . Portugal and Spain became the world 's foremost leaders in deep water navigation and discovery because of their sailing expertise and the advancement of nautical sciences benefiting their ability to sail further , faster , more accurately , and safer than other states . Vast amounts of precious minerals and lucrative slaves were poured into Iberian treasuries between the late 15th and mid to late 17th centuries because of Spanish and Portuguese domination of Atlantic trade routes . The golden age of Spain was a direct result of the advancements made in navigation technology and the sciences which allowed for deep water sailing .

Already since the early summer of 1943 , German troops had been pouring into Greece , fearing an Allied landing there ( in fact falling victims to a grand-scale Allied strategic deception operation , " Operation Barclay " ) . Soon they became involved in wide-ranging counterguerrilla operations , which they carried out with great ruthlessness , based on their experiences in Yugoslavia .

		CONTEXT=There were numerous exiled German communists in Moscow , and they all used to report on one another to the Soviet authorities during the surge in political purges that accompanied growing political tensions domestically and internationally at this time . Such information demonstrated loyalty and was often blended with impressions or combined with denunciations . Hotropp himself provided a written report on Herwarth Walden , a fellow teacher at the Foreign Languages Institute who was later arrested . There was a perception that reports of this nature did not in themselves cause the authorities to arrest suspects , but they were certainly used by the NKVD where they provided evidential support for arrests that took place . Albert Hotopp 's own turn came on 31 May 1941 when he was arrested . On 1 August 1942 he was condemned to death . Available records are silent as to what happened next , but it is likely that he died shortly afterwards , probably in a Soviet labour camp . His wife Gertrud and their daughters were sent to continue their lives in Kazakhstan . His widow finally made her way back to East Germany in 1955 , after which she survived another thirty years . Albert Hotopp was formally rehabilitated by the Soviets in 1960

		GOLD_MENTION=1938 Yellow River flood
		CONTEXT=The name Zhengzhou came from the Sui dynasty ( AD 581 ) , even though it was located in Chenggao , another town . The government moved to the contemporary city during the Tang dynasty . It achieved its greatest importance under the Sui ( AD 581 – 618 ) , Tang ( 618 – 907 ) , and early Song ( 960 – 1127 ) dynasties , when it was the terminus of the New Bian Canal , which joined the Yellow River to the northwest . There , at a place called Heyin , a vast granary complex was established to supply the capitals at Luoyang and Chang ' an to the west and the frontier armies to the north . In the Song period , however , the transfer of the capital eastward to Kaifeng robbed Zhengzhou of much of its importance . It was a capital during the five dynasties of Xia , Shang , Guan , Zheng , and Han , and a prefecture during the eight dynasties of Sui , Tang , Five Dynasties , Song , Jin , Yuan , Ming , and Qing . In 1903 the Beijing – Hankou Railway arrived at Zhengzhou , and in 1909 the first stage of the Longhai Railway gave it an east – west link to Kaifeng and Luoyang ; it later was extended eastward to the coast at Lianyungang , Jiangsu , and westward to Xi'an ( Chang ' an ) , Shaanxi , as well as to western Shaanxi . Zhengzhou thus became a major rail junction and a regional center for cotton , grain , peanuts , and other agricultural produce . Early in 1923 a workers ' strike began in Zhengzhou and spread along the rail line before it was suppressed ; a 14-story double tower in the center of the city commemorates the strike . On June 10 , 1938 , Chiang Kai-shek 's National Revolutionary Army opened up the dikes retaining the Yellow River at Huayuankou between Zhengzhou and Kaifeng , in an effort to stem the tide of invading Japanese ; however , the ensuing 1938 Yellow River flood also killed hundreds of thousands of Chinese

		CONTEXT=Tongan Daopi ( ; ) was a Zen Buddhist monk during the end of the Tang Dynasty and the beginning of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period . Very little is known about him . Traditional biographies record that he was the abbot of Tongan Monastery on Mount Fengchi near modern Nanchang . The earliest source of information on monks of this era is the Zutang ji ( Patriarch 's Hall Record ) , which was completed in 952 , but it fails to mention Tongan Daopi as a disciple of his supposed teacher Yunju Daoying . The Zutang ji does , however , record someone with the name Tongan asking a question to Yunju Daoying . The scholar Ui Hakuju has written this could likely refer to Tongan Daopi . He is first explicitly mentioned in the Transmission of the Lamp , which was compiled around 1004 . However , in that work , it does not mention Tongan Daopi as having any disciples . The commonly accepted version of his lineage holds that Tongan Guanzhi is Tongan Daopi 's successor . However , this comes from Huihong 's Sengbao zhuan , which was completed in 1119 , much longer after Tongan 's death than the other works . The Transmission of the Lamp instead claims that Tongan Guanzhi is the disciple of a Tongan Wei , in turn a student of Jufeng Puman , with Jufeng being an apparently obscure student of the famous Dongshan Liangjie . Both Tongan Wei and Jufeng Puman are listed for the first time in the Transmission of the Lamp , and neither with much information . However , Dayang Jingxuan , who in Huihong 's version of the lineage is a descendant of Tonagan Daopi , is recorded in the Transmission of the Lamp as being descended through Jufeng Puman and Tongan Wei . Dayang was close with Wang Shu , one of the compilers of Transmission of the Lamp , suggesting that it is unlikely that an error would have been made therein about his lineage . This suggests that Tongan Guanzhi is much more likely to have been a student of Tongan Wei and not Tongan Daopi as commonly accepted .

		CONTEXT=The Dingzhou '' Analects '' was damaged in a fire shortly after it was entombed in the Han dynasty . It was further damaged in an earthquake shortly after it was recovered , and the surviving text is just under half the size of the received text of the '' Analects '' . Of the sections that survive , the Dingzhou '' Analects '' is shorter than the received '' Analects '' , implying that the text of the '' Analects '' was still in the process of expansion when the Dingzhou '' Analects '' was entombed . There was evidence that " additions " may have been made to the manuscript after it had been completed , indicating that the writer may have become aware of at least one other version of the '' Analects '' and included " extra " material for the sake of completeness

		CONTEXT=The name Zhengzhou came from the Sui dynasty ( AD 581 ) , even though it was located in Chenggao , another town . The government moved to the contemporary city during the Tang dynasty . It achieved its greatest importance under the Sui ( AD 581 – 618 ) , Tang ( 618 – 907 ) , and early Song ( 960 – 1127 ) dynasties , when it was the terminus of the New Bian Canal , which joined the Yellow River to the northwest . There , at a place called Heyin , a vast granary complex was established to supply the capitals at Luoyang and Chang ' an to the west and the frontier armies to the north . In the Song period , however , the transfer of the capital eastward to Kaifeng robbed Zhengzhou of much of its importance . It was a capital during the five dynasties of Xia , Shang , Guan , Zheng , and Han , and a prefecture during the eight dynasties of Sui , Tang , Five Dynasties , Song , Jin , Yuan , Ming , and Qing . In 1903 the Beijing – Hankou Railway arrived at Zhengzhou , and in 1909 the first stage of the Longhai Railway gave it an east – west link to Kaifeng and Luoyang ; it later was extended eastward to the coast at Lianyungang , Jiangsu , and westward to Xi'an ( Chang ' an ) , Shaanxi , as well as to western Shaanxi . Zhengzhou thus became a major rail junction and a regional center for cotton , grain , peanuts , and other agricultural produce . Early in 1923 a workers ' strike began in Zhengzhou and spread along the rail line before it was suppressed ; a 14-story double tower in the center of the city commemorates the strike .

		CONTEXT=The Huanglan or Imperial Mirror was the oldest Chinese encyclopedia or leishu " classified dictionary " . Cao Pi , the first emperor of the Wei , ordered its compilation upon his accession to the throne in 220 and it was completed in 222 . The purpose of the Huanglan was to provide the emperor and ministers of state with conveniently arranged summaries of all that was known at the time . Complete versions of the Huanglan existed until the Song dynasty ( 960-1279 ) , when it became a lost work , although some quotations did survive in other encyclopedias and anthologies . The Huanglan was the prototype of the classified encyclopedia and served as a model for later ones such as the ( 624 ) Tang Yiwen Leiju and the ( 1408 ) Ming Yongle dadian .

		CONTEXT=Ji or Jicheng was an ancient city in northern China , which has become the longest continuously inhabited section of modern Beijing . Historical mention of Ji dates to the founding of the Zhou dynasty in about 1045BC . Archaeological finds in southwestern Beijing where Ji was believed to be located date to the Spring and Autumn period ( 771 – 476BC ) . The city of Ji served as the capital of the ancient states of Ji and Yan until the unification of China by the Qin dynasty in 221BC . Thereafter , the city was a prefectural capital for Youzhou through the Han dynasty , Three Kingdoms , Western Jin dynasty , Sixteen Kingdoms , Northern Dynasties , and Sui dynasty . With the creation of a Jizhou during the Tang dynasty in what is now Tianjin Municipality , the city of Ji took on the name Youzhou . Youzhou was one of the Sixteen Prefectures ceded to the Khitans during the Five Dynasties . The city then became the southern capital of the Liao dynasty and then main capital of the Jin dynasty ( 1115 – 1234 ) . In the 13th century , Kublai Khan built a new capital city for the Yuan dynasty adjacent to Ji to the north . The old city of Ji became a suburb to Dadu . In the Ming dynasty , the old and new cities were merged by Beijing 's Ming - era city wall .

The 111 CE Book of Han history is the earliest extant source to mention the Heguanzi , yet the next reliable sources referring to it date from the early 6th century . In 805 , the influential Tang dynasty writer Liu Zongyuan found a copy of the Heguanzi and disparaged it as a post-Han apocryphal forgery . His opinion was widely accepted by scholars for the next twelve centuries , during which the text was seldom read and infrequently mentioned . Then , in 1973 , Chinese archeologists unearthed the 2nd - century BCE Han dynasty Mawangdui Silk Texts , including the previously unknown Huang - Lao Silk Manuscripts , which have many passages similar and identical with the Heguanzi , leading to renewed studies into its textual history and philosophical significance .

		GOLD_MENTION=1938 Yellow River flood
		CONTEXT=The name Zhengzhou came from the Sui dynasty ( AD 581 ) , even though it was located in Chenggao , another town . The government moved to the contemporary city during the Tang dynasty . It achieved its greatest importance under the Sui ( AD 581 – 618 ) , Tang ( 618 – 907 ) , and early Song ( 960 – 1127 ) dynasties , when it was the terminus of the New Bian Canal , which joined the Yellow River to the northwest . There , at a place called Heyin , a vast granary complex was established to supply the capitals at Luoyang and Chang ' an to the west and the frontier armies to the north . In the Song period , however , the transfer of the capital eastward to Kaifeng robbed Zhengzhou of much of its importance . It was a capital during the five dynasties of Xia , Shang , Guan , Zheng , and Han , and a prefecture during the eight dynasties of Sui , Tang , Five Dynasties , Song , Jin , Yuan , Ming , and Qing . In 1903 the Beijing – Hankou Railway arrived at Zhengzhou , and in 1909 the first stage of the Longhai Railway gave it an east – west link to Kaifeng and Luoyang ; it later was extended eastward to the coast at Lianyungang , Jiangsu , and westward to Xi'an ( Chang ' an ) , Shaanxi , as well as to western Shaanxi . Zhengzhou thus became a major rail junction and a regional center for cotton , grain , peanuts , and other agricultural produce . Early in 1923 a workers ' strike began in Zhengzhou and spread along the rail line before it was suppressed ; a 14-story double tower in the center of the city commemorates the strike . On June 10 , 1938 , Chiang Kai-shek 's National Revolutionary Army opened up the dikes retaining the Yellow River at Huayuankou between Zhengzhou and Kaifeng , in an effort to stem the tide of invading Japanese ; however , the ensuing 1938 Yellow River flood also killed hundreds of thousands of Chinese

		CONTEXT=The Battle of Guìlíng ( 桂陵之戰 ) was fought between the states of Qí and Wei in the Warring States period of Chinese history . In 354 BC , an army from Wèi was laying siege to Handan , the capital of the State of Zhao . The next year , Zhao turned to Qi for help . Tian Ji and Sun Bin , acting as co-commanders of Qi , led an army to save Zhao . Sun Bin moves south intentionally to make an unsuccessful attack on Pingling , intending to convince Pang Juan that the Qi Army was too weak to achieve victory . Pang Juan , falling for the ruse , pooled more of his forces to besiege Handan . Although defeated , the Zhao Army fought desperately and suffered heavy losses to the Wei Army in the subsequent battle . After feigning defeat at Pingling , Sun Bin led his army directly to the Wei capital , Daliang . Wei scouts reported that the Qi Army had committed small groups to attack the city . Upon hearing the report , Wei general Pang Juan took his crack cavalry and left his infantry and supplies at Handan , making a mad dash in an attempt rescue Daliang . Pang Juan 's troops were exhausted as they crossed the Yellow River and were ambushed and destroyed at Guiling by Sun 's numerically superior army . Pang Juan managed to escape alone to Wei . This battle gives rise to a well - known proverb , " Besiege Wei to rescue Zhao " ( 圍魏救趙 ) , which is also included as one of the Thirty - Six Strategies .

		CONTEXT=Hull Castle was an artillery fort in Kingston upon Hull in England . Together with two supporting blockhouses , it defended the eastern side of the River Hull , and was constructed by King Henry VIII to protect against attack from France as part of his Device programme in 1542 . The castle had two large , curved bastions and a rectangular keep at its centre ; the blockhouses to the north and south had three curved bastions supporting guns , and a curtain wall and moat linked the blockhouses and castle . The construction project used material from recently dissolved monasteries , and cost £ 21,056 . The town took over responsibility for these defences in 1553 , leading to a long running dispute with the Crown as to whether the civic authorities were fulfilling their responsibilities to maintain them .

		CONTEXT=Southsea Castle , historically also known as Chaderton Castle , South Castle and Portsea Castle , is an artillery fort originally constructed by Henry VIII on Portsea Island , Hampshire , in 1544 . It formed part of the King 's Device programme to protect against invasion from France and the Holy Roman Empire , and defended the Solent and the eastern approach to Portsmouth . The castle had a square central keep , two rectangular gun platforms to the east and west , and two angled bastions to the front and rear , and was an early English example of the trace italienne - style of fortification popular on the Continent . The Cowdray engraving of the Battle of the Solent in 1545 depicted Henry VIII visiting the castle . Despite several serious fires , it remained in service and saw brief action at the start of the English Civil War in 1642 when it was stormed by Parliamentary forces .

		CONTEXT=The Pilgrim 's Tale is an English anti-monastic poem . It was probably written ca. 1536 – 38 , since it makes references to events in 1534 and 1536 – i.e. , the Lincolnshire Rebellion – and borrows from The Plowman 's Tale and the 1532 text by William Thynne of Chaucer 's Romaunt of the Rose , which is cited by page and line . It remains the most mysterious of the pseudo - Chaucerian texts . In his 1602 edition of the Works of Chaucer , Thomas Speght mentions that he hoped to find this elusive text . A prefatory advertisement to the reader in the 1687 edition of the Works speaks of an exhaustive search for The Pilgrim 's Tale , which had proved fruitless

Bakri then stated that he had become a Salafi Muslim . Media outlets and British Muslims criticised him for his open support for various international jihadist organisations . On 13 September 2001 , Bakri told the '' Daily Mail '' , " When I first heard about the September 11 , 2001 attacks , there was some initial delight about such an attack . I received a phone call and said , ' Oh , wow , the United States has come under attack . ' It was exciting . " According to '' The Times '' , Bakri was left alone by British law prior to July 2005 despite actions such as an issuing a fatwa " containing a death threat against President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan " because : Bakri , who acts as al-Muhajiroun 's spiritual leader , insisted that his followers obey a " covenant of security " which , while encouraging terror abroad , forbade them from carrying out attacks in Britain . But " the authorities may have been lulled into a false sense of security " , because the covenant was not permanent . In November 2004 Bakri disbanded Al-Muhajiroun , saying that " all Muslims should unite together against a hostile West . " Three months later Bakri said this " covenant of security " was no longer in force having been violated by the British government . " Experts note , " according to the Times , that the July London bombings followed " four months later "

		CONTEXT=According to the '' New York Post '' critic , Elisabeth Vincentelli , the show improved with its transfer from Off-Broadway to Broadway , especially Weaver 's performance , which Vincentelli deemed the weakest . Weaver portrayed a movie star who was " overindulgent , self-centered , and unaware she ’s on the decline . " Mark Kennedy of '' The Washington Post '' suggested Durang , with whom Weaver graduated from the Yale School of Drama in 1974 , may have written the role for her . Both Hyde Pierce and Nielsen exhibited mastery of their monologues , according to Vincentelli : " Hyde Pierce is a master of the slow burn , while Nielsen ’s wild-eyed Sonia often looks as if her train of thought has a loose caboose . " Vincentelli also noted that Weaver 's character had " turned her life into a performance . " The play received six Tony Award nominations for the 67th Tony Awards , winning the Tony Award for Best Play . Magnussen earned his first Tony nomination for his role . Grant also earned her first Tony nomination . The play won the 58th Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Play and the 2013 New York Drama Critics ' Circle Award for Best Play . Grant received a Theatre World Award for Best Debut Performance . Emily Rebholz earned a 2013 Lucille Lortel Award nomination for Outstanding Costume Design of the Off-Broadway production

		CONTEXT=Critical opinion regarding the film has been overwhelmingly positive . '' The Village Voice '' critic J. Hoberman , who in 1981 included the film in his list of the ten best films commercially released in the United States during that year , more recently wrote that the film is one " of the richest avant-garde features of the 1970s " and praised its " winning combination of sexual frankness and visual wit , " while another critic , Dennis Schwartz , wrote that the " film 's beauty is derived from its sexual frankness and playfully drawn out intimate relationship scenes , witty use of photography , and its originality as it breaks free of conventional unities of body , space and time . Export skillfully edits montage and integrates video , still photography , and performance art with elements from Cubism , Surrealism , Dada and avant-garde cinema . " '' Artforum '' noted in November 1980 that " w atching their scenes together , we realize how seldom , if ever before , the details of sexual intimacy have been shown in film from the point of view from a woman . Export privileges rupture over unity and never settles for one-dimensional solutions " and it was called one " of the most original films in this year 's exposition " and a " tour de force of cinematic invention " grounded in the director 's " fresh and intelligent sensibility , characteristically self-referential . Her visual resources include mirrors , still photography , video , dance , and films within the film , all employed with a bold and surprising inventiveness " by the catalogue notes of the 1978 Los Angeles International Film Exposition . Similarly , critic Alison Butler wrote that the " film is a witty and visually brilliant essay on gender and experience , culture and environment " and program notes used by the San Francisco Cinematheque during a screening quote critic Amy Taubin as opining that the film " makes you reconsider what you and everyone else is doing — in life and in art " and critic Steve Anker underscoring that it is an important " crossover film " combining " avant-garde and theatrical sensibilities , made during the mid-1970s . It chronicles the nightmarish breakdown of a fashion photographer as she confronts her waning identity and security as a career woman ; blending narrative experimentation , fantasy , fact and theoretical critique , it has enormous impact on independent features which followed it . " PopMatters noted that the film has " enough originality to nag at patient viewers and get at least partially under our skin " and critic Michael Atkinson wrote that it is a " weird , restless , beguilingly offbeat bit of dreamwork . " The film was presented for the first time at the Berlin International Film Festival in 1977 , it has won a Special Jury Prize at the Venice Film Festival and was recently called " seminal " during a screening at a repertory cinema , " a strong and humoristic showdown " at another and " a sonically-complex , montage-rich , darkly funny and uriniferous cornerstone of avant-garde cinema " during a screening at a New York University class . Critic Peter Hajek wrote in the Austrian newspaper '' Kurier '' that " Valie Export presents this psychopanoptic view of the present in solid , striking images and often in unexpected humorous passages . " Critic Chris Holmlund , author of the scholarly article " Feminist Makeovers : The Celluloid Surgery of Valie Export and Su Friedrich , " referred to '' Invisible Adversaries '' as a feminist version of '' Invasion of the Body Snatchers '' , noted that the film includes references to famous paintings and to '' Un Chien Andalou '' , and wrote that therefore it " is visually rick , entertaining , striking , but also demanding . " A few reviews , however , were negative . For example , London 's '' Time Out '' wrote about the film that it is " n ot unlike '' W.R. : Mysteries of the Organism '' " and that it will " probably age as badly " and a reviewer for '' The Heights '' wrote that " I was expecting a great feminist work here , but got mediocrity . I can not recommend that you see this film , " though he nevertheless praised the film as a " cornucopia of video spectacle in which Export delights , confounds and amuses the audience with her antics .

		CONTEXT=Although Greece had been granted a spot in the 2008 final because of its seventh-place finish at the Eurovision Song Contest 2007 , it had to compete in a semi-final for the first time since 2004 because of new rules put into effect by the European Broadcasting Union ( EBU ) . In previous years , countries that received a top 10 placing were automatically granted a spot in the next year 's final without having to compete in a semi-final , but for 2008 , the EBU changed the automatic qualification regulations so that all countries except the " Big 4 " ( France , Germany , Spain , and the United Kingdom ) and host country , would have to pass through one of two semi-finals . The EBU split up countries with a friendly voting history into separate semi-finals , to give a better chance for other countries to win . Greece and Cyprus had often been accused of favoring each other , with each awarding the other the maximum number of points ( twelve ) at the previous contest . On January 28 , 2008 , the EBU held a special draw which determined that Greece would be in '' Semi-final 1 '' held on May 20 , 2008 in Belgrade , Serbia ; Cyprus was subsequently placed in the second semi-final

		CONTEXT=Although Greece had been granted a spot in the 2008 final because of its seventh-place finish at the Eurovision Song Contest 2007 , it had to compete in a semi-final for the first time since 2004 because of new rules put into effect by the European Broadcasting Union ( EBU ) . In previous years , countries that received a top 10 placing were automatically granted a spot in the next year 's final without having to compete in a semi-final , but for 2008 , the EBU changed the automatic qualification regulations so that all countries except the " Big 4 " ( France , Germany , Spain , and the United Kingdom ) and host country , would have to pass through one of two semi-finals . The EBU split up countries with a friendly voting history into separate semi-finals , to give a better chance for other countries to win . Greece and Cyprus had often been accused of favoring each other , with each awarding the other the maximum number of points ( twelve ) at the previous contest . On January 28 , 2008 , the EBU held a special draw which determined that Greece would be in '' Semi-final 1 '' held on May 20 , 2008 in Belgrade , Serbia ; Cyprus was subsequently placed in the second semi-final

		CONTEXT=jurors of the Eurovision Song Contest 2009 play a large role in the voting process of the Contest . For the final round , each country 's votes will be decided by a combination of 50 % televoting by the public and 50 % by national jury . The method of selecting the semi-final qualifiers will remain the same as in past years , however , with nine countries in each semi-final which qualified based on the televoting results , and a tenth coming from the juries . In response to some broadcasters ' continued complaints about politically charged , neighbourly and diaspora voting , the European Broadcasting Union ( EBU ) evaluated the voting procedure used in the contest , and contemplated a change for 2009 . Contest organisers sent a questionnaire regarding the voting system to participating broadcasters , and a reference group incorporated the responses into their suggestions for next year 's format . Telewizja Polska ( TVP ) , the Polish broadcaster , suggested that an international jury similar to the one used in the 2008 Eurovision Dance Contest be introduced in the Eurovision Song Contest to lessen the impact of neighbourly voting and place more emphasis on the artistic value of the song . A jury would lead to less political and diaspora voting as the jury members , mandated to be music industry experts , would also have a say in addition to " random members of the public " . National juries were originally phased out of the contest beginning in 1997 , with televoting becoming mandatory for nearly all participants since 2003

The event was to be held on 16 October 2005 at the Royal Albert Hall in London , England . The BBC was to be the host broadcaster for the concert . The Royal Albert Hall was reportedly unavailable , so in August 2004 the EBU announced that DR would stage the event instead . Eurovision Song Contest supervisor Svante Stockselius said that Denmark 's previous experience of hosting Eurovision events ( the 2001 Contest and the first Junior Eurovision Song Contest in 2003 ) were influential in the Union 's choice . The event was codenamed '' Extravaganza '' . 1998 Eurovision winner Dana International , who appeared at the event , later went to suggest that the reason behind the change of host country was also due to the fact that the BBC wanted to present the show " with humour " as though to poke fun at the Contest , an idea that proved to be less popular with the EBU . The BBC went on to broadcast their own 50th anniversary program , '' Boom Bang-a-Bang : 50 Years of Eurovision '' , in May 2006

		CONTEXT=Although Greece had been granted a spot in the 2008 final because of its seventh-place finish at the Eurovision Song Contest 2007 , it had to compete in a semi-final for the first time since 2004 because of new rules put into effect by the European Broadcasting Union ( EBU ) . In previous years , countries that received a top 10 placing were automatically granted a spot in the next year 's final without having to compete in a semi-final , but for 2008 , the EBU changed the automatic qualification regulations so that all countries except the " Big 4 " ( France , Germany , Spain , and the United Kingdom ) and host country , would have to pass through one of two semi-finals . The EBU split up countries with a friendly voting history into separate semi-finals , to give a better chance for other countries to win . Greece and Cyprus had often been accused of favoring each other , with each awarding the other the maximum number of points ( twelve ) at the previous contest . On January 28 , 2008 , the EBU held a special draw which determined that Greece would be in '' Semi-final 1 '' held on May 20 , 2008 in Belgrade , Serbia ; Cyprus was subsequently placed in the second semi-final

		CONTEXT=Members from Incursa went on to form punk icons False Start and Goodnight Nurse , which McCarthy still belongs to as a guitarist . Arts and McCarthy then formed Kids of 88 . In releasing the first Kids of 88 album , Sugarpills , McCarthy said that the duo tried to produce a variety of material rather than just the familiarly slutty " My House " and " Just A Little Bit " ( released earlier as singles ) . Their style is broadly a fusion of electropop and 1980 's style dance music . They describe it as " a cross between a late 80 's police drama intro theme and a sophisticated super hussy " . A reviewer has said " while reminiscent of early 80s synthpop , they are n't a direct copy of their antecedents . There 's also a touch of 2010 punk swagger and adrenaline , where dance ca n't ignore what 's been achieved in R&B and hip-hop " . McCarthy and Arts produced the album themselves and worked with a simple technical set-up out of a bedroom . At the 2010 New Zealand Music Awards , Kids of 88 won " Single of the Year " and ( with Tim Van Dammen ) " Music Video of the Year " for their single Just a Little Bit

		CONTEXT=In his analysis of the group 's influence on 21st century popular culture two decades after their debut , John Mckie of the BBC noted that while other stars had used brand endorsements in the past , " the Spice brand was the first to propel the success of the band " . '' The Guardian '' 's Sylvia Patterson also wrote of what she called the Spice Girls ' true legacy : " T hey were the original pioneers of the band as brand , of pop as a ruthless marketing ruse , of the merchandising and sponsorship deals that have dominated commercial pop ever since . " The mainstream media embraced the Spice Girls at the peak of their success . The group received regular international press coverage and were constantly followed by paparazzi . Paul Gorman of '' Music Week '' said of the media interest in the Spice Girls in the late 1990s : " They inaugurated the era of cheesy celebrity obsession which pertains today . There is lineage from them to the Kardashianisation not only of the music industry , but the wider culture . " The '' Irish Independent 's '' Tanya Sweeney agreed that " t he vapidity of paparazzi culture could probably be traced back to the Spice Girls ' naked ambitions " , while Mckie predicted that , " f or all that modern stars from Katy Perry to Lionel Messi exploit brand endorsements and attract tabloid coverage , the scale of the Spice Girls ' breakthrough in 1996 is unlikely to be repeated — at least not by a music act . " The Spice Girls have been revered as the biggest pop phenomenon of the 1990s due to their international record sales , iconic symbolism and " omnipresence " in the late 1990s . At the 2000 Brit Awards , the group received the Outstanding Contribution to Music award to mark their dominance of the global music scene in the 1990s . The iconic symbolism of the Spice Girls in the 1990s is partly attributed to their era-defining outfits , the most notable being the Union Jack dress that Geri Halliwell wore at the 1997 Brit Awards . The dress has achieved iconic status , becoming one of the most prominent symbols of 1990s pop culture . The status of the Spice Girls as 1990s pop icons is also attributed to their vast merchandising and willingness to be a part of a media-driven world . Their unprecedented appearances in adverts and the media solidified the group as a phenomenon — an icon of the decade and for British music

		CONTEXT=Members from Incursa went on to form punk icons False Start and Goodnight Nurse , which McCarthy still belongs to as a guitarist . Arts and McCarthy then formed Kids of 88 . In releasing the first Kids of 88 album , Sugarpills , McCarthy said that the duo tried to produce a variety of material rather than just the familiarly slutty " My House " and " Just A Little Bit " ( released earlier as singles ) . Their style is broadly a fusion of electropop and 1980 's style dance music . They describe it as " a cross between a late 80 's police drama intro theme and a sophisticated super hussy " . A reviewer has said " while reminiscent of early 80s synthpop , they are n't a direct copy of their antecedents . There 's also a touch of 2010 punk swagger and adrenaline , where dance ca n't ignore what 's been achieved in R&B and hip-hop " . McCarthy and Arts produced the album themselves and worked with a simple technical set-up out of a bedroom . At the 2010 New Zealand Music Awards , Kids of 88 won " Single of the Year " and ( with Tim Van Dammen ) " Music Video of the Year " for their single Just a Little Bit

		CONTEXT='' In Through the Out Door '' divided contemporary critics and Led Zeppelin fans ; some found its synthesizer-influenced music inevitable but forward-thinking while others felt the band had forsaken their heavy , fast sound . According to Jimmy Page biographer Martin Power , " predictably , in the wake of punk , '' In Through the Out Door '' received a rough ride from some critics , with Zep 's veteran status in the music business now used as a stick with which to beat them . " Reviewing the album in '' Rolling Stone '' , Charles M. Young said Page 's diminishing creativity resulted in little good material to work with for Plant , whose lyrics Young found inane , and Bonham , whose drumming was viewed as heavy handed . This brought to the forefront the keyboard playing of Jones , who Young said " functions best behind Page , not in front of him " . Chris Bohn from '' Melody Maker '' said " the impressionable first play " of the record " had everyone in the office rolling around laughing " , while accusing the band of being " totally out of touch " and " displaying the first intimations of mortality " . By contrast , '' NME '' journalist Nick Kent argued that the album was " no epitaph " , believing its " potential points of departure " deserved further listening . Robert Christgau also wrote positively of the record in '' The Village Voice '' , observing the usual " lax in the lyrics department " , but regarding the album as the group 's best since '' Houses of the Holy '' ( 1973 ) . He said " the tuneful synthesizer pomp on side two confirms my long-held belief that this is a real good art-rock band " , while " the lollapalooza hooks on the first side confirms the world 's long-held belief that this is a real good hard rock band " . At the end of the year , '' In Through the Out Door '' was nominated for the 1980 American Music Awards , in the category of " Favorite Pop/Rock Album "

Later , in September 2014 , Spears posted a picture of herself in the studio , hinting that she was recording new music .

In 2015 , she released the song " Pretty Girls " with Iggy Azalea , however the song was met with moderate impact and Spears headed back to the studio to record more songs , but did n't have plans to release a new album . In November 2015 , Spears teased on her Instagram account that she was working with songwriters Justin Tranter and Julia Michaels , by posting a picture of them looking " bemused " with the caption : " Working hard and hardly working ... new album ... wheeeee ! . " A month later , Tranter gave an interview for website NewNowNext about his work with Spears and commented : " Working with Britney is a fucking dream . She is so sweet , so inspiring and a master on the mic . Me and Julia had to leave the studio one day because our screams of excitement after every take she did were distracting the producers . " In late 2016 , during interviews to promote the album , Spears declared that she wanted to explore new things on the record , and that it was her " most hip-hop album , " explaining : " ... there are like two or three songs that go in the direction of more urban that I 've wanted to do for a long time now , and I just have n't really done that .

Bianca Gracie of '' Fuse '' opined that the song reminded her of " the glory days ( no pun intended ) of ' Circus ' and ' Femme Fatale ' . " Lyrically , " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is a flirty song about Spears " offer ing several reasons why her lover should come over and options , which can be seen in the lines " Nobody should be alone if they do n't have to be " and " I could get into that kissin ' and touchin ' / Or we could be good and do next to nothin ' . " Amy Roberts of '' Bustle '' noted that the lyrics are about hooking up , adding that they " celebrate the idea that casual relationships do n't need to be lacking respect or understanding . You do n't have to be in love with , or committing to , the person that you 're hooking up with , but that also does n't mean that you ca n't connect with them on a different level than just sex . In fact , Spears makes it clear that it 's kind of even cool if her hook-up does n't want to have sex . Her partner can draw the boundaries of where the massage she 's offering starts and ends , and if it remains as nothing more than a back rub then so be it – that 's totally cool .

" utilizes the best of Spears ' talents . ... " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " embraces the current trend for songs that are musically complicated , that layer up their beats and sound effects , and feature multiple voices and infectious shouting during their choruses .

Later , on September 1 , 2016 , a performance of the song was broadcast from Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas for Today .

Blickensderfer was the nephew of the inventor of the stenotype John Celivergos Zachos . Two models were initially unveiled to the public at the 1893 World 's Columbian Exposition in Chicago , the Model 1 and the Model 5 . His machines were originally intended to compete with larger Remington , Hammond and Yost typewriters , and were the first truly portable , full - keyboard typewriters . The design also enabled the typist to see the typed work at a time when most typewriters were understrike machines that concealed the writing . When Blickensderfer unveiled his small Model 5 at the 1893 World 's Fair , a stripped - down version of his larger more complex Model 1 machine , these revolutionary features attracted huge crowds and a full order book – many of them from Britain , Germany and France , whose business machine markets were more highly developed than the United States .

		CONTEXT=The Battle of Crete ( , also Unternehmen Merkur , " Operation Mercury " , ) was fought during the Second World War on the Greek island of Crete . It began on the morning of 20 May 1941 , when Nazi Germany began an airborne invasion of Crete . Greek and other Allied forces , along with Cretan civilians , defended the island . [ 11 ] After one day of fighting , the Germans had suffered heavy casualties and the Allied troops were confident that they would defeat the invasion . The next day , through communication failures , Allied tactical hesitation , and German offensive operations , Maleme Airfield in western Crete fell , enabling the Germans to land reinforcements and overwhelm the defensive positions on the north of the island . Allied forces withdrew to the south coast . More than half were evacuated by the British Royal Navy and the remainder surrendered or joined the Cretan resistance . The defence of Crete evolved into a costly naval engagement ; by the end of the campaign the Royal Navy 's eastern Mediterranean strength had been reduced to only two battleships and three cruisers .

		CONTEXT=The 43rd Guards Rifle Division was formed as an elite infantry division of the Red Army in October , 1942 , based on the 1st formation of the 201st Rifle Division , and served in that role until after the end of the Great Patriotic War . The 201st was the only division made up of Latvian nationals in the Red Army until 1944 , and the 43rd was immediately nicknamed the " Latvian Guards " division , which stuck through its existence . Formed in Northwestern Front , its initial service was in the dismal fighting around the Demyansk salient until that was evacuated by German Army Group North in February , 1943 . Through the rest of the year it fought in that Front , mostly facing the several German strongpoints in the area of Velikiye Luki . Beginning in January , 1944 the division took part in the offensive that finally drove the German forces away from Leningrad and before the summer offensive , now in 22nd Army of 2nd Baltic Front it provided a cadre to form the 130th Latvian Rifle Corps , and it served in that Corps for the duration of the war . Through 1943 and into 1944 the division was able to remain closer to full strength than many other Soviet units because it drew on a relatively large pool of Latvian refugee Communist Party members and Komsomol who had escaped ahead of the Germans in 1941 . It crossed the border back into Latvia in July and entered Riga on October 16 , winning a battle honor in the process . For the duration of the war the 43rd Guards served mostly in Leningrad Front , containing and reducing the German forces trapped in the Courland Pocket , and also engaging in restoration work in its war - battered homeland . It continued to serve in this manner until it was converted to a rifle brigade in April , 1947 .

		GOLD_MENTION=Son Thang massacre
		CONTEXT=It was estimated that around 220,000 civilians killed by US/ARVN operations were miscounted as " enemy KIA " as when free-fire zones were declared it was erroneously assumed all individuals were enemy combatants For official US military operations reports , there are no distinctions between enemy KIA and civilian KIA since it was assumed by US forces that an area declared a free-fire zone that all individuals killed regardless of whether they were combatants or civilians were considered enemy KIA . Since body counts was a direct measure of operational success this often caused US battle reports to list civilians killed as enemy KIA . The inclusion of civilians killed led to the enormous discrepancy between weapons seized and " enemy KIA " during Operation Speedy Express , with nearly 10,000 enemy KIA with just 748 weapons found . Most of the those counted as " enemy killed " were unarmed civilians . The My Lai Massacre and Son Thang massacre both reported women and children killed as " enemy combatants "

		CONTEXT=Deol decided to join the acting line of her parents and became a second-generation actress . She started her acting career in a lead role with Vinay Shukla 's '' Koi Mere Dil Se Poochhe '' ( 2002 ) opposite Aftab Shivdasani , with Sanjay Kapoor , Jaya Bachchan and Anupam Kher playing supporting roles . This movie was a box office failure . Deol received mixed reactions from critics upon her performance . Savera R Someshwar of Rediff wrote " Esha , as a person , exudes a confidence that almost borders on arrogance . She 's athletic and seems perfectly capable of looking after herself in any situation . Esha , on screen , is required to convey three emotions : Love , sorrow and fear . Especially fear . No wonder she flounders . She is just unable to look terrorised . Even her alleged romance with costar Aftab has not helped her shed her stern demeanour in her romantic scenes . " Rakesh Budhu of Planet Bollywood wrote " She is n’t horrible , but given the hype , the demands and of course , comparisons , she surely is n’t up to the mark . Koi Mere Dil Se Poochhe is just plain old mediocre in such a way that you end up noticing the flaws in Esha ’s performance more . Her facial expressions need work , her attitude is beautiful but she seems too stern when it is not required . Of course , she is nowhere close to being a washout and if you are her fan you can appreciate the other aspects of her performances without completely losing faith in her future projects . " Despite mixed reactions and box office failure , Deol won numerous awards for her performance including the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut at the 48th Filmfare Awards

		CONTEXT=The show received a mixed reception from media publications . On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes , the show holds an approval rating of 43 % based on 30 critics , and summarized , " The 90th Academy Awards played it safe and hit no major snags -- but by clocking in at over four hours , returning host Jimmy Kimmel and company wore out their welcome long before the surprise ending . " Hank Stuever of '' The Washington Post '' marked , " In his second year , Kimmel has shown that the telecast need n't be anything but sharp and sure , with a funny host whose bits are manageable , shareable and – best of all – forgotten . We 're not making showbiz history here ; we 're just trying to get through another Oscar night . " Chief critic David Edelstein of '' Vulture '' wrote , " This was the best , most inspiring , and most sheerly likable Academy Awards telecast I 've ever seen . ... It was also – in terms of the actual awards – among the most disappointing . " '' Vanity Fair '' s , Richard Lawson wrote , " As a host , Kimmel struck a careful , appropriately measured tone ... All told , Sunday 's ceremony did an admirable job of recognizing all the turmoil surrounding it while maintaining the silly , chintzy trappings that so many of us tune into the Oscars for . " CNN 's Brian Lowry quipped , " The Oscars are a big , unwieldy beast , which invariably try to serve too many masters . Yet if the intent was ultimately to maintain a celebratory tone without ignoring either the outside world or the elephant in the room throughout this year 's awards , host Jimmy Kimmel and the show itself largely succeeded . " Others were more critical of the show . Television critic Maureen Ryan of '' Variety '' said , " All things considered , the show had a more or less low-key vibe . Normally it takes about two hours for the numbing effect to set in , but despite host Jimmy Kimmel 's best efforts , Sunday 's telecast started to feel a bit languid and low-energy far earlier . " Television critic James Poniewozik of '' The New York Times '' said , " despite the recent upheaval in Hollywood , the ceremony at large still focused mainly on celebration and glitter literally , in the case of the blinding set , which looked as if the ceremony were encased in an enormous geode . There 's also the perennial problem of bloat . The hitch , of course , is that every part of the show has its constituency . " Darren Franich of '' Entertainment Weekly '' wrote , " What fun we had at this year 's Oscars ! Long show , sure , but where to cut it ? " Writing for '' Deadline '' Greg Evans said , " Did the nearly four-hour running time contain any moments for the Oscar ages ? Probably not . " David Wiegand of the '' San Francisco Chronicle '' wrote , " Even the hope that the noise of clapping might keep the audience at home and in the theater awake , there was little of that for anything except the entrance of actors of advance age . " '' The Oregonian '' columnist Kristi Turnquist wrote , " Was it respectful ? Absolutely . Did it make for kind of a dull , earnest Oscars show ? Yeah , kind of . " Attaining 26.5 million U.S. viewers according to Nielsen ratings , the ceremony 's telecast had a 16-percent drop in viewership from last year 's ceremony and had the lowest U.S. viewership in Oscar history . On March 6 , after the final ratings were confirmed , President Donald Trump took to his Twitter account , saying , " Lowest rated Oscars in HISTORY . Problem is , we do n't have stars anymore – except your President ( just kidding , of course ) ! " . In response , Kimmel also tweeted , saying , " Thanks , lowest rated President in HISTORY . " In July 2018 , the ceremony presentation received eight nominations for the 70th Primetime Creative Arts Emmys

		CONTEXT=The show received a mixed reception from media publications . On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes , the show holds an approval rating of 43 % based on 30 critics , and summarized , " The 90th Academy Awards played it safe and hit no major snags -- but by clocking in at over four hours , returning host Jimmy Kimmel and company wore out their welcome long before the surprise ending . " Hank Stuever of '' The Washington Post '' marked , " In his second year , Kimmel has shown that the telecast need n't be anything but sharp and sure , with a funny host whose bits are manageable , shareable and – best of all – forgotten . We 're not making showbiz history here ; we 're just trying to get through another Oscar night . " Chief critic David Edelstein of '' Vulture '' wrote , " This was the best , most inspiring , and most sheerly likable Academy Awards telecast I 've ever seen . ... It was also – in terms of the actual awards – among the most disappointing . " '' Vanity Fair '' s , Richard Lawson wrote , " As a host , Kimmel struck a careful , appropriately measured tone ... All told , Sunday 's ceremony did an admirable job of recognizing all the turmoil surrounding it while maintaining the silly , chintzy trappings that so many of us tune into the Oscars for . " CNN 's Brian Lowry quipped , " The Oscars are a big , unwieldy beast , which invariably try to serve too many masters . Yet if the intent was ultimately to maintain a celebratory tone without ignoring either the outside world or the elephant in the room throughout this year 's awards , host Jimmy Kimmel and the show itself largely succeeded . " Others were more critical of the show . Television critic Maureen Ryan of '' Variety '' said , " All things considered , the show had a more or less low-key vibe . Normally it takes about two hours for the numbing effect to set in , but despite host Jimmy Kimmel 's best efforts , Sunday 's telecast started to feel a bit languid and low-energy far earlier . " Television critic James Poniewozik of '' The New York Times '' said , " despite the recent upheaval in Hollywood , the ceremony at large still focused mainly on celebration and glitter literally , in the case of the blinding set , which looked as if the ceremony were encased in an enormous geode . There 's also the perennial problem of bloat . The hitch , of course , is that every part of the show has its constituency . " Darren Franich of '' Entertainment Weekly '' wrote , " What fun we had at this year 's Oscars ! Long show , sure , but where to cut it ? " Writing for '' Deadline '' Greg Evans said , " Did the nearly four-hour running time contain any moments for the Oscar ages ? Probably not . " David Wiegand of the '' San Francisco Chronicle '' wrote , " Even the hope that the noise of clapping might keep the audience at home and in the theater awake , there was little of that for anything except the entrance of actors of advance age . " '' The Oregonian '' columnist Kristi Turnquist wrote , " Was it respectful ? Absolutely . Did it make for kind of a dull , earnest Oscars show ? Yeah , kind of . " Attaining 26.5 million U.S. viewers according to Nielsen ratings , the ceremony 's telecast had a 16-percent drop in viewership from last year 's ceremony and had the lowest U.S. viewership in Oscar history . On March 6 , after the final ratings were confirmed , President Donald Trump took to his Twitter account , saying , " Lowest rated Oscars in HISTORY . Problem is , we do n't have stars anymore – except your President ( just kidding , of course ) ! " . In response , Kimmel also tweeted , saying , " Thanks , lowest rated President in HISTORY .

This series saw the show transition to a post-watershed time slot of 9 pm , dropping from two episodes to one week - by - week as ITV aimed to save up to £ 65 million . Producers used the post-watershed slot to introduce " darker , more gritty " storylines . DI Samantha Nixon left prior to the transition , after seven years on the show , in a special two - parter storyline that included a cameo appearance by her daughter Abigail ( Georgia Tennant ) , who was a recurring character on the show from 2002 to 2005 . A six - part storyline came as part of the end of the twice - weekly episodes , Conviction , that concluded with four cast members leaving , including Superintendent John Heaton ; DCI Jack Meadows was promoted into the role .

Fatboy was not one of them , but Stuart Heritage from '' The Guardian '' felt that he should have been , calling him " A wodge of irritating comic relief ... who is yet to serve a purpose other than making me genuinely dislike young people . ... He must go , preferably in a scene where he falls down the world 's largest flight of stairs . " Heritage later called Fatboy an " obnoxiously two-dimensional dubstep-fixated stock character transparently modelled on Jar Jar Binks . " A writer for the website Watch With Mothers called the character an asset to '' EastEnders '' , expressing pleasure that the show was trying to appeal to younger viewers , while another called him irritating and zany . A writer for '' The Northern Echo '' wondered if Fatboy , along with Leon and Zsa Zsa , brought a new injection of life into the soap or took away screen time from more established characters , and Caroline Fitton , writing for the '' Daily Mail '' , felt that Fatboy 's style of talking was a bit of a cliché . Grace Dent from '' The Guardian '' changed her opinion of Fatboy over time , saying : Julie Emery from '' Heat '' criticised Fatboy 's fashion sense , especially from the episode broadcast on 12 May 2011 , saying " We know clashing prints are soooooo this season , but really , Fatboy , they do nothing for you . And while we 're at it , stop wearing that tinny ' F ' round your neck , for flip 's sake . You 're not a gangster rapper , and anyway your real name 's Arthur . " Emery also said the storyline where Fatboy asks Mercy to marry him so she can stay in the country sounded " somewhat familiar " , as '' Coronation Street '' was featuring a similar storyline at the same time . Amy Duncan from the '' Metro '' said Fatboy was one of her favourite young characters in '' EastEnders '' and said that , with Poppy , he " bring s some much-needed light into the soap " . Vicky Prior from the '' Metro '' said that Fatboy " is easily one of the best characters in '' EastEnders '' , able to interact seamlessly with other characters , both young and old . " Norwood has received four award nominations for his portrayal of Fatboy . In May 2010 , he received a nomination in the " Best Soap Newcomer " category at the 14th TVChoice Awards , and in July he was nominated for " Best Newcomer " at the 2010 Inside Soap Awards , which he went on to win in September .

		CONTEXT=Matt Roush of '' TV Guide '' called '' Return to Zero '' , " A delicately etched and intimately powerful portrait of grief and bitter loss . Return to Zero stars a fearless Minnie Driver and the ever-affable Paul Adelstein as a couple rocked to their emotional core by the loss of their unborn child , discovered to have died in the womb shortly before the delivery date . We follow them through the wrenching procedure and recovery process with a stark realism in which husband and wife are often seen at their worst , as their once-solid relationship frays when Maggie plummets into depression and neither seem able to say or do the right things to be able to heal and move on . Though sometimes hard to watch , Zero is a compelling and beautifully acted character study that will make you care as it dramatizes a domestic tragedy with a minimum of melodrama , so rare for TV and TV-movies . " Robert Bianco of '' USA Today '' wrote , " Minnie Driver and Paul Adelstein give first-rate performances in this lovely , moving film about a couple whose marriage falters when their baby is stillborn … It 's a subject worthy of education and one that seldom gets dealt with on television . " Brian Lowry of '' Variety '' called '' Return to Zero '' " a painful portrait of devastating loss , pivoting on a performance by Minnie Driver that acutely captures those raw feelings . " He also wrote , " Hanish deftly zeroes in on how all the preparation and enthusiasm surrounding a new baby magnifies the enormity of the parents ’ pain here — as well as the different ways people cope , or do n’t , with such events . " Minnie Driver was nominated for the award for Best Actress in a Movie or Miniseries at the 4th Critics ' Choice Television Awards ( the award was won by Jessica Lange for '' American Horror Story : Coven '' ) and for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie

		CONTEXT=The show received a mixed reception from media publications . On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes , the show holds an approval rating of 43 % based on 30 critics , and summarized , " The 90th Academy Awards played it safe and hit no major snags -- but by clocking in at over four hours , returning host Jimmy Kimmel and company wore out their welcome long before the surprise ending . " Hank Stuever of '' The Washington Post '' marked , " In his second year , Kimmel has shown that the telecast need n't be anything but sharp and sure , with a funny host whose bits are manageable , shareable and – best of all – forgotten . We 're not making showbiz history here ; we 're just trying to get through another Oscar night . " Chief critic David Edelstein of '' Vulture '' wrote , " This was the best , most inspiring , and most sheerly likable Academy Awards telecast I 've ever seen . ... It was also – in terms of the actual awards – among the most disappointing . " '' Vanity Fair '' s , Richard Lawson wrote , " As a host , Kimmel struck a careful , appropriately measured tone ... All told , Sunday 's ceremony did an admirable job of recognizing all the turmoil surrounding it while maintaining the silly , chintzy trappings that so many of us tune into the Oscars for . " CNN 's Brian Lowry quipped , " The Oscars are a big , unwieldy beast , which invariably try to serve too many masters . Yet if the intent was ultimately to maintain a celebratory tone without ignoring either the outside world or the elephant in the room throughout this year 's awards , host Jimmy Kimmel and the show itself largely succeeded . " Others were more critical of the show . Television critic Maureen Ryan of '' Variety '' said , " All things considered , the show had a more or less low-key vibe . Normally it takes about two hours for the numbing effect to set in , but despite host Jimmy Kimmel 's best efforts , Sunday 's telecast started to feel a bit languid and low-energy far earlier . " Television critic James Poniewozik of '' The New York Times '' said , " despite the recent upheaval in Hollywood , the ceremony at large still focused mainly on celebration and glitter literally , in the case of the blinding set , which looked as if the ceremony were encased in an enormous geode . There 's also the perennial problem of bloat . The hitch , of course , is that every part of the show has its constituency . " Darren Franich of '' Entertainment Weekly '' wrote , " What fun we had at this year 's Oscars ! Long show , sure , but where to cut it ? " Writing for '' Deadline '' Greg Evans said , " Did the nearly four-hour running time contain any moments for the Oscar ages ? Probably not . " David Wiegand of the '' San Francisco Chronicle '' wrote , " Even the hope that the noise of clapping might keep the audience at home and in the theater awake , there was little of that for anything except the entrance of actors of advance age . " '' The Oregonian '' columnist Kristi Turnquist wrote , " Was it respectful ? Absolutely . Did it make for kind of a dull , earnest Oscars show ? Yeah , kind of . " Attaining 26.5 million U.S. viewers according to Nielsen ratings , the ceremony 's telecast had a 16-percent drop in viewership from last year 's ceremony and had the lowest U.S. viewership in Oscar history . On March 6 , after the final ratings were confirmed , President Donald Trump took to his Twitter account , saying , " Lowest rated Oscars in HISTORY . Problem is , we do n't have stars anymore – except your President ( just kidding , of course ) ! " . In response , Kimmel also tweeted , saying , " Thanks , lowest rated President in HISTORY . " In July 2018 , the ceremony presentation received eight nominations for the 70th Primetime Creative Arts Emmys

		CONTEXT=The show received a mixed reception from media publications . On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes , the show holds an approval rating of 43 % based on 30 critics , and summarized , " The 90th Academy Awards played it safe and hit no major snags -- but by clocking in at over four hours , returning host Jimmy Kimmel and company wore out their welcome long before the surprise ending . " Hank Stuever of '' The Washington Post '' marked , " In his second year , Kimmel has shown that the telecast need n't be anything but sharp and sure , with a funny host whose bits are manageable , shareable and – best of all – forgotten . We 're not making showbiz history here ; we 're just trying to get through another Oscar night . " Chief critic David Edelstein of '' Vulture '' wrote , " This was the best , most inspiring , and most sheerly likable Academy Awards telecast I 've ever seen . ... It was also – in terms of the actual awards – among the most disappointing . " '' Vanity Fair '' s , Richard Lawson wrote , " As a host , Kimmel struck a careful , appropriately measured tone ... All told , Sunday 's ceremony did an admirable job of recognizing all the turmoil surrounding it while maintaining the silly , chintzy trappings that so many of us tune into the Oscars for . " CNN 's Brian Lowry quipped , " The Oscars are a big , unwieldy beast , which invariably try to serve too many masters . Yet if the intent was ultimately to maintain a celebratory tone without ignoring either the outside world or the elephant in the room throughout this year 's awards , host Jimmy Kimmel and the show itself largely succeeded . " Others were more critical of the show . Television critic Maureen Ryan of '' Variety '' said , " All things considered , the show had a more or less low-key vibe . Normally it takes about two hours for the numbing effect to set in , but despite host Jimmy Kimmel 's best efforts , Sunday 's telecast started to feel a bit languid and low-energy far earlier . " Television critic James Poniewozik of '' The New York Times '' said , " despite the recent upheaval in Hollywood , the ceremony at large still focused mainly on celebration and glitter literally , in the case of the blinding set , which looked as if the ceremony were encased in an enormous geode . There 's also the perennial problem of bloat . The hitch , of course , is that every part of the show has its constituency . " Darren Franich of '' Entertainment Weekly '' wrote , " What fun we had at this year 's Oscars ! Long show , sure , but where to cut it ? " Writing for '' Deadline '' Greg Evans said , " Did the nearly four-hour running time contain any moments for the Oscar ages ? Probably not . " David Wiegand of the '' San Francisco Chronicle '' wrote , " Even the hope that the noise of clapping might keep the audience at home and in the theater awake , there was little of that for anything except the entrance of actors of advance age . " '' The Oregonian '' columnist Kristi Turnquist wrote , " Was it respectful ? Absolutely . Did it make for kind of a dull , earnest Oscars show ? Yeah , kind of . " Attaining 26.5 million U.S. viewers according to Nielsen ratings , the ceremony 's telecast had a 16-percent drop in viewership from last year 's ceremony and had the lowest U.S. viewership in Oscar history . On March 6 , after the final ratings were confirmed , President Donald Trump took to his Twitter account , saying , " Lowest rated Oscars in HISTORY . Problem is , we do n't have stars anymore – except your President ( just kidding , of course ) ! " . In response , Kimmel also tweeted , saying , " Thanks , lowest rated President in HISTORY . " In July 2018 , the ceremony presentation received eight nominations for the 70th Primetime Creative Arts Emmys

The effort to found the university was spearheaded by Missouri State Senator Wayman Crow , and Unitarian minister William Greenleaf Eliot , grandfather of the Nobel Prize laureate poet T. S. Eliot . Its first chancellor was Joseph Gibson Hoyt . Crow secured the university charter from the Missouri State Legislature in 1853 and handled further political maneuvering . While Eliot was in charge of raising funds for the university , he accepted the position as President of the Board of Trustees . Early on Eliot was able to solicit some support from the local business community , including John O'Fallon , one of the wealthiest people in St. Louis , even briefly considering naming the university the O'Fallon Institute . However , Eliot failed in securing a permanent endowment . In fact Wash U is unique among other American universities , in not having any prior financial endowment to begin with ; the school had no religious backing , wealthy patron , or government support .

		CONTEXT=During the 1840s , Bowser painted banners for a diverse range of clients , including the Know Nothing Party , and received a commission to paint the portrait of prominent abolitionist and real estate developer Jacob C. White . Active in that decade 's efforts to repeal the clause in Pennsylvania 's Constitution which prohibited blacks from voting , Bowser and his family also became so involved with the abolition movement that their home became a stop on the Underground Railroad . In 1858 , politics and advocacy merged with art when Bower painted the portrait of abolitionist John Brown while Brown was visiting the Bowser home . During this same period , Bowser also completed work on his painting , '' The Firebell in the Night '' . In addition , he was also active , during this phase of his life , with the Grand United Order of Odd Fellows . As Grand Master of the Order in Philadelphia , he delivered the keynote address at the Annual Moveable Committee of the G.U.O. of O.F. in Toronto , Canada on October 17 , 1859 as its members celebrated the organization 's thirteenth anniversary . According to news reports , he was " listened to throughout with much attention , and was frequently rapturously applauded " as he " defined in eloquent terms the nature of the work of Odd Fellows — especially that great and leading principle , Charity , " and " remarked upon the practical good effected by Odd Fellowship , in alleviating distress and bestowing many of the comforts of life upon the aged and infirm of the Order , as well as conferring benefactions upon the widow and orphan . " Bowser 's work on the first banner was paid for through a commission awarded by the Contraband Relief Association ( CRA ) , an organization headed by Elizabeth Keckley , the formerly enslaved woman who became Mary Todd Lincoln 's dressmaker . It was then presented by the CRA to the leaders of 1st United States Colored Infantry . With respect to the other Bowser-designed battle flags , historians at the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission note that : " The 127th and 3rd regiments marched carrying banners reading ' We will prove ourselves men ' and ' Rather Die Freemen , Than Live To Be Slaves . ' Beneath these , black soldiers protect white women representing Columbia , the symbol of the republic . The 45th 's banner , proclaiming ' One Cause , One Country , ' shows a black soldier proudly holding an American flag in front of a bust of George Washington as black troops fight in the background . The 24th 's banner shows a black soldier ascending a hill , his arms outstretched in prayer , beneath the words ' Let Soldiers in War , Be Citizens in Peace . ' " For the 22nd USCT banner , Bowser depicted a black soldier pointing " a bayonet at the chest of a Confederate who has allowed his flag to fall and who is tossing aside his sword , " beneath the words , " Sic semper tyrannis " ( " thus always to tyrants " ) , a phrase which would come to have an entirely different meaning two years later when shouted by John Wilkes Booth after his assassination of Lincoln at Ford 's Theater

		CONTEXT=Prior to and during the Civil War , Pennsylvania was a divided state . Although Pennsylvania had outlawed slavery , many conservative Pennsylvanians believed that the federal government should not interfere with the institution of slavery . One such individual was Democrat James Buchanan , the last pre-Civil War president . Buchanan 's party had generally won presidential and gubernatorial elections in Pennsylvania . However , the nascent Republican Party 's first convention took place in Philadelphia , and the 1860 elections saw the Republican Party win the state 's presidential vote and the governor 's office . After the failure of the Crittenden Compromise , the secession of the South , and the Battle of Fort Sumter , the Civil War began with Pennsylvania as a key member of the Union . Despite the Republican victory the 1860 election , Democrats remained powerful in the state , and several " copperheads " called for peace during the war . The Democrats re-took control of the state legislature in the 1862 election , but incumbent Republican Governor Andrew Curtin retained control of the governorship in 1863 . In the 1864 election , President Lincoln narrowly defeated Pennsylvania native George B. McClellan for the state 's electoral votes

		CONTEXT=Robert Browning ( 7 May 1812 – 12 December 1889 ) was an English poet and playwright whose dramatic monologues put him among the foremost Victorian poets . His poems are noted for irony , characterization , dark humour , social commentary , historical settings and challenging vocabulary and syntax . His career began well , but shrank for a time . The long poems Pauline ( 1833 ) and Paracelsus ( 1835 ) were acclaimed , but in 1840 Sordello was seen as wilfully obscure . His renown took over a decade to return , by which time he had moved from Shelleyan forms to a more personal style . In 1846 Browning married the older poet Elizabeth Barrett and went to live in Italy . By her death in 1861 he had published the collection Men and Women ( 1855 ) . His Dramatis Personae ( 1864 ) and book - length epic poem The Ring and the Book ( 1868 – 1869 ) made him a leading British poet . He continued to write prolifically , but his reputation today rests mainly on his middle period . By his death in 1889 , he was seen as a sage and philosopher - poet who had fed into Victorian social and political discourse . Societies for studying his work formed in his lifetime and survived in Britain and the United States into the 20th century .

		CONTEXT=Chartism originated in Wales in Carmarthen under the influence of Hugh Williams , a solicitor and radical reformer . Williams claimed he " got up the first radical meeting in south Wales " in the autumn of 1836 when he founded Carmarthen Working Men 's Association . This followed on from the foundation the previous year of the London Working Men 's Association by William Lovett and Henry Hetherington , Hetherington was a friend of Hugh Williams and is likely to have influenced his activities in south Wales . The People 's Charter , embodying six points , was published in May 1838 , with an address by Lovett and Hetherington . It became the focus of widespread meetings in support of its objectives throughout Britain . The People 's Charter was later published in Welsh increasing the movement 's appeal in Welsh - speaking areas . Chartism in Wales reached its climax in November 1839 with the Newport Rising and subsequent treason trial of Chartist leaders .

		CONTEXT=He arrived at the club as an incredibly shy and underdeveloped personality , a fact that was noted by teammate Trent Cotchin who said though Martin was 18 “ he seemed much younger in some of the ways he behaved . ” Indeed , he struggled initially to adjust to the expectations of professional football . In one incident in the 2010 preseason he was removed from training and verbally reprimanded by club leadership when he was deemed unfit to train after a big night out . Despite these struggles , his on-field development was such that he would still debut in the 2010 season 's opening match , a 56-point Richmond loss against at the MCG . Martin recorded the sixth most disposals of any Tiger ( 18 ) to go along with four marks , three tackles and three clearances . Two weeks later Martin was convicted by the AFL tribunal for a high hit on Sydney 's Josh Kennedy in round 3 . He did not receive a suspension for the incident however , returning to football the following week . After four matches Martin ranked fourth in the league for clearances and eighth for hard-ball gets . Media reports emerged after round 8 that the 18 year old Martin had received a significant contract offer from expansion club the Greater Western Sydney Giants . The offer , which the Herald Sun ’s Mark Robinson claimed to be worth $ 2.4 million over three seasons , would have taken effect in the new club 's first AFL season in 2012 . Martin later said he had never entertained the idea of moving to the start-up club . In round 10 he had gained attention for his on-field efforts again , this time being nominated for the 2010 AFL Rising Star award after a 21 disposal and 11 clearance match against Port Adelaide . Due to his previous tribunal conviction however , Martin was ruled ineligible for the award and thus did not officially place in the end of season award 's points tally . He drew the attention of Sydney coach Paul Roos by round 14 , prompting Roos to send veteran Brett Kirk onto Martin in a tagging role . Despite this extra attention , he still managed to record 18 disposals and a goal in the match at the MCG . After 17 rounds Martin ranked second at the club for clearances and inside 50s as well as third for disposals and contested possessions . At the same time he ranked first among that season 's Rising Star nominees in clearances , contested possessions and inside 50s . He was also fourth for average disposals and fifth for average tackles . In round 19 he was rested by the club before returning to play out the final five matches of the season . He missed just that one game in his debut season and finished the year ranked second at Richmond for clearances and inside 50s , as well as third for both contested possessions and disposals . In addition to winning the Fred Swift Medal for fourth place at the club 's best and fairest night , Martin also received six votes in the Brownlow Medal count that year , the most by any Richmond debutant since Craig Lambert in 1988 . At season 's end he reiterated his commitment to the club ( and rejection of the former GWS overtures ) by signing a two-year contract extension that would keep him at Richmond until the end of the 2013 season . The extension was reported by the Herald Sun to be in the vicinity of $ 400,000-a-year

		CONTEXT=His handling of the country 's civil war was less successful . In the north , the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam were facing off against the Indian Peace-Keeping Force - the Indian presence on the island was unpopular , and Premadasa requested India to pull out its troops . In order to force the IPKF to leave the island , he authorized a clandestine operation to supply arms to LTTE , a collusion that came to light in the report published by the Sri Lankan Presidential Commission to inquire into the 1992 assassination of Lieutenant General Denzil Kobbekaduwa . While the IPKF was recalled by New Delhi in 1990 , the government 's war with the LTTE resumed , beginning Eelam War II , which ended in a stalemate five years later . The 1990 massacre of Sri Lankan Police officers , which occurred after the policemen were asked to surrender to the LTTE in Batticaloa at Premadasa 's request , was later established to have been performed with the same weapons he had supplied them

		CONTEXT=The Imperial Japanese Navy was created in 1868 , initially the officers and sailors who manned the new navy reflected the composition of the Meiji government 's bureaucracy . Samurai who originated from the victorious coalition of south - western domains dominated the navy 's small officer corps . These domains which had led the restoration , particularly Satsuma , also dominated the numbers of recruits sent to the new Naval Academy which had opened in October 1869 . The leadership of the new navy later took steps to reform recruitment into the officer corps , and to establish the creation of a system of recruitment based on merit rather than on class or region . In 1871 , the government announced that applicants would be accepted from the public at large and that entry would be based upon competitive examinations . Eventually , in the words of Arthur Marder , the Imperial Japanese Navy turned out officers of " unquestioned professional competence , fanatical courage , and extraordinary elan " . The IJN molded among the ranks a standard of discipline , self - sacrifice , and devotion to duty that became the envy of all navies in the world . Japan 's later victories at sea , one commentator has observed , " came as much from the training and morale of the average Japanese seaman as from the effectiveness of the navy 's ships or the caliber of its guns " .

		CONTEXT=, also Disposition of the Ryūkyūs , dispositions relating to the Ryūkyūs , or Annexation of Okinawa , was the political process during the early years of the Meiji period that saw the incorporation of the former Ryūkyū Kingdom into the Empire of Japan as Okinawa Prefecture ( i.e. , one of Japan 's " home " prefectures ) and its decoupling from the Chinese tributary system . [ 10 ] These processes began with the creation of Ryūkyū Domain in 1872 and culminated in the kingdom 's annexation and final dissolution in 1879 ; immediate diplomatic fallout and consequent negotiations with Qing China , brokered by Ulysses S. Grant , effectively came to an end late the following year . [ 11 ] The term is also sometimes used more narrowly in relation to the events and changes of 1879 alone . [ 12 ] The Ryūkyū Disposition has been " alternatively characterized as aggression , annexation , national unification , or internal reform " .

This 100 centimeter long , 108 kilogram bronze cannon was discovered in a cellar in Wuwei , Gansu Province . It bears no inscription , but has been dated by historians to the late Western Xia period between 1214 and 1227 through contextual evidence . The gun contained an iron ball about nine centimeters in diameter , which is smaller than the muzzle diameter at twelve centimeters , and 0.1 kilograms of gunpowder in it when discovered , meaning that the projectile might have been another co-viative . Ben Sinvany and Dang Shoushan believe that the ball used to be much larger prior to its highly corroded state at the time of discovery . While large in size , the weapon is noticeably more primitive than later Yuan dynasty guns such as the Xanadu Gun and Heilongjiang hand cannon , and is unevenly cast . A similar weapon was discovered not far from the discovery site in 1997 , but is much smaller in size at only 1.5 kg .

Eventually , in the words of Arthur Marder , the Imperial Japanese Navy turned out officers of " unquestioned professional competence , fanatical courage , and extraordinary elan " . The IJN molded among the ranks a standard of discipline , self - sacrifice , and devotion to duty that became the envy of all navies in the world . Japan 's later victories at sea , one commentator has observed , " came as much from the training and morale of the average Japanese seaman as from the effectiveness of the navy 's ships or the caliber of its guns " .

Grant , effectively came to an end late the following year . [ 11 ] The term is also sometimes used more narrowly in relation to the events and changes of 1879 alone . [ 12 ] The Ryūkyū Disposition has been " alternatively characterized as aggression , annexation , national unification , or internal reform " .

		CONTEXT=The 43rd Guards Rifle Division was formed as an elite infantry division of the Red Army in October , 1942 , based on the 1st formation of the 201st Rifle Division , and served in that role until after the end of the Great Patriotic War . The 201st was the only division made up of Latvian nationals in the Red Army until 1944 , and the 43rd was immediately nicknamed the " Latvian Guards " division , which stuck through its existence . Formed in Northwestern Front , its initial service was in the dismal fighting around the Demyansk salient until that was evacuated by German Army Group North in February , 1943 . Through the rest of the year it fought in that Front , mostly facing the several German strongpoints in the area of Velikiye Luki . Beginning in January , 1944 the division took part in the offensive that finally drove the German forces away from Leningrad and before the summer offensive , now in 22nd Army of 2nd Baltic Front it provided a cadre to form the 130th Latvian Rifle Corps , and it served in that Corps for the duration of the war . Through 1943 and into 1944 the division was able to remain closer to full strength than many other Soviet units because it drew on a relatively large pool of Latvian refugee Communist Party members and Komsomol who had escaped ahead of the Germans in 1941 . It crossed the border back into Latvia in July and entered Riga on October 16 , winning a battle honor in the process . For the duration of the war the 43rd Guards served mostly in Leningrad Front , containing and reducing the German forces trapped in the Courland Pocket , and also engaging in restoration work in its war - battered homeland . It continued to serve in this manner until it was converted to a rifle brigade in April , 1947 .

		CONTEXT=The Importance of Being Ernie was a documentary from the Omnibus strand of programming on BBC1 and was made in 1993 following the career of the comedian Ernie Wise after the death in 1984 of his comedy partner Eric Morecambe . It charted the current work of the comedian who , since the death of his partner , had made West End appearances in The Mystery of Edwin Drood and concentrated largely on pantomime work . His autobiography , entitled Still On My Way To Hollywood , is referenced throughout the programme . Despite having the full co-operation of the subject , the programme has been criticised for focussing on him in a negative way , portraying a somewhat tragic figure and , in one section , memorably sees him reminiscing with a view of Eric Morecambe from one of their television programmes in the background . Wise is known to have been unhappy with the outcome of the broadcast programme , and it is notable for being his last major televised work prior to his death in 1999 from heart problems .

		CONTEXT=The series was devised by Carnival boss Brian Eastman and producer Stuart Doughty with input from veteran writer-producer Brian Clemens , who had previously worked on '' The Avengers '' . Clemens described '' Bugs '' as " an '' Avengers '' for the 1990s " . Other notable series writers included Colin Brake and Stephen Gallagher . Two episodes ( " Bugged Wheat " and " Hollow Man " ) , were written by Alfred Gough and Miles Millar , who went on to create the series '' Smallville '' . The theme tune was written by Gavin Greenaway . The programme was a mixture of action/adventure and science fiction , with a reliance on fast-paced plots , technical gadgetry , stunts and explosions . Much of the programme 's filming took place around the London Docklands area , which had recently been redeveloped with projects such as Canary Wharf . This was intended to give a modern , and perhaps even slightly futuristic , feel to locations of the episodes . The production was originally based at two warehouses of Blackwall Basin , on the Isle of Dogs in London . After the IRA bombing of the South Quay Plaza , the crew had to travel further to find intact buildings for exterior locations

		CONTEXT=Warshaw intended the game to be an innovative adaptation of the film , and Atari thought it would achieve high sales figures based on its connection with the film , which was extremely popular throughout the world . Negotiations to secure the rights to make the game ended in late July 1982 , giving Warshaw only 5 and a half weeks to develop the game in time for the 1982 Christmas season . The final release was critically panned , with nearly every aspect of the game facing heavy criticism . '' E.T. '' is often cited as one of the worst video games of all time and one of the biggest commercial failures in video game history . It is cited as a major contributing factor to the video game industry crash of 1983 , and has been frequently referenced and mocked in popular culture as a cautionary tale about the dangers of rushed game development and studio interference . In what was initially deemed an urban legend , reports from 1983 stated that as a result of overproduction and returns , millions of unsold cartridges were secretly buried in an Alamogordo , New Mexico landfill and covered with a layer of concrete . In April 2014 , diggers hired to investigate the claim confirmed that the Alamogordo landfill contained many '' E.T. '' cartridges , among other games . James Heller , the former Atari manager who was in charge of the burial , was also at the excavation and admitted to the Associated Press that 728,000 cartridges of various games were buried

		CONTEXT=The show received a mixed reception from media publications . On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes , the show holds an approval rating of 43 % based on 30 critics , and summarized , " The 90th Academy Awards played it safe and hit no major snags -- but by clocking in at over four hours , returning host Jimmy Kimmel and company wore out their welcome long before the surprise ending . " Hank Stuever of '' The Washington Post '' marked , " In his second year , Kimmel has shown that the telecast need n't be anything but sharp and sure , with a funny host whose bits are manageable , shareable and – best of all – forgotten . We 're not making showbiz history here ; we 're just trying to get through another Oscar night . " Chief critic David Edelstein of '' Vulture '' wrote , " This was the best , most inspiring , and most sheerly likable Academy Awards telecast I 've ever seen . ... It was also – in terms of the actual awards – among the most disappointing . " '' Vanity Fair '' s , Richard Lawson wrote , " As a host , Kimmel struck a careful , appropriately measured tone ... All told , Sunday 's ceremony did an admirable job of recognizing all the turmoil surrounding it while maintaining the silly , chintzy trappings that so many of us tune into the Oscars for . " CNN 's Brian Lowry quipped , " The Oscars are a big , unwieldy beast , which invariably try to serve too many masters . Yet if the intent was ultimately to maintain a celebratory tone without ignoring either the outside world or the elephant in the room throughout this year 's awards , host Jimmy Kimmel and the show itself largely succeeded . " Others were more critical of the show . Television critic Maureen Ryan of '' Variety '' said , " All things considered , the show had a more or less low-key vibe . Normally it takes about two hours for the numbing effect to set in , but despite host Jimmy Kimmel 's best efforts , Sunday 's telecast started to feel a bit languid and low-energy far earlier . " Television critic James Poniewozik of '' The New York Times '' said , " despite the recent upheaval in Hollywood , the ceremony at large still focused mainly on celebration and glitter literally , in the case of the blinding set , which looked as if the ceremony were encased in an enormous geode . There 's also the perennial problem of bloat . The hitch , of course , is that every part of the show has its constituency . " Darren Franich of '' Entertainment Weekly '' wrote , " What fun we had at this year 's Oscars ! Long show , sure , but where to cut it ? " Writing for '' Deadline '' Greg Evans said , " Did the nearly four-hour running time contain any moments for the Oscar ages ? Probably not . " David Wiegand of the '' San Francisco Chronicle '' wrote , " Even the hope that the noise of clapping might keep the audience at home and in the theater awake , there was little of that for anything except the entrance of actors of advance age . " '' The Oregonian '' columnist Kristi Turnquist wrote , " Was it respectful ? Absolutely . Did it make for kind of a dull , earnest Oscars show ? Yeah , kind of . " Attaining 26.5 million U.S. viewers according to Nielsen ratings , the ceremony 's telecast had a 16-percent drop in viewership from last year 's ceremony and had the lowest U.S. viewership in Oscar history . On March 6 , after the final ratings were confirmed , President Donald Trump took to his Twitter account , saying , " Lowest rated Oscars in HISTORY . Problem is , we do n't have stars anymore – except your President ( just kidding , of course ) ! " . In response , Kimmel also tweeted , saying , " Thanks , lowest rated President in HISTORY . " In July 2018 , the ceremony presentation received eight nominations for the 70th Primetime Creative Arts Emmys

Return to Zero stars a fearless Minnie Driver and the ever-affable Paul Adelstein as a couple rocked to their emotional core by the loss of their unborn child , discovered to have died in the womb shortly before the delivery date . We follow them through the wrenching procedure and recovery process with a stark realism in which husband and wife are often seen at their worst , as their once-solid relationship frays when Maggie plummets into depression and neither seem able to say or do the right things to be able to heal and move on . Though sometimes hard to watch , Zero is a compelling and beautifully acted character study that will make you care as it dramatizes a domestic tragedy with a minimum of melodrama , so rare for TV and TV-movies .

" He also wrote , " Hanish deftly zeroes in on how all the preparation and enthusiasm surrounding a new baby magnifies the enormity of the parents ’ pain here — as well as the different ways people cope , or do n’t , with such events . " Minnie Driver was nominated for the award for Best Actress in a Movie or Miniseries at the 4th Critics ' Choice Television Awards ( the award was won by Jessica Lange for '' American Horror Story : Coven '' ) and for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie

		CONTEXT=When Jackson left the role in 1999 , a recast was opposed by viewers and costars . When Jackson 's departure had previously been rumored in 1996 , Anthony Geary ( Luke ) told '' TV Guide '' that he " went to ( the '' GH '' powers ) and said , ' If we lose him , then let 's kill Lucky . ' Jonathan is too much a part of us to replace him . " Geary repeated these sentiments when Jackson confirmed leaving in 1999 . When a recast was rumored in early 2000 , Jackson stated : " When all the actors who are going to be working with the character do n't want it , it 's kind of too bad that they still do it . But I do n't really get surprised with a lot of things that they do . " The role was recast with Jacob Young , and by the time he appeared on-screen in February 2000 , the character had been off-screen for almost a year , speculated to be an attempt to ease the transition between actors due to Jackson 's popularity . Young was able to become accepted by fans ; in 2001 , Candace Havens wrote in '' The Free Lance – Star '' : " His hard work has paid off and many fans ca n't even remember there was ever someone else in the role . " Young was named Sexiest Soap Star by '' People '' magazine in 2001 . In 2002 , Young won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actor . Greg Vaughan , who took over the role from 2003 to 2009 , was the only portrayer of Lucky not to be nominated for an Emmy award . However , Vaughan did have a fan following . He was chosen by ABC Daytime and SOAPnet to participate in their 2008 Hot Guys Calendar , featuring popular male costars from ABC soap operas . At the start of 2008 , '' Zap2it '' named Vaughan No. 6 on their Top 10 Most Improved list , stating : " The gorgeous Mr. Vaughan plays angry and sexy very well . Thank goodness we 're getting to see it . " During Vaughan 's tenure , Lucky entered into a relationship with Sam McCall ( Kelly Monaco ) that was popular with fans . '' Zap2it '' named them No. 6 on their list of Top Couples of 2007 , and tied them for No. 3 in 2008 along with entangled couple Elizabeth ( Herbst ) and Jason Morgan ( Steve Burton ) , stating : " Lucky and Sam were conceived out of a revenge plot , yet quickly surprised fans and execs alike with their instant chemistry . Is the Quad in for another partner-switching shake-up in 2009 ? " When Vaughan left in 2009 , he reflected on his reception : " I am grateful as to how the fans embraced me , whether they liked me or not . It was my job to win them over and I did that in due time . " Some felt Vaughan was not a good fit for the character . In April 2008 , Allison Waldman of '' The Huffington Post '' named Jackson as one of the top ten actors to make an impact on '' General Hospital '' , stating : " He 's still the real Lucky to many people , even though two other actors have subsequently played the part . " When Jackson was hired to reprise the role in 2009 , his return was highly anticipated , but accompanied by controversy as Vaughan was let go in order to bring Jackson back . Fans had a bittersweet reaction to the switch . The network promoted Jackson 's return with the phrase , " Elizabeth 's first love is back ! " , which angered some of Vaughan 's fans . However , ratings rose the week Jackson returned , and his performance was well received . Jackson was nominated for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series in 2010 , only having been with the show for three months of 2009 . Jackson 's return changed the dynamic of the Elizabeth and Nikolas affair storyline , which had a negative reception from fans who thought it did not align with the history between Herbst and Jackson . The scenes in early 2010 where Lucky confronts Elizabeth and Nikolas about their affair received praise . That April , '' We Love Soaps '' named Jackson No. 26 of the top 50 Greatest Soap Actors , Damon L. Jacobs commenting : " From that first scene as Lucky in the Canadian diner , to his recent scenes of betrayal railing against Elizabeth and Nikolas , Jonathan adds a profound depth and spiritual gravity to the scripted words that is far beyond his years . His piercing bloodshot eyes shoot daggers far more deadly than Sonny 's guns , and his smile encapsulates all that was celebrated about Luke and Laura 's connection . " Michael Logan of '' TV Guide '' named Jackson the best actor of 2010 , referencing the affair confrontation when stating : Jackson submitted those scenes for the 38th Daytime Emmy Awards , where he won his fourth Daytime Emmy Award and first win as Outstanding Supporting Actor . The scenes were compared to classics such as Judith Light 's performance of Karen Wolek 's courtroom confession scene on '' One Life to Live '' and Kim Zimmer ’s performance of Reva Shayne 's fountain scene on '' Guiding Light '' . Jackson 's on-screen chemistry with Erin Chambers ( Siobhan ) also had a positive reception at the end of 2010 . However the following year they were rated the No. 6 Worst Soap Opera Couple of 2011 by '' Zap2it '' , who stated : " We spent 2011 desperately clinging to those few early memories , as Siobhan transformed from an appealing character into a shrill , insecure harpy ( ... ) Try as Jackson and Chambers might , the actors were unable to salvage an ounce of their prior appeal as a couple . " On the other hand , the entertainment website named Jackson No. 3 of the Top 10 Male Entertainers that year . Jackson had a range of emotional work in 2011 that received acclaim , including the scenes following the death of Lucky 's son Jake , a storyline met by criticism by some fans . In 2012 , Jackson won his fifth Daytime Emmy Award for his scenes where Lucky tells Luke that Luke was the driver that hit Jake and confronts him about his drinking . When Jackson was nominated , '' On-Air On-Soaps '' stated :

Permanent repair and earthquake strengthening was estimated to cost over NZ$ 2m . Christchurch City Council initially considered placing a temporary steel structure around the arch , but , at NZ$ 430,000 , have since dismissed this idea as being too expensive . The Returned Services ' Association expressed dismay at the decision to not go ahead with the temporary work , citing fears of losing the heritage structure altogether in another strong aftershock , in just the same way as happened to the Lyttelton Timeball Station in the June aftershock . The Bridge of Remembrance repairs earthquake strengthening started in May 2013 , with hopes of repairs being partially completed to commemorate the 100th anniversary of World War I in August 2014 and being fully completed in time to commemorate Anzac Day 2015 . Those timelines were not met and whilst structural repairs were completed by December 2015 at a cost of NZ$ 6.7 m , the Bridge of Remembrance re-opened to the public and rededicated on Anzac Day , Monday 25 April 2016

		GOLD_MENTION=first earthquake in 2010
		CONTEXT=The owner of the Westende building , on the corner of Manchester and Worcester Street and some away from Radio Network House , threatened to seek a court injunction against the implosion . He raised concerns about potential seismic activity , possible damage to his new building , and noxious contaminants transferred by dust . The original Westende building had been destroyed in the first earthquake in 2010 and was one of the very few new buildings in the centre of Christchurch to have been rebuilt already . The concerns were dismissed by the demolition contractors and the threatened court action did not eventuate . Soon after the announcement was made that the implosion had been approved , it was reported that the demolition contractors considered putting the right to push the button for the implosion up for auction , with the proceeds going to charity . " I 've seen them go for $ 6,000 " is how one of the company representatives was quoted , but the issue of liability needed to be worked through . The auction was set up on the internet auction website Trade Me and went live on Tuesday , 24 July , at 11 am . It was set up with a $ 1 reserve ( meaning that theoretically , the right to push the button could have been sold for just $ 1 ) . The auction was hugely popular and within one hour , bidding had reached $ 6,000 . Bidding reached $ 30,000 , but some bids were considered illegitimate and Trade Me staff removed them , and in other cases , bidders themselves requested to be removed

		CONTEXT=Highway 3 has existed in Alberta on generally the same alignment since the 1910s , with only relatively minor changes made to a rough road called the Red Trail that had been carved from Medicine Hat to Crowsnest Pass . Difficult terrain on the south shore of Crowsnest Lake was a major obstacle in connecting the road to the British Columbia border . On April 29 , 1903 , a major rockslide buried the town of Frank and killed dozens , blocking the existing Red Trail . Work immediately began to clear the railway of debris , but a new trail north of the slide was created , connecting Frank and Bellevue . By 1906 , a road had been carved through the rock to the south of the railway , replacing the temporary trail . A formal opening of the highway was held on October 8 , 1917 in Blairmore . Officials had aimed for the ceremony to be held in September , but final work on the road had been delayed by the Canadian Pacific Railway who were unhappy with the location at which the highway crossed the railroad , causing the originally surveyed route to be altered . Minister of Public Works Charles Stewart had travelled from Edmonton for the event and stated that the highway was " the only natural route " for a trans-Canada highway , and would be in better condition if not for the difficult economic times . Canada was embroiled in World War I which ended in 1918 , and gravelling of the highway began in the following years

The Railway suffered millions of dollars of damage which included ten passenger carriages , four accommodation carriages , a nearly completed shower block and meal room destroyed and a spare parts centre and the machine shop and workshop badly damaged . Electrical equipment to operate signals was totally destroyed as was the repeater tower for the safety radio communication system and the internal telephone lines and exchange . One thousand new railway sleepers were also lost as was the caretaker 's converted accommodation carriage . The caretaker was " lucky to escape with her life " according to the Zig Zag 's then CEO Michael Forbes . Much of the damage was suffered by original railway equipment from the 1920s . At that time it was estimated that the railway would take a full year to recover from the State Mine Fire . Heavy rain then caused subsequent damage to an embankment near the western end of the Clarence tunnel , the platform area at Top Points , and to the run around loop track at Bottom Points . As at September 2017 restoration of vehicles and infrastructure is still being undertaken and hopes are for recommencement of services as soon as safe and practical . Due to the complexity of repairs and reinstatement infrastructure , the re-opening is currently hoped for late 2019 if all proceeds smoothly . The railway ’s website has updates on the redevelopment

		CONTEXT=The flood was preceded by rains from March 9 that did not stop until March 22 , 1936 . The storms brought warmer 50 °F ( 10 °C ) weather that was a cause of one stage of flooding and the continuous rains a second cause of flooding . The natural run-off of 1 to 3 inches ( 2.5 to 7.5 cm ) was far surpassed by the deluge of from 10 to 30 inches ( 25 to 75 cm ) of water in the region . The flood came before pending flood control legislation was enacted or any significant flood control measures implemented . The narrowness of the valleys and encroachment of buildings on the river banks contributed to record flooding . By the time nightfall came one-third of the city was under of water and by the time flooding was over twenty-five people lost their lives . The damages , estimated at $ 43 million , made it the worst flood since the flood of 1889 and the event is chronicled at the Johnstown Flood Museum After the flood , sweeping nationwide flood control laws were enacted and from 1938 to 1943 Johnstown saw many projects completed . These measures gave the people the feeling that the area was now " flood free " , and it was touted as such until the flood of 1977

		CONTEXT=In 1937 , Wang led his unit in the Battle of Shanghai . His regiment commander was Zhang Lingfu , whom he had just bailed out of prison . In late November , the Chinese army lost the battle for Shanghai and the Japanese Central China Area Army under General Iwane Matsui advanced toward Nanjing . During the Battle of Nanjing , Wang 's 51st division suffered heavy casualties and his superior General Tang Shengzhi fled the city without even notifying him and the other senior commanders . Wang barely escaped the city and only 3,000 troops under his command managed to breakout from the Japanese onslaught . In 1938 he took part in the Battle of Lanfeng to fight against the Japanese 14th Division ( Imperial Japanese Army ) led by General Kenji Doihara , one of the masterminds of the Manchurian Incident . The failure to hold off the Japanese attacks also led the nationalist government open dykes on the Yellow River , causing the 1938 Yellow River flood . During the Battle of Wanjialing , Wang 's unit fought against the Japanese attempts to break out from the Chinese encirclement , in which the 106th Division ( Imperial Japanese Army ) under Lieutenant General Junrokurō Matsuura was almost wiped out . In 1939 , Wang led his unit to participate in the Battle of Nanchang , but Chinese forces failed to hold the city . Wang , however , distinguished himself during the Battle of Changsha and was promoted to the command of the 74th corps . Under his command , the 74th corps became one of the elite units of the Chinese government forces and fought in almost every engagement in the remaining period of the War . By the war 's end , General Wang was promoted to command the 4th area army and became a member of the KMT central committee

		CONTEXT=The Ferris - Haggerty Mine Site was one of the richest components of the Grand Encampment Mining District in Carbon County , Wyoming . The site was first exploited by Ed Haggerty , a prospector from Whitehaven , England , in 1897 when he established the Rudefeha Mine that would later be known as the Ferris - Haggerty Mine on a rich deposit of copper ore . Haggerty was backed by George Ferris and other investors , of whom all but Ferris dropped out . The partners sold an interest to Willis George Emerson , who raised investment funding for improvements to the mine . These facilities included an engineering feat of its day by developing a aerial tramway to carry high grade copper mined at the Ferris - Haggerty Mine ( FHM ) over the Continental Divide to the smelter in Encampment . The tramway was longest aerial tramway the world had ever seen . The mine was eventually acquired by the North American Copper Company for 123 billion . By 1904 the mine had produced $ 1.4 million in copper ore , and was sold to the Penn - Wyoming Copper Company . However , even with copper prices peaking in 1907 , the company had difficulty making a profit from the remote mine site . The company was over-capitalized and under - insured and was suffered devastating fires at the mine site in March 1906 and May 1907 which halted production . Business disputes and a fall in copper prices prevented re-opening of the mine even after it was rebuilt . Machinery was salvaged after a foreclosure in 1913 . A total of 23 million pounds of copper ore was extracted from the mine during its life .

		CONTEXT=The Northern New Brunswick and Seaboard Railway can lay claim to be the railway company with the fewest miles of standard gauge track in history . The province empowered it in 1904 to lay track between Nepisiguit Junction and Grand Falls , a distance of 16 miles , to serve the Drummond Iron Mines , which were discovered in 1897 by William Hussey . By 1903 the Austin Brook Iron Mine was formed , and operated under the name Drummond until 1913 , when it went bust . It was in receivership for some short time until the Dominion Steel and Coal Company purchased the right to operate the mine from Canadian Iron Industries , who held the lease . Between 1920 and 1926 , the construction of the Grand Falls hydroelectricity dam and plant required twice - daily return trips with a steam locomotive . Thereafter , a gasoline - powered jitney , trolly or automobile with steel wheels would serve , until in the early 1950s the Brunswick Mine attracted attention once again to the area . In 1955 a highway was pushed through to the mine site , and two years later the rails were sold for scrap .

		GOLD_MENTION=major rockslide
		CONTEXT=Highway 3 has existed in Alberta on generally the same alignment since the 1910s , with only relatively minor changes made to a rough road called the Red Trail that had been carved from Medicine Hat to Crowsnest Pass . Difficult terrain on the south shore of Crowsnest Lake was a major obstacle in connecting the road to the British Columbia border . On April 29 , 1903 , a major rockslide buried the town of Frank and killed dozens , blocking the existing Red Trail . Work immediately began to clear the railway of debris , but a new trail north of the slide was created , connecting Frank and Bellevue . By 1906 , a road had been carved through the rock to the south of the railway , replacing the temporary trail . A formal opening of the highway was held on October 8 , 1917 in Blairmore . Officials had aimed for the ceremony to be held in September , but final work on the road had been delayed by the Canadian Pacific Railway who were unhappy with the location at which the highway crossed the railroad , causing the originally surveyed route to be altered . Minister of Public Works Charles Stewart had travelled from Edmonton for the event and stated that the highway was " the only natural route " for a trans-Canada highway , and would be in better condition if not for the difficult economic times . Canada was embroiled in World War I which ended in 1918 , and gravelling of the highway began in the following years

		CONTEXT=An unnamed official claimed there was good reason to believe Awlaki " has been involved in very serious terrorist activities since leaving the US in 2002 , including plotting attacks against America and our allies . " US President Barack Obama approved the targeted killing of al-Awlaki by April 2010 , making al-Awlaki the first US citizen ever placed on the CIA target list . That required the consent of the US National Security Council , and officials argued that the attack was appropriate because the individual posed an imminent danger to national security . In May 2010 , Faisal Shahzad , who pleaded guilty to the 2010 Times Square car bombing attempt , told interrogators he was " inspired by " al-Awlaki , and sources said Shahzad had made contact with al-Awlaki over the Internet . Representative Jane Harman called him " terrorist number one " , and '' Investor 's Business Daily '' called him " the world 's most dangerous man " . In July 2010 , the US Treasury Department added him to its list of Specially Designated Global Terrorists , and the UN added him to its list of individuals associated with al-Qaeda . In August 2010 , al-Awlaki 's father initiated a lawsuit against the US government with the American Civil Liberties Union , challenging its order to kill al-Awlaki . In October 2010 , US and UK officials linked al-Awlaki to the 2010 cargo plane bomb plot . In September 2011 , al-Awlaki was killed in a targeted killing drone attack in Yemen .

According to a November 11 press release , after preliminary examination of Hasan 's computers and internet activity , they had found no information to indicate he had any co-conspirators or was part of a broader terrorist plot " at this point " . Although this was what they stressed were the " early stages " of the review , no contrary conclusions had been reached even after reports that the US government believed that Awlaki had been the target of airstrikes in Yemen , and that on December 26 , 2009 , investigators said that the suspect of the Northwest Airlines Flight 253 bombing admitted that he had attended camps in Yemen where al-Qaeda members including Anwar al-Awlaki had instructed him , blessed the attack , and provided the bomb

		GOLD_MENTION=Sundance last January
		CONTEXT=On January 27 , 2011 the festival sent 9 filmmakers to 9 cities across the US to screen and discuss their films . The cities and films included : Bob Tourtellotte of Reuters wrote " Sundance 2011 has proven to be exceptionally strong , audiences and filmmakers seem to agree . " Tourtellotte reported that Robert Redford said that three years ago the Sundance Institute " set out to get back to its roots of supporting alternative voices in cinema and he felt like this year that strategy paid off . " Redford said " This year , what has excited me , is I think the quality is increasing in diversity and is increasing in depth . " The AP reported that Redford said it 's " always a relief " when the festival ends because " it 's really exhausting . " Kenneth Turan , film critic for the '' Los Angeles Times '' , wrote " though the festival has gotten ever bigger — and ( thankfully ) more efficient in moving its close to 50,000 attendees in and out of its far-flung theaters — it still retains the scrappy , antic spirit that has animated it from the start . " Turan wrote " One of the paradoxes of Sundance is that the quirkiness and charm around the edges of the festival are not always fully appreciated because so much of the media focus is on the premieres section and the U.S. dramatic competition " which he said " are , frankly , often the weakest parts of the festival . " Turan said " Sundance 's insistence on giving equal weight to documentaries and dramas has made it into as important a nonfiction showcase as any festival in the world ; witness the fact that four out of the five Oscar-nominated docs this year debuted at Sundance last January . " He also wrote that the foreign language film competition " is a strength at Sundance , and yet that field is given even less popular attention than the documentaries . " Peter Knegt wrote that this year 's festival " probably wo n't replicate last year 's Oscar record . " He said " Despite a huge surge in sales , this year 's Sundance slate looks like it might be the least Oscar-friendly in some time . " He noted that the U.S. Dramatic Grand Jury Prize winners have been nominated for Best Picture for two years ( referring to '' Precious '' and '' Winter 's Bone '' ) . Knegt speculated on films that might be nominated for the Oscars . Films he deemed " most likely to succeed " at being nominated included : '' Like Crazy '' for Best Picture , Michael Shannon of '' Take Shelter '' for Best Actor , Elizabeth Olsen of '' Martha Marcy May Marlene '' for Best Actress , Felicity Jones of '' Like Crazy '' for Best Actress , Jessica Chastain of '' Take Shelter '' for Best Supporting Actress , '' Project Nim '' for Best Documentary Feature , '' Page One '' for Best Documentary Feature , and '' The Interrupters '' for Best Documentary Feature . He wrote " It 's reasonable to feel assured that at least one of Sundance 's docs will end up an Oscar nominee , if not two , three or four . " Jada Yuan of '' New York '' magazine wrote " perhaps the biggest highlight of the festival is just how ripe it 's been for acquisitions , with nearly 30 films getting picked up , the most at any Sundance ever .

He and his co-writer , Hervé Guibert , worked for six years on the scenario , which tells of a love affair between an older man involved in prostitution and a teenage boy , a dark view in the context of HIV/AIDS . His 1994 film was '' La Reine Margot '' , based on the 1845 historical novel of the same name by Alexandre Dumas .

Set in the 16th-century , depicting the conflict between Catholics and Protestants in France , it shows battles and the St Bartholomew 's day massacre .

The film was Chéreau 's longest , most expensive production , and his greatest financial success . " I t was erotic and violent , and offers poured in from Hollywood , " but , he said , " I was always being offered films based in the Renaissance and involving a massacre .

		GOLD_MENTION=Sundance last January
		CONTEXT=On January 27 , 2011 the festival sent 9 filmmakers to 9 cities across the US to screen and discuss their films . The cities and films included : Bob Tourtellotte of Reuters wrote " Sundance 2011 has proven to be exceptionally strong , audiences and filmmakers seem to agree . " Tourtellotte reported that Robert Redford said that three years ago the Sundance Institute " set out to get back to its roots of supporting alternative voices in cinema and he felt like this year that strategy paid off . " Redford said " This year , what has excited me , is I think the quality is increasing in diversity and is increasing in depth . " The AP reported that Redford said it 's " always a relief " when the festival ends because " it 's really exhausting . " Kenneth Turan , film critic for the '' Los Angeles Times '' , wrote " though the festival has gotten ever bigger — and ( thankfully ) more efficient in moving its close to 50,000 attendees in and out of its far-flung theaters — it still retains the scrappy , antic spirit that has animated it from the start . " Turan wrote " One of the paradoxes of Sundance is that the quirkiness and charm around the edges of the festival are not always fully appreciated because so much of the media focus is on the premieres section and the U.S. dramatic competition " which he said " are , frankly , often the weakest parts of the festival . " Turan said " Sundance 's insistence on giving equal weight to documentaries and dramas has made it into as important a nonfiction showcase as any festival in the world ; witness the fact that four out of the five Oscar-nominated docs this year debuted at Sundance last January . " He also wrote that the foreign language film competition " is a strength at Sundance , and yet that field is given even less popular attention than the documentaries . " Peter Knegt wrote that this year 's festival " probably wo n't replicate last year 's Oscar record . " He said " Despite a huge surge in sales , this year 's Sundance slate looks like it might be the least Oscar-friendly in some time . " He noted that the U.S. Dramatic Grand Jury Prize winners have been nominated for Best Picture for two years ( referring to '' Precious '' and '' Winter 's Bone '' ) . Knegt speculated on films that might be nominated for the Oscars . Films he deemed " most likely to succeed " at being nominated included : '' Like Crazy '' for Best Picture , Michael Shannon of '' Take Shelter '' for Best Actor , Elizabeth Olsen of '' Martha Marcy May Marlene '' for Best Actress , Felicity Jones of '' Like Crazy '' for Best Actress , Jessica Chastain of '' Take Shelter '' for Best Supporting Actress , '' Project Nim '' for Best Documentary Feature , '' Page One '' for Best Documentary Feature , and '' The Interrupters '' for Best Documentary Feature . He wrote " It 's reasonable to feel assured that at least one of Sundance 's docs will end up an Oscar nominee , if not two , three or four . " Jada Yuan of '' New York '' magazine wrote " perhaps the biggest highlight of the festival is just how ripe it 's been for acquisitions , with nearly 30 films getting picked up , the most at any Sundance ever .
