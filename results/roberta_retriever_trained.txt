Hugh Smith , who owned Cedar Falls Ice and Fuel Company , made plans for the present structure . It was completed in November 1921 by the Cedar Falls Construction Company . The first ice harvest began on January 10 , 1922 . The building served as an ice house from 1922 until Smith lost his business in 1934 . Cedar Falls Trust and Savings Bank took over the building . It was used as a livestock barn and later was flooded for ice skating . In 1938 the city of Cedar Falls purchased the building and leased it to the Cedar Falls Boat Club .

		Hickel 's centrist voice inside the Nixon Administration eventually led to confrontations with the President . In 1970 following the shooting of college students at Kent State University by the Ohio National Guard , Hickel wrote a letter critical of Nixon 's Vietnam War policy and urging him to give more respect to the views of young people critical of the war , writing in part , " I believe this administration finds itself today embracing a philosophy which appears to lack appropriate concern for the attitude of a great mass of Americans – our young people . " That dissent garnered worldwide media attention , and on November 25 , 1970 , Hickel was fired over the letter . Days before he lost the office , Hickel had told CBS ' '' 60 Minutes '' that he would not quit under pressure and that he would go away only " with an arrow in my heart , not a bullet in my back .

		The Rivervale Inverted Siphons , also known as the Rivervale Tunnel , are a historic flood control project in rural Poinsett County , Arkansas . It is essentially a very large concrete culvert , which channels the water flow of Ditch Number 4 under the Right Hand Chute Little River , into which it would normally drain . It is located just off Arkansas Highway 135 in northeastern Poinsett County , near its junctions with County Roads 87 and 112 . Built in 1924 – 26 , the purpose of the culvert was to reduce the amount of water carried by the Right Hand Chute during major flooding events by diverting the volume of Ditch Number 4 further downstream . As part of a robust series of flood control works , it helped stabilize flood management in the area so that further economic development could take place .

		In 1977 the Board of Governors of the World Bank approved Bura Irrigation and Settlement Project ( BISP ) in Kenya . The project area is situated just South of the Equator in the Lower Tana Basin . It lies on the west bank of the Tana River and falls within the administrative area of Tana River County . The project was an ambitious attempt of the government of Kenya , the World Bank and a few other donors to develop a remote area , create employment for thousands of people with a reasonable income and earn foreign exchange . Bura project would develop about 6,700 net irrigated ha over a 5 1/2 year period and settle on smallholdings about 5,150 landless poor families selected from all parts of Kenya . Physical and social infrastructure would be provided to support the settler and satellite population , expected to reach a total of 65,000 persons by 1985 . The total cost of the project was estimated at 92 million dollars in 1977 prices . Actual construction started in 1978 . During implementation the costs exploded from $ 17,500 / = per family to $ 55,000 / = , a new record for the World Bank . The largest cost increase was for the irrigation network ( 615 % ) . The donors were not willing and the government was not able to raise the additional funds and subsequently the size of the project was scaled down from 6,700 ha to 3,900 and later to 2,500 ha , although the irrigation structures were completed for 6,700 ha . In this period 2,100 landless households from all over Kenya were settled in the scheme . They were allocated two plots of 0.625 ha and a garden of 0.05 ha . Each year they were to grow 1.25 ha cotton and 0.625 maize intercropped with cowpeas . Soon it was evident that the project would fail to achieve its objectives . Job creation was only 40 % of the target , the economic rate of return was negative and the annual operating and maintenance costs exceeded the benefits . Even with net farm incomes of about 40 % of the appraisal estimates in real terms , annual government subsidies amounted to about 1,000 dollars per settler . The project had an unreliable water supply and many buildings had foundation problems . After cotton crop failures due to pests in 1990 the project came virtually to a standstill as the management lacked the funds to finance cotton and maize crops . Most settlers deserted and the only the ones with nowhere to go remained in the scheme , living on famine relief and odd jobs . In the period 1993 - 2005 a number of times the government tried to revive a number of timesthe project , but all in vain . After 2005 , rehabilitation and crop growing started in phases and since 2009 - 10 the tenants have been growing crops , although the cropping pattern comed down to no more than 50 % of the projected crop intensity and the settlers have low incomes , if any . This is partly caused by the fact that the original cash crop , cotton , is no longer a profitable crop .

		The Middle Fork Project ( detailed in the next section ) was constructed by the Placer County Water Agency for water supply and hydropower generation , after receiving approval from the Federal Power Commission in 1963 . L.L. Anderson ( French Meadows ) Dam , completed in December 1964 , was the first major structure to be built . Hell Hole Dam on the Rubicon River was still under construction at that time when massive flooding struck northern California . More than of rain fell within five days . On December 23 the incomplete dam was overtopped and destroyed , and a wall of water swept down the Rubicon , lower Middle Fork , and lower North Fork canyons , triggering landslides , uprooting trees , and obliterating any buildings and bridges along its path . However , since there were no permanent residences in the canyon , there was no loss of human life , and the floodwaters were contained by Folsom Lake , sparing the city of Sacramento from damage . The flood surge of may have exceeded in magnitude any natural flood since the Pleistocene . The dam was rebuilt and completed in 1966

They also harbor Husam Badran , former leader of Hamas 's military wing in the northern West Bank . Husam Badran , current media spokesman for Hamas , was the instigator of several of the deadliest suicide bombings of the second intifada , including the Dolphinarium discotheque bombing in Tel Aviv , which killed 21 people . Turkey has also been criticized for housing terrorists including Saleh al-Arouri , the senior Hamas officer , known for his ability to mastermind attacks from abroad .

" Christopher Orlet of '' The American Spectator '' did not agree with Ahmed 's " identity crisis " . He said , " That 's not an identity crisis , Lord Ahmed , that 's religious psychopathy . That 's a bloodthirstiness that makes Dracula look like a teetotaler . " Ahmed did acknowledge , " the community leaders and religious leaders , who have kept very close contacts with South Asia and the Middle East rather than keeping a good contact with the British society where we live . " On 30 November 2006 , the '' New Statesman '' reported a claim by fellow Muslim and Labour parliamentarian Shahid Malik that Ahmed had campaigned against him during the Dewsbury election in 2005 . He alleged that Ahmed instead backed Sayeeda Warsi , vice-chair of the Conservative Party , the daughter of a personal friend . According to the New Statesman 's report , Warsi " welcomed Lord Ahmed 's support " .

		Following the 25th of January 2011 Revolution , on the 4th & 5 March 2011 , several SSI buildings were raided across Egypt by protesters . Protesters state they raided in the buildings to secure documents they believed to show various crimes committed by the SSI against the people of Egypt during Mubarak 's rule . On the night of 5 March in Cairo , " the sight of a dump truck emerging from the Cairo compound laden with shredded paper sent protesters into a fury , creating the momentum that drove the crowd past the army soldiers outside and into the hastily abandoned main building . " Most notably at the Nasr City HQ in Cairo were many acquired documents which seemed to prove mass surveillance of citizens as well as torturing tools and secret cells . Protesters broke into the building in Alexandria on March 4 , after clashing with security forces , and on March 5 others entered the headquarters in the central city of Assiut . In Cairo , another building breached was in 6th of October City , where " some of the most incriminating documents have already been destroyed . " McClatchy Newspapers reported that , when there was much uncertainty about the validity of documents which emerged , " p erhaps the most controversial document to ricochet around Internet message boards was one that purport ed to lay out State Security 's involvement in the deadly church bombing on New Year 's Day in the port city of Alexandria . ... The legitimacy of the document has n't been determined , but its distribution touched off protests Sunday in Cairo by hundreds of Coptic Christians . " Other documents uncovered included names of judges involved in fixing elections and those of a small number of Egyptians who were informants . The publishing of these names posed a moral dilemma for some of the protesters , balancing the danger the informants would be put under against anger at having been spied on

		In April , a couple of months prior to Morsi 's inauguration , the Administrative Court suspended a constituent assembly previously appointed in March without giving any clear reasons for this decision and which the Brotherhood claimed was politically motivated . In mid-June however , another 100-member assembly was officially selected a week after a deal was reached between the ruling military council and representatives of 22 parties . Tensions later resumed after a court ruled that the entire Islamist-dominated parliament was illegally elected and ordered the body to dissolve , which angered the Brotherhood and Mohamed Beltagy called it a " full-fledged coup " . On 18 June , the SCAF issued a supplementary constitutional declaration that limits the to-be president 's power over the military and gives it complete control over all army decisions . However , those controversial moves never changed the status of the constituent assembly as it was elected by the Shura Council not by parliament . Also , the same day the military delivered its statement , Hossam El-Gheriany was elected as chairman of the assembly . Military chief Mohamed Hussein Tantawi was forced to retire by Morsi on 12 August , a month and a half after the latter was elected and a week after a militant attack in Sinai that had the military preoccupied , leaving the constituent assembly 's drafting process unchallenged

		The show received a mixed reception from media publications . On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes , the show holds an approval rating of 43 % based on 30 critics , and summarized , " The 90th Academy Awards played it safe and hit no major snags -- but by clocking in at over four hours , returning host Jimmy Kimmel and company wore out their welcome long before the surprise ending . " Hank Stuever of '' The Washington Post '' marked , " In his second year , Kimmel has shown that the telecast need n't be anything but sharp and sure , with a funny host whose bits are manageable , shareable and – best of all – forgotten . We 're not making showbiz history here ; we 're just trying to get through another Oscar night . " Chief critic David Edelstein of '' Vulture '' wrote , " This was the best , most inspiring , and most sheerly likable Academy Awards telecast I 've ever seen . ... It was also – in terms of the actual awards – among the most disappointing . " '' Vanity Fair '' s , Richard Lawson wrote , " As a host , Kimmel struck a careful , appropriately measured tone ... All told , Sunday 's ceremony did an admirable job of recognizing all the turmoil surrounding it while maintaining the silly , chintzy trappings that so many of us tune into the Oscars for . " CNN 's Brian Lowry quipped , " The Oscars are a big , unwieldy beast , which invariably try to serve too many masters . Yet if the intent was ultimately to maintain a celebratory tone without ignoring either the outside world or the elephant in the room throughout this year 's awards , host Jimmy Kimmel and the show itself largely succeeded . " Others were more critical of the show . Television critic Maureen Ryan of '' Variety '' said , " All things considered , the show had a more or less low-key vibe . Normally it takes about two hours for the numbing effect to set in , but despite host Jimmy Kimmel 's best efforts , Sunday 's telecast started to feel a bit languid and low-energy far earlier . " Television critic James Poniewozik of '' The New York Times '' said , " despite the recent upheaval in Hollywood , the ceremony at large still focused mainly on celebration and glitter literally , in the case of the blinding set , which looked as if the ceremony were encased in an enormous geode . There 's also the perennial problem of bloat . The hitch , of course , is that every part of the show has its constituency . " Darren Franich of '' Entertainment Weekly '' wrote , " What fun we had at this year 's Oscars ! Long show , sure , but where to cut it ? " Writing for '' Deadline '' Greg Evans said , " Did the nearly four-hour running time contain any moments for the Oscar ages ? Probably not . " David Wiegand of the '' San Francisco Chronicle '' wrote , " Even the hope that the noise of clapping might keep the audience at home and in the theater awake , there was little of that for anything except the entrance of actors of advance age . " '' The Oregonian '' columnist Kristi Turnquist wrote , " Was it respectful ? Absolutely . Did it make for kind of a dull , earnest Oscars show ? Yeah , kind of . " Attaining 26.5 million U.S. viewers according to Nielsen ratings , the ceremony 's telecast had a 16-percent drop in viewership from last year 's ceremony and had the lowest U.S. viewership in Oscar history . On March 6 , after the final ratings were confirmed , President Donald Trump took to his Twitter account , saying , " Lowest rated Oscars in HISTORY . Problem is , we do n't have stars anymore – except your President ( just kidding , of course ) ! " . In response , Kimmel also tweeted , saying , " Thanks , lowest rated President in HISTORY . " In July 2018 , the ceremony presentation received eight nominations for the 70th Primetime Creative Arts Emmys

		Described as both a " musical montage " and the " magical set piece " of '' Beauty and the Beast '' , " Be Our Guest " is " a big production number featuring dancing cutlery . " Analyzing the scene 's complex , elaborate choreography , film critics have observed the profound influence that American filmmaker and choreographer Busby Berkeley has had on " Be Our Guest " , deeming its lively " Busby Berkeley-style choreography " both " joyous and charming " while commenting , " Without the confines of camera range , there are virtually no limits to how spectacular an animated Berkeley scene can be ... most notably ... ' Be Our Guest ' . " David Kronke of Amazon.com hailed the song itself as " an inspired Busby Berkeley homage . " Similarly , the Dance Films Association wrote , " the ' Be Our Guest ' number features practically all of the techniques employed by Berkeley in his musical comedies , " while '' The New York Times '' called " Be Our Guest " a " Busby Berkeley-style number in which Belle is serenaded by furniture and dishes . " Film critic Roger Ebert joked that the " Be Our Guest " choreography resembles " Busby Berkeley running amok . " Additionally , Jerry Griswold , author of '' The Meanings of " Beauty and the Beast " : A Handbook '' , observed several similarities between " Be Our Guest " and a scene from Maurice Sendak and Carole King 's musical '' Really Rosie '' . Significantly , '' Beauty and the Beast '' was one of Disney 's earliest feature-length animated films to fully employ computer-generated imagery and technology , utilizing it to a significant extent , as depicted throughout its signature musical numbers " Be Our Guest " and " Beauty and the Beast . " Significantly , " Be Our Guest " " marks the debut of the Pixar Image Computer ' '' '' ' system that is featured in the ballroom dance sequence and ' Be Our Guest ' . " Due to its elaborateness , the sequence has been noted for " tak ing full advantage of the advantages of animation . " " Be Our Guest " is , according to the song 's official sheet music , a Broadway musical-inspired song . Another inspiration for the song is a minor theme from Mahler 's Third Symphony , occurring in both the first and third movements , which the Disney song copied nearly note for note as the main theme . An energetic , " turbo-charged Broadway chorus number , " " Be Our Guest " was written in common time at a " free " tempo of 50 beats per minute , spanning a length of three minutes and forty-four seconds . In " Be Our Guest , " Orbach 's " low " tenor or baritone vocal range spans roughly three octaves , from the low note of F3 to the high note of D ♭ 6 . Described as a " scintillating , " " jolly , " " lavish and bouncy " song , " Be Our Guest " is , according to '' TV Guide '' , a " boisterous " number , comparing it to songs from the Broadway musicals '' Hello , Dolly ! '' and '' Mame '' . Musically , the song , according to Film.com , has a total of four key changes and modulations , beginning slowly and " gradually build ing ... to a thunderous , bring-the-house-down climax . " Additionally described as " a spark of Gallic vaudeville that lights a flame to both entertainers Maurice Chevalier and Yves Montand , " " Be Our Guest " depicts both " fun " and " humour . " Extending a warm , energetic invitation towards Belle , the first verse of the song is preceded by a spoken introduction . It reads , at first in French , " '' Ma chere Mademoiselle '' , it is with deepest pride and greatest pleasure that we welcome you tonight . And now we invite you to relax , let us pull up a chair as the dining room proudly presents : your dinner , " immediately succeeded by the sung lyrics " '' Be our guest , be our guest , put our service to the test , '' " continuing with " '' Go on , unfold your menu / take a glance and then you 'll / be our guest / oui , our guest / be our guest '' . " A nostalgic Lumiere muses about being human , pining for the " good old days when we were useful . " Furthermore , Lumiere voices his need to serve , singing , " Life is so unnerving/For a servant who 's not serving . " " Be Our Guest " has been universally lauded , receiving widespread critical acclaim and garnering nearly unanimously positive reviews from both film and music critics . Hailing it as a " crowd-pleasing production number , " '' TV Guide '' drew similarities between " Be Our Guest " and songs from the Broadway musicals '' Hello , Dolly ! '' and '' Mame '' . '' The Globe and Mail '' 's Jennie Punter called the song " show-stopping . " Similarly , Drew Taylor of Indiewire echoed Punter 's statement , writing , " when the enchanted wait staff dazzle the captive Belle , assuring her that she 's not a prisoner she 's a guest of the castle , " the result is ultimately " show-stopping . " Writing for the '' Austin Chronicle '' , Kathleen Maher , who generally panned the film 's songs and musical numbers , liked " Be Our Guest " , describing it as '' Beauty and the Beast '' 's " only ... magical set piece . " Ranking '' Beauty and the Beast : Original Motion Picture Soundtrack '' as Disney 's greatest soundtrack , Moviefone 's Sandie Angulo Chen highlighted " Be Our Guest " , noting its " infectious quality " while hailing it as an " amazing food chorus line . " JoBlo.com wrote that " Be Our Guest " is both " eye-popping " and " impossibly catchy . " Orbach 's performance as Lumiere has also garnered significant praise . Filmtracks.com commented , " the ever popular ' Be Our Guest ' ... flourish es due to a spirited lead performance by Jerry Orbach . " Similarly , Hollywood.com cited in the website 's biography of the actor , " Among the highlights of '' Beauty and the Beast '' was Orbach 's delivery of the showstopping number ' Be Our Guest ' . " Several critics have awarded specific praise to " Be Our Guest " 's choreography , comparing it extensively to the work of director and choreographer Busby Berkeley . In addition to hailing " Be Our Guest " as " delightful , " Candice Russel of the '' Sun-Sentinel '' wrote , " In setting the table for Belle , Lumiere and friends concoct a Busby Berkeley song-and-dance extravaganza . " The '' Deseret News ' '' Chris Hicks described " the Busby Berkeley-style ' Be Our Guest ' " as " first-rate . " Lisa Schwarzbaum of '' Entertainment Weekly '' highlighted the scene , writing , " The set pieces are narcotically pleasing , especially the Busby Berkeley-style dancing-kitchenware spectacular , ' Be Our Guest ' . " James Berardinelli of '' ReelViews '' coined " ' Be Our Guest ' ... the animated equivalent of Broadway show-stoppers , with all the energy and audacity of something choreographed by Busby Berkeley . " Calling it a " wonderful musical number , " Roger Ebert enthused , " ' Be Our Guest ' is a rollicking invitation to Belle from the castle staff , choreographed like Busby Berkeley running amok . " In review of the 2011 3D re-release of '' Beauty and the Beast '' , Stephen Whitty of '' The Star-Ledger '' commented , " The illusion of depth does add more life to the enchanted housewares — particularly the ' Be Our Guest ' number , with its Busby Berkeley geometrics . " While '' Beauty and the Beast '' 's several theatrical re-releases and reissues have been met with generally mixed reviews , critical response towards the " Be Our Guest " musical sequence has remained predominantly positive . Reviewing the 2001 IMAX re-release of the film , the '' Los Angeles Times ' '' Charles Solomon felt that the inclusion of the deleted song " Human Again " was unnecessary , preferring " Be Our Guest " and writing , " a second major production number simply is n't needed ; ' Be Our Guest ' is sufficient . " Similarly , the '' Seattle Post-Intelligencer '' 's William Arnold wrote , " On the other hand , it 's understandable why " Human Again " was cut from the original . It 's almost too similar to the film 's show-stopper , ' Be Our Guest ' . " Reviewing the film 's 2012 3D conversion , Todd Gilchrist of '' Boxoffice '' wrote that " Be Our Guest " is " effective , immersive and maybe even memorable . " Meanwhile , Annlee Ellingson of '' Paste '' wrote , " It 's thrilling to experience this film 's major set pieces on the big screen again , especially the Broadway-infused ' Be Our Guest ' number . " '' The Times-Picayune '' 's Mike Scott wrote , " But then the 3-D all but disappears until the ' Be Our Guest ' number -- with its artfully surreal dance of the dishes . " Andrew Pulver of '' The Guardian '' , who otherwise criticized the film 's songs , praised " Be Our Guest " , writing , " Apart from the spectacular Busby Berkeleyesque ' Be Our Guest ' , the film pretty much grinds to a halt whenever one of the songs ... starts up . " Likewise , Neil Smith of '' Total Film '' concluded that " only ‘ Be Our Guest ’ and the ballroom swoop really benefit from a stereoscopic make-over that does n't do the hand-drawn remainder many favours . " Although vastly critically acclaimed , the song did receive some minor criticism . Lukewarmly , Irving Tan of Sputnikmusic commented , " numbers like ' Be Our Guest ' provides evidence that Lumiere and co. are infinitely preferable as entertaining flatware . " On Lansbury 's performance , Tan joked , " The singer 's delightfully personable contribution is '' almost '' reason enough to forgive Disney for thinking her English accent ... would not look out of place in a film set in 18th century France . " A more negative review was written by Pete Vonder Haar of '' The Houston Press '' . Observing that '' Beauty and the Beast '' " was Disney 's first stab at incorporating computer animation , " he felt that " the results are , now , pretty primitive , " concluding , " I recall thinking the dancing forks during ' Be Our Guest ' ... looked pretty bad and time has not been kind . " The song has also been compared to " Under the Sea " from '' The Little Mermaid '' , most of which have been mixed . Jay Boyar the '' Orlando Sentinel '' opined , " ' Be Our Guest ' ... is the closest thing in '' Beauty and the Beast '' to the bubbly ' Under the Sea ' extravaganza in '' The Little Mermaid '' , " while '' Entertainment Weekly '' 's Owen Gleiberman 's review was much more negative , describing the song as " merely serviceable " and concluding , ' Be Our Guest , ' ... sorry to say , is no ' Under the Sea ' . " Likewise , Desson Howe '' '' of '' The Washington Post '' panned both the song and Lumiere , writing , " the Candelabrum 's Maurice Chevalier accent is clearly intended to substitute for the Caribbean-lilted lobster in '' Mermaid '' . And the ensemble song , ' Be Our Guest , ' in which the household gadgets enjoin Belle to live with them , is an obvious attempt to reprise a similar '' Mermaid '' number , ' Under the Sea . ' But it 's just under par . " Alongside the songs " Beauty and the Beast " and " Belle , " " Be Our Guest " was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song at the 64th Academy Awards in 1992 . Having garnered three separate Academy Award nominations for Best Original Song , '' Beauty and the Beast '' became the first film in the history of the Academy Awards to achieve this rare feat ; this would not be repeated until '' Dreamgirls '' was nominated for the award '' '' in 2007 . Ultimately , " Be Our Guest " lost to the film 's title song . In an interview with '' Entertainment Weekly '' , '' Beauty and the Beast '' producer Don Hahn revealed that Disney feared that having three songs nominated for Best Original Song would result in a draw or three-way tie . Therefore , while " Beauty and the Beast " received heavy promotion from the studio , significantly less was given to " Be Our Guest " and " Belle . " " Be Our Guest " was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song at the 49th Golden Globe Awards in 1992 , losing again to " Beauty and the Beast . " In 2004 , the American Film Institute nominated " Be Our Guest " for its " 100 Years … 100 Songs " ranking

" He said , " Patrick is the definition of stupid and his antics will have you laughing out loud . " In a review published in 2007 , Peter Keepnews of '' The New York Times '' said , " Patrick is a popular character , and the new episodes illustrate why : He is unfailingly enthusiastic , touchingly loyal and absolutely undeterred by his intellectual limitations .

To be there , and not be there .

" ( Manchester has never recorded a song for a James Bond film . ) Farber called the choice of Crow " the worst hire since A-ha fronted one of these themes .

		The show received a mixed reception from media publications . On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes , the show holds an approval rating of 43 % based on 30 critics , and summarized , " The 90th Academy Awards played it safe and hit no major snags -- but by clocking in at over four hours , returning host Jimmy Kimmel and company wore out their welcome long before the surprise ending . " Hank Stuever of '' The Washington Post '' marked , " In his second year , Kimmel has shown that the telecast need n't be anything but sharp and sure , with a funny host whose bits are manageable , shareable and – best of all – forgotten . We 're not making showbiz history here ; we 're just trying to get through another Oscar night . " Chief critic David Edelstein of '' Vulture '' wrote , " This was the best , most inspiring , and most sheerly likable Academy Awards telecast I 've ever seen . ... It was also – in terms of the actual awards – among the most disappointing . " '' Vanity Fair '' s , Richard Lawson wrote , " As a host , Kimmel struck a careful , appropriately measured tone ... All told , Sunday 's ceremony did an admirable job of recognizing all the turmoil surrounding it while maintaining the silly , chintzy trappings that so many of us tune into the Oscars for . " CNN 's Brian Lowry quipped , " The Oscars are a big , unwieldy beast , which invariably try to serve too many masters . Yet if the intent was ultimately to maintain a celebratory tone without ignoring either the outside world or the elephant in the room throughout this year 's awards , host Jimmy Kimmel and the show itself largely succeeded . " Others were more critical of the show . Television critic Maureen Ryan of '' Variety '' said , " All things considered , the show had a more or less low-key vibe . Normally it takes about two hours for the numbing effect to set in , but despite host Jimmy Kimmel 's best efforts , Sunday 's telecast started to feel a bit languid and low-energy far earlier . " Television critic James Poniewozik of '' The New York Times '' said , " despite the recent upheaval in Hollywood , the ceremony at large still focused mainly on celebration and glitter literally , in the case of the blinding set , which looked as if the ceremony were encased in an enormous geode . There 's also the perennial problem of bloat . The hitch , of course , is that every part of the show has its constituency . " Darren Franich of '' Entertainment Weekly '' wrote , " What fun we had at this year 's Oscars ! Long show , sure , but where to cut it ? " Writing for '' Deadline '' Greg Evans said , " Did the nearly four-hour running time contain any moments for the Oscar ages ? Probably not . " David Wiegand of the '' San Francisco Chronicle '' wrote , " Even the hope that the noise of clapping might keep the audience at home and in the theater awake , there was little of that for anything except the entrance of actors of advance age . " '' The Oregonian '' columnist Kristi Turnquist wrote , " Was it respectful ? Absolutely . Did it make for kind of a dull , earnest Oscars show ? Yeah , kind of . " Attaining 26.5 million U.S. viewers according to Nielsen ratings , the ceremony 's telecast had a 16-percent drop in viewership from last year 's ceremony and had the lowest U.S. viewership in Oscar history . On March 6 , after the final ratings were confirmed , President Donald Trump took to his Twitter account , saying , " Lowest rated Oscars in HISTORY . Problem is , we do n't have stars anymore – except your President ( just kidding , of course ) ! " . In response , Kimmel also tweeted , saying , " Thanks , lowest rated President in HISTORY . " In July 2018 , the ceremony presentation received eight nominations for the 70th Primetime Creative Arts Emmys

		Some media outlets received the broadcast positively . '' St. Louis Post-Dispatch '' television critic Gail Pennington praised Stewart 's performance as host writing that he " did the Oscars proud Sunday night , turning in a four-star hosting performance that unfortunately made the rest of the show seem sluggish by comparison . " Film critic Roger Ebert said that Stewart was " on target , topical and funny , " and added , " He was as relaxed , amusing and at home as Johnny Carson . " Columnist Ray Richmond of '' The Hollywood Reporter '' commented , " He seemed at times nervous and self-conscious , but on the whole , Stewart delivered with just the right balance of reverence and smugness . " Others media publications were more critical of the show . Television critic Rob Owen of the '' Pittsburgh Post-Gazette '' wrote that Stewart was more " amusing than funny " . He added , " Many of his jokes fell flat with the stars in the Kodak Theatre , and his tendency to bow down before celebrities quickly grew tiresome . " Tom Shales from '' The Washington Post '' commented , " It 's hard to believe that professional entertainers could have put together a show less entertaining than this year 's Oscars , hosted with a smug humorlessness by comic Jon Stewart , a sad and pale shadow of great hosts gone by . " Moreover , he derided the " piles and piles and miles and miles of clips from films present and past " writing that it " squandered the visual luster " of the ceremony . Associated Press television critic Frazier Moore remarked , " Stewart , usually a very funny guy , displayed a lack of beginner 's luck as first-time host ... His usually impeccable blend of puckishness and self-effacement fell flat in the service of Oscar . " He also criticized the decision to play music over the winner 's acceptance speeches calling it " distracting and obnoxious . " The American telecast on ABC drew in an average of 38.94 million people over its length , which was an 8 % decrease from the previous year 's ceremony . Additionally , the show earned lower Nielsen ratings compared to the previous ceremony with 23.0 % of households watching over a 35 share . Furthermore , it garnered a lower 1849 demo rating with a 13.9 rating among viewers in that demographic

		The show received a negative reception from most media publications . Associated Press television critic Frazier Moore lamented that Crystal " seemed incredibly listless " . He also questioned the purpose of the " Year of the Woman " theme writing , " The Oscar show itself seemed at odds with its own feminist theme . " Robert Bianco from the '' Pittsburgh Post-Gazette '' derided Allen 's musical production numbers , comparing them to the disastrous opening number at the 61st ceremony held in 1989 . Columnist Matt Roush of '' USA Today '' complained , " Crystal , in a by-now-familiar performance , has , in four years , taken a plum assignment and , by repetition , reduced it to shtick . " He also wrote that , " The song medley is getting old hat , " and the " smug references to his flop '' Mr. Saturday Night '' were out of an improv amateur night . " The telecast also received unfavorable reaction from various public feminist figures . In an interview with '' Los Angeles Daily News '' author and activist Betty Friedan condemned the " Year of the Woman " theme commenting , " It had no basis in reality . On behalf of women directors , cinematographer , and producers , I resent the travesty of calling that a tribute . " Likewise , President of the National Organization for Women 's Los Angeles chapter Tammy Bruce chastised ceremony 's feminist tribute as " one of the most hypocritical , patronizing things I saw in my whole life . " In response , Gil Cates responded towards the criticism of the theme stating , " The theme developed and raised consciousness in a way that I think is positive , not only for the individual in general but for individual women specifically . " He also quoted an ancient Chinese proverb later made famous by former U.S. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt saying , " It is better to light one candle than to curse the darkness " Despite the adverse reception , the ABC broadcast drew in an average of 45.7 million people over its length , which was a 3 % increase from the previous year 's ceremony . The show also drew higher Nielsen ratings compared to the previous ceremony with 31.2 % of households watching over a 51 share .

		On January 27 , 2011 the festival sent 9 filmmakers to 9 cities across the US to screen and discuss their films . The cities and films included : Bob Tourtellotte of Reuters wrote " Sundance 2011 has proven to be exceptionally strong , audiences and filmmakers seem to agree . " Tourtellotte reported that Robert Redford said that three years ago the Sundance Institute " set out to get back to its roots of supporting alternative voices in cinema and he felt like this year that strategy paid off . " Redford said " This year , what has excited me , is I think the quality is increasing in diversity and is increasing in depth . " The AP reported that Redford said it 's " always a relief " when the festival ends because " it 's really exhausting . " Kenneth Turan , film critic for the '' Los Angeles Times '' , wrote " though the festival has gotten ever bigger — and ( thankfully ) more efficient in moving its close to 50,000 attendees in and out of its far-flung theaters — it still retains the scrappy , antic spirit that has animated it from the start . " Turan wrote " One of the paradoxes of Sundance is that the quirkiness and charm around the edges of the festival are not always fully appreciated because so much of the media focus is on the premieres section and the U.S. dramatic competition " which he said " are , frankly , often the weakest parts of the festival . " Turan said " Sundance 's insistence on giving equal weight to documentaries and dramas has made it into as important a nonfiction showcase as any festival in the world ; witness the fact that four out of the five Oscar-nominated docs this year debuted at Sundance last January . " He also wrote that the foreign language film competition " is a strength at Sundance , and yet that field is given even less popular attention than the documentaries . " Peter Knegt wrote that this year 's festival " probably wo n't replicate last year 's Oscar record . " He said " Despite a huge surge in sales , this year 's Sundance slate looks like it might be the least Oscar-friendly in some time . " He noted that the U.S. Dramatic Grand Jury Prize winners have been nominated for Best Picture for two years ( referring to '' Precious '' and '' Winter 's Bone '' ) . Knegt speculated on films that might be nominated for the Oscars . Films he deemed " most likely to succeed " at being nominated included : '' Like Crazy '' for Best Picture , Michael Shannon of '' Take Shelter '' for Best Actor , Elizabeth Olsen of '' Martha Marcy May Marlene '' for Best Actress , Felicity Jones of '' Like Crazy '' for Best Actress , Jessica Chastain of '' Take Shelter '' for Best Supporting Actress , '' Project Nim '' for Best Documentary Feature , '' Page One '' for Best Documentary Feature , and '' The Interrupters '' for Best Documentary Feature . He wrote " It 's reasonable to feel assured that at least one of Sundance 's docs will end up an Oscar nominee , if not two , three or four . " Jada Yuan of '' New York '' magazine wrote " perhaps the biggest highlight of the festival is just how ripe it 's been for acquisitions , with nearly 30 films getting picked up , the most at any Sundance ever . " On " why everyone is suddenly so bullish on independent film " , Owen Gleiberman wrote that the " energy and optimism at Sundance this year was n't just hype . " He said the factors he thought were driving a new evolving vision of the indie film world included : " The deals have n’t gotten cheaper — they 've gotten smarter " , a belief that last year 's new festival director John Cooper and director of programming Trevor Groth " have re-energized the festival , heightening its quality and organizing the movies with a tempting new shape and vision " , video on demand gives distributors a safety net and more confidence , and the audiences for Sundance movies are not going away , saying " The Oscars ... have become a testament to the central place that Sundance movies now occupy . " Redford was happy about the success of the festival , with about 45 films being sold vs 14 in 2010 , an increase of about 220 % . Redford said studios are realizing " there are audiences " for indie films

		To be eligible for award consideration , the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences requires that a film be shown in a theater in Los Angeles County , California , for at least seven consecutive days during which it is advertised in print media . Studios hoping to position a film for some nominations usually satisfy that minimum requirement , then ease them into wide release from then until the nominations and/or awards ceremony . The flexibility this marketing strategy requires means that screens be available , and studios limit their releases of new films during this time to that end . As critic Ty Burr explained in a 2013 '' New York Times Magazine '' article on the mediocrity of new releases in the first month of the year : " T he studios ... know our attention is elsewhere . " New films shown publicly anywhere for the first time after January 1 themselves are ineligible for Oscars until the following year , by which time they will likely have been forgotten by critics , audiences and voters . '' The Silence of the Lambs '' , winner of the 1991 Academy Award for Best Picture , is a rare exception , as the only film in the post-studio era released in the first two months of its year to go on to win that Oscar . Burr calls it " the grand exception to the January Movies Will Never Amount to Anything rule , " and finds that only one other classic of the late 20th century , '' Dr. Strangelove '' , was a January release . The 2017 satirical horror film '' Get Out '' is another example of a movie released in the months of January and February that went on to be nominated for various Academy Awards such as Best Picture , eventually winning one for Best Original Screenplay

At least one Mi-26 belonging to a branch of China 's civil aviation service was used to bring heavy earth moving tractors to the quake-lakes at Tangjiashan mountain , located in difficult terrain and accessible only by foot or air

Already since the early summer of 1943 , German troops had been pouring into Greece , fearing an Allied landing there ( in fact falling victims to a grand-scale Allied strategic deception operation , " Operation Barclay " ) . Soon they became involved in wide-ranging counterguerrilla operations , which they carried out with great ruthlessness , based on their experiences in Yugoslavia . In the course of these operations , mass reprisals were carried out , resulting in war crimes such as at Kommeno on August 16 , the Massacre of Kalavryta in December and the Massacre of Distomo in June 1944 .

		Paris started mobilizing for war in September 1939 , when Nazi Germany attacked Poland , but the war seemed far away until May 10 , 1940 , when the Germans attacked France and quickly defeated the French army . The French government departed Paris on June 10 , and the Germans occupied the city on June 14 . During the Occupation , the French Government moved to Vichy , and Paris was governed by the German military and by French officials approved by the Germans . For Parisians , the Occupation was a series of frustrations , shortages and humiliations . A curfew was in effect from nine in the evening until five in the morning ; at night , the city went dark . Rationing of food , tobacco , coal and clothing was imposed from September 1940 . Every year the supplies grew more scarce and the prices higher . A million Parisians left the city for the provinces , where there was more food and fewer Germans . The French press and radio contained only German propaganda .

		Operation Steinadler ( 3 – 13 July 1944 ) was the last counter-insurgency operation carried out by German forces in Macedonia . Although wide in its scope it ultimately failed to achieve its objectives as ELAS fighters successfully evaded the German patrols , returning to their hideouts once the operation was over . The civilian population thus became the main target for Axis reprisals . Shortly afterwards the German 1st Mountain Division and the 4th SS Polizei Panzergrenadier Division departed from the country , while in August Army Group E declared Greece a war zone . German shops and cultural institutions were closed , while civilians and older member of the army , secret police and SS were evacuated . Under Adolf Hitler 's orders the Wehrmacht adopted the policy of total war , in response to the rise of ELAS subversive activity which had hampered the summer harvest in areas still controlled by the collaborationist government . Army Group E 's staff deemed the preceding Distomo massacre and 1 May 1944 Kaisariani executions as excessive and even damaging to the image of the occupational authorities . The staff stressed the need to arrest insurgents rather than resorting to the collective punishment of civilians . Nevertheless , those orders were disregarded and atrocities continued unhindered . Between June and August , ELAS attacks led to the death of 30 German soldiers , 14 were wounded and 9 more were missing in action . German reprisals in their turn included the execution of 254 people

		Perhaps the best known appearance of Cephalonia in popular culture is in the novel '' Captain Corelli 's Mandolin '' , by the English author Louis de Bernières . The book is believed to have been inspired by the village of Farsa , just outside Argostoli . The love story comprising the theme of the book is set before and after the Acqui Division massacre , during the Second World War . A film adaptation was released in 2001 . During filming there was lively debate between the production team , local authorities as well as groups of citizens , as to the complex historical details of the island 's antifascist resistance . As a result , political references were omitted from the film , and the romantic core of the book was preserved , without entering complex debates about the island 's history . In 2005 , Riccardo Milani made his TV movie , '' Cefalonia '' , also about the massacre , with music by Ennio Morricone

" He added : " Though those dramas are n't always interesting ( one could even say the character of Frédérique is completely beside the point ) , '' Making Plans for Lena '' is a gorgeous tapestry nonetheless . " Jordan Mintzer of '' Variety '' wrote : " While '' Love Songs '' and '' Dans Paris '' revealed prolific filmmaker Christophe Honore to be a direct descendant of the French New Wave , he heads straight into Arnaud Desplechin territory with the turbulent family drama '' Making Plans for Lena '' . " Meanwhile , Frank Scheck of '' The Hollywood Reporter '' commented that " Mastroianni provides a vividly intense turn in the title role , but the film 's narrative diffuseness and excessive stylization defeats her best efforts . " He called it " a misstep from one of that country 's most acclaimed filmmakers . " At the 35th César Awards , Alex Beaupain was nominated for the Best Original Music award

		Tom Dawson of '' Total Film '' thought " Erskine 's '' One Night In Turin '' argues that the endeavours of Bobby Robson 's players eased the memories of Heysel and Hillsborough , leading to a rebirth of the national game ... " Richard Luck of ''Film4.com '' said , " More compelling still is Erskine 's insistence that , as disappointing as defeat might have been , the way England played throughout Italia 90 went a long way towards soothing the nightmares of Heysel , Bradford and Hillsborough . It 's a well-constructed argument that points up the insignificance of victory and defeat in the greater scheme of things . " He added : " One night in Turin might have restored national pride but it pointed towards the selfishness that has since ruined the beautiful game . " Kevin Pocock of '' Den of Geek '' rated the film 2/5 and described is as " a well-constructed , finely narrated , re-stitching of that titular night in Turin , intriguing for those who did n't witness the events when they happened , and equally so for those who have n't mulled it to death since . " Robert Beames of '' What Culture '' thought " ... anyone with an interest in football history ( or even anyone nostalgic for Italia ’ 90 ) will find themselves engaged and excited by all this material . However , if you have no interest in football ( and have no memory of 1990 ) , then it would hard to you getting anything out of this documentary film . " Ronald Short of '' College Movie Review '' scored the film a D - and said , " For an indie film , it 's decent . I 'm sure the soccer fans will love it , but as for the rest of us ? It 's nothing really worth watching . " Mark Douglas of '' The Journal '' described it as " It is an unashamedly enjoyable hour and a half . " He added : " Perhaps the film might have been beefed up by a few talking heads slots , which would have given the main protagonists an opportunity to expand on their roles in this particular passion play . " Edward Porter of '' The Sunday Times '' said , " Like many an England performance , it 's the work of a team making the best of limited resources . Not only are there no interviews , but the footage of the game — and of all the other matches covered in the build-up — is patchy . " Peter Martin of '' Twitch Film '' thought " Much time and care was spent on the recreations , but they have an odd flavor , with the majority of them consisting of unnecessary inserts that stick out from the archival material like a series of sore thumbs . " He added : " Gary Oldman , who narrates , speaks in flat , even tones ... It 's a refreshing , realistic approach , but it 's undermined by the recreations . I wonder if all that time and effort would n't have been better served by integrating modern-day interviews providing historical perspective , such as the interview with author Pete Davies that 's included as one of the extras . " David Edwards of the '' Mirror.co.uk '' said , " '' One Night In Turin '' ... provides an entertaining look at how manager Bobby Robson became a national hero and Gazza 's tears made him a celebrity . Crucially , though , it fails to tell us anything we did n't already know . " Anthony Quinn of '' The Independent '' said thought " The director James Erskine catches something of the mood ( " Nessun Dorma " is in there too ) , but offers nothing in the way of perspective or second thoughts . " Philip French of '' The Observer '' said , " The film is strictly for nostalgists and students of visual and verbal clichés . " Phil of De Semlyen of '' Empire '' rated the film 2/5 and called it " Nostalgic viewing for fans that offers up too little by way of fresh insights . " Peter Bradshaw of '' The Guardian '' said , " As it is , '' One Night in Turin '' looks a bit like a DVD given away with a Sunday newspaper – but watchable , nevertheless . " Wendy Idle of '' The Times '' said , " All documentaries tend to nudge reality towards a slightly heightened sense of drama but this is like taking a shameless dive in the penalty area : a little undignified .

The book is believed to have been inspired by the village of Farsa , just outside Argostoli . The love story comprising the theme of the book is set before and after the Acqui Division massacre , during the Second World War . A film adaptation was released in 2001 . During filming there was lively debate between the production team , local authorities as well as groups of citizens , as to the complex historical details of the island 's antifascist resistance . As a result , political references were omitted from the film , and the romantic core of the book was preserved , without entering complex debates about the island 's history .

The troops voted overwhelmingly to fight their former allies the Germans , thus the '' Acqui '' became one of the very few Italian units to actively resist the Germans .

Already since the early summer of 1943 , German troops had been pouring into Greece , fearing an Allied landing there ( in fact falling victims to a grand-scale Allied strategic deception operation , " Operation Barclay " ) . Soon they became involved in wide-ranging counterguerrilla operations , which they carried out with great ruthlessness , based on their experiences in Yugoslavia . In the course of these operations , mass reprisals were carried out , resulting in war crimes such as at Kommeno on August 16 , the Massacre of Kalavryta in December and the Massacre of Distomo in June 1944 .

		The Wuwei Bronze Cannon ( 武威銅火炮 - Wǔwēi tóng huǒpào ) or Xi Xia Bronze cannon ( 西夏铜火炮 - Xīxià tóng huǒpào ) was discovered in 1980 and is probably the oldest and largest cannon dated to the 13th century . This 100 centimeter long , 108 kilogram bronze cannon was discovered in a cellar in Wuwei , Gansu Province . It bears no inscription , but has been dated by historians to the late Western Xia period between 1214 and 1227 through contextual evidence . The gun contained an iron ball about nine centimeters in diameter , which is smaller than the muzzle diameter at twelve centimeters , and 0.1 kilograms of gunpowder in it when discovered , meaning that the projectile might have been another co-viative . Ben Sinvany and Dang Shoushan believe that the ball used to be much larger prior to its highly corroded state at the time of discovery . While large in size , the weapon is noticeably more primitive than later Yuan dynasty guns such as the Xanadu Gun and Heilongjiang hand cannon , and is unevenly cast . A similar weapon was discovered not far from the discovery site in 1997 , but is much smaller in size at only 1.5 kg .

		The Shangyang ( ) , ( or shang yang ) in Chinese mythology was a rainbird ( i.e. it could predict rain ) . It was one of several important mythical birds in this tradition . The Shangyang was particularly associated with the Lord of Rain , Yu Shi . Once the Shangyang was supposed to have visited the royal court at Qi , where it performed a dance upon its one leg , whereupon an embassy was sent inquire of the meaning of this event to Confucius in the neighboring state of Lu : the Shangyang was known to Confucius , who predicted imminent heavy rain and advised the digging of drainage and the raising of dikes . As a result of following the sage 's advise , Qi was spared calamity due to the ensuing inundation , whereas the other states who did not heed the advice were heavily damaged . This legendary incident has been often used to illustrate the folly of those who refuse to heed the words of the wise . Mythographer Lihui Yang associates Yu Shi with the Bi Fang bird , instead .

		The oldest extant gun bearing a date of production is the Xanadu Gun , so called because it was discovered in the ruins of Xanadu ( Shangdu ) , the summer palace of the Yuan dynasty in Inner Mongolia , China . The Xanadu Gun is 34.7 cm in length and weighs 6.21 kg , its muzzle is flared outwards , slightly bowl - shape , and called by Chinese as 碗口铳 ( Wǎn kǒu chòng ) . Its dating is based on archaeological context and a straightforward inscription containing an era name and year that correspond with the Gregorian Calendar at 1298 . Not only does the inscription contain the era name and date , it also includes a serial number and manufacturing information which suggests that gun production had already become systematized , or at least become a somewhat standardized affair by the time of its fabrication . The design of the gun includes axial holes in its rear which some speculate could have been used in a mounting mechanism . Like most early guns with the possible exception of the Western Xia gun ( the Wuwei bronze cannon ) , it is small , weighing just over six kilograms and thirty - five centimeters in length . Although the Xanadu Gun is the most precisely dated gun from the 13th century , other extant samples with approximate dating may be older .

		Famines became common in northern China in the early 17th century because of unusually dry and cold weather that shortened the growing season – effects of a larger ecological event now known as the Little Ice Age . Famine , alongside tax increases , widespread military desertions , a declining relief system , and natural disasters such as flooding and inability of the government to properly manage irrigation and flood-control projects caused widespread loss of life and normal civility . The central government , starved of resources , could do very little to mitigate the effects of these calamities . Making matters worse , a widespread epidemic spread across China from Zhejiang to Henan , killing an unknown but large number of people .

		Having noticed the advantages of the combination of social media and Phoneography , some well-known newspapers , news magazines and professional photojournalists decided to employ iPhone journalism as a new approach . When the London Bombings happened in July 2005 , for the first time , both the '' New York Times '' and the '' Washington Post '' ran photos on their front pages made by citizen journalists with camera phones . As work of witnesses and survivors , the images were less the outcome of documentary intent than a response to a traumatic shock . These photos represented ' vivid , factual accounts of history as it explodes around us ' , as described by '' Washington Post '' journalist Robert MacMillan . In another instance , when superstorm Sandy hit the East Coast , causing great damage and casualty , Time sent out five photographers with iPhones to document the devastation . Photographers dived deep into the site and captured pictures in close proximity to the storm and human suffering . One of the shots , raging ocean waves collapsing on Coney Island in Brooklyn , taken by Benjamin Lowy , made the cover of Time 's November 12 issue . Then in 2013 , the Chicago Sun-Times got rid of its entire staff of 28 photographers , including John H. White , a Pulitzer Prize winner in photography . The newspaper cited viewers shifting towards more video as a reason . They then employed freelance photographers and required them to train in how to use an iPhone for photography to fill the gap . Some viewers online were quick to point out an at times reduction in quality in comparison to the newspaper 's previous full-time professionals

		Yuval Diskin stated Nawi should be jailed quickly but cautioned that " the data shows that there is no basis for comparison between violence coming from the right and violence coming from the left . " B'tselem commented on its Facebook page that while opposed to tortures and executions , reporting Palestinians who intend to sell Israelis Palestinian land was “ the only legitimate course of action . ” Attorney Leah Tsemel , who defends Palestinian rights , said the complaint would not be difficult to deal with . Gideon Levy criticized Uvda 's presentation , writing that it systematically ignored the crimes of Israel 's occupation of the West Bank , and noted that Nawi was being likened to the perpetrators of the Duma arson attack . Both Levy and Amira Hass wrote that Uvda had failed its brief as an outlet for investigative journalism by lending its services uncritically to what Levy called a McCarthyist right-wing organization about which nothing is known ( Levy ) or passing on a ' puff piece for a privatized , mini-Shin Bet ' ( Hass ) . They say that no background research on the sources or the contexts had been conducted . For David Shulman , Nawi 's work is one of the main reasons why the civilian Palestinian population in the South Hebron hills still maintains a precarious purchase on fragments of their historic lands , and the entire episode , mounted by " moles " from a shadowy organization to discredit him has , he concludes , all the appearance of a sting operation to trap him and ' legitimize the theft of Palestinian land . ' Nawi 's story has been recounted in two documentary films . In 2005 , Canadian-Jewish filmmaker Elle Flanders made a documentary entitled '' Zero Degree of Separation '' , which intertwined the story of her family in Jerusalem , for whom Ezra Nawi once worked as a gardener , with the lives of two gay couples , one of which was Nawi and his companion . In 2007 , a further film about Nawi 's life and work , ' Citizen Nawi ' ( '' HaEzrach Nawi '' ) directed by Nissim Mossek and produced by Sharon Schaveet , premiered at the Jerusalem Film Festival , where it won a special jury mention . The film documents the plight of the Bedouin , the difficulties of Israeli-Palestinian relations , and the hardships of being gay . Made over five years on a shoe-string budget , it was judged a somewhat messy docu by '' Variety '' film critic Leslie Felperin , who thought its director " too in love with its subject to ask tough questions " . Yet , he added , it managed " to expose both Israeli and Arab bigotry and has its heart in the right liberal place " . Raya Morag sees the film as basically about deep-seated Israeli homophobia and racism . Dan DiLandro , reviewing for '' Educational Media Reviews , '' wrote that the film had a number of evident problems , technical and narrative , yet judged it " an important work that shed light on many of the area ’s conflicts and dynamics " . Michael Fox , writing for '' Jweekly '' , finds ' Citizen Nawi ' to be " a rough-hewn profile in courage that diligently tallies the cost of conscience " , and writes of the " discomfiting power " of a " raw and occasionally wrenching film " , which stirs a " certain cognitive dissonance " when one " sees Nawi threatened and insulted in the crudest terms by religious Jewish settlers and embraced as a trusted friend by a Palestinian family living in a tent " . For Fox , as the film follows Nawi 's travails with his lover , run-ins with the police , and battles with settlers , it suddenly jolts one out of the initial impression that Nawi 's activism has liberal roots : - " One just assumes that Nawi has always been a liberal , and that his treks to the West Bank reflect a longstanding empathy for the Palestinians . It comes as a shock when he remarks well into the film that he was n't particularly aware of or concerned about their day-to-day hardships until he got involved with Fuad " . Nawi 's instincts , Fox concludes , are those of the humanist , and the director Mossek 's gutsiest move was to have made " a film that does n't aim to inspire us with platitudes but instead tries to shock us with the hard business of building a road to peace "

		Under Yitzhak Rabin , the Israeli government proposed closing down the settlement at Tel Rumeida after the Cave of the Patriarchs massacre . Far-right rabbis moved to block evacuation of the settlements by issuing an Halakhic ruling against removal of settlements in Eretz Israel . The collective influence of the settlers and their Rabbis , in what one scholar has called , ' one of the most effective mobilization efforts in settler history , ' persuaded Prime Minister Rabin to back down . The Dir al-Arba ' in mosque , where Hebronite Palestinians had prayed until the mid-1990s , was declared a closed military zone , and converted into a synagogue , renamed by settlers '' Tomb of Ruth and Jesse '' , and thenceforth all access to it by Muslims was forbidden ostensibly for security reasons . According to Karin Aggestam , attempts to convert the mosque into a Jewish national shrine , including painting its door blue , are in violation of the Hebron Protocol , which committed both Israel and Palestine to preserving and protecting the historic character of the city without harm or changes . During the Al-Aqsa Intifada , the Jewish settlement came under regular fire from Palestinian militants

Guy Lodge in Variety wrote that " “ '' A Blast '' director Syllas Tzoumerkas returns with an agitated , atmospheric and sometimes confounding exercise in modern Greek tragedy . Tzoumerkas ’ latest invites comparisons to the loopier , trash-skirting genre outings of Herzog or Lynch , with the gradual unpeeling of layered madness and corruption in the sleepy working town of Missolonghi occasionally calling to mind an aggressively sunburned '' Twin Peaks '' " . Savina Petkova of the Electric Ghost gave the film 5/5 stars , writing that " while the film is saturated with Biblical quotes , icons of saints , and church choir songs , its form attends equally to the lowly human , animal , and nature . Pacifying all forms of life under the flag of future deliverance , the promise that each being will attain their most perfect form and self , '' The Miracle of the Sargasso Sea '' provides a convergence between religious submission and humanistic agency . ” Victoria Ferguson in the Upcoming gave the film a 3/5 review praising the cinematography by Petrus Sjövik and " its close shots that capture the inner angst of the characters " and calling '' The Miracle of the Sargasso Sea '' visually compelling , and ' a show of great creative ambition from Tzoumerkas . ” Italian critic Massimo Lechi wrote in '' Il Ragazzo Selvaggio '' magazine that “ '' The Miracle of the Sargasso Sea '' , set in the inhospitable surroundings of a sun-parched Missolonghi , is a metaphysical thriller loaded with biblical references , an unsettling and disturbing meditation on the concept of paradise featuring two women in profound existential crisis : Elisabeth , ( a master Angeliki Papoulia ) a disgraced policewoman confined in the province by her superiors following an unfortunate anti-terrorist operation ; and Rita ( the brave Youla Boudali , also co-screenwriter ) , a painful figure of a martyr besieged by visions of a mystical background . Tzoumerkas ’ cinema is one that ’s not afraid of risk or ridicule , one which in fact , has the clear intent of forcing the limits of both the police genre and the auteur film genre , seducing with the skill of its performers and its disquieting aesthetic choices that are never banal . After '' Homeland '' ( 2010 ) and '' A Blast '' ( 2014 ) , '' The Miracle of the Sargasso '' is the third – and more complex – chapter of Tzoumerkas ’ ideal trilogy on contemporary Greece . ” '' The Miracle of the Sargasso Sea '' and Syllas Tzoumerkas were nominated for the Panorama Audience Award and the Teddy Award at the 69th Berlin International Film Festival

It is a red flag that there is no consistency of what they are , when they happen and where they happen . It is likely that there " is not one , known , proven phenomenon " . However , a significant amount of video footage has surfaced since the advent of sites like YouTube that claim to represent this — one example being the 2017 Mexico earthquake — although no consistent explanation has been agreed upon . There is also a " staggering volume of literature ... hardly any of these papers agree on anything ... I 'm forced to wonder how many of these eager researchers are familiar with Hyman 's Categorical Imperative : ' Do not try to explain something until you are sure there is something to be explained ' " .

Based on the Pinoy Komiks characters created by L. P. Calixto , it is a sequel to the 1980 film Mr. One - Two - Three . The film was released in theaters by GP Films on July 31 , 1981 , and was later reissued in early April 1988 . Critic Lav Diaz criticized the film as simplistically comical and cliché , with its gags already done before by Filipino comedians Dolphy , Chiquito , and Cachupoy , though he noted that it demonstrates the then - current state of comedy films produced in the Philippines .

		Izzy Stradlin , who left the band in November 1991 , later stated that replacing Adler with Matt Sorum of The Cult had a big impact on the band 's sound . In response to an interviewer 's suggestion that the line-up change had turned Guns N ' Roses from a rock 'n' roll band into a heavy metal one , Stradlin said , " Yeah , a big musical difference . ... Our songs were written with Steve playing the drums and his sense of swing was the push and pull that give the songs their feel . When that was gone , it was just ... unbelievable , weird . Nothing worked . I would have preferred to continue with Steve , but we 'd had two years off and we could n't wait any longer . " Following his departure from Guns N ' Roses , according to Adler , he was set to join AC/DC and relocate to Australia . However , during the MTV Video Music Awards in September 1990 , Axl Rose announced Adler 's firing onstage and branded him a drug addict , which Adler said caused AC/DC 's manager to withdraw their offer . Adler instead reformed Road Crew with a new line-up , consisting of former Vain members singer Davy Vain , guitarist Jamie Scott , and bassist Ashley Mitchell , along with guitarist Shawn Rorie . They recorded an album and attracted attention from a major label , but due to Adler 's persistent drug problems , the group disbanded shortly thereafter . Adler then entered a prolonged , self-imposed exile from the music industry ; he later recalled , " I wish I could say that I did a lot of traveling or self-improvement , but all I actually did was sit on the couch and get high — while the TV watched me . It was a very , very hard time . " A year after his dismissal , in July 1991 , Adler filed a lawsuit against his former Guns N ' Roses band mates , contending that he was fired because the opiate-blocking drug he had been taking to aid his detox interfered with his concentration . He also alleged that the contract he had been made to sign took away his financial interest in the band , stating , " I was told that every time I did heroin , the band would fine me $ 2,000 . ... What these contracts actually said was that the band were paying me $ 2,000 to leave . They were taking my royalties , all my writing credits . They did n't like me any more and just wanted me gone . " The case was settled out of court in 1993 ; Adler received a back-payment check of $ 2,250,000 and was granted 15 % of the royalties for everything he recorded prior to his departure

		Michael Cohl is a Canadian concert promoter , theatrical producer and touring impresario . He is the former Chairman of Live Nation . Cohl now runs S2BN Entertainment , with offices in New York and Toronto . Having been named the Howard Hughes of rock ‘ n ’ roll by '' Fortune '' magazine , Cohl is most famous for having overseen the tours and related ancillary businesses for more than 150 artists , including Frank Sinatra , Michael Jackson , The Rolling Stones , Prince , Stevie Wonder , Pink Floyd , Crosby , Stills , Nash and Young and U2 . He has also been credited with developing the concept of " package " touring . Eliminating the middleman , Cohl worked directly with the artist to strategize and route the tour , promote the dates , and assist in the development and exploitation of the lucrative aftermarket – books , films , DVDs , television specials , and merchandising . He is currently the lead producer of '' Spider-Man : Turn Off the Dark '' , the most expensive musical in Broadway history , with music by Bono and The Edge of U2 . In December 1995 , The Toronto Star printed a 4,000 word article entitled " King Cohl of Rock 'n' Roll and the Tax That Never Was . " From conversations with a number of managers of touring bands , the reporter argued that Cohl 's Concert Productions International misrepresented to touring artists that it was collecting a tax , while not remitting any such tax to any government body . The tax was a phoney tax Cohl added onto every ticket he sold at Toronto 's CNE Stadium . Fans paid an extra $ 3 per ticket for Springsteen , U2 , and Stones tickets . According to Canadian government auditors , that $ 3 per ticket added up to $ 5 million , all of which was pocketed by Cohl . He avoided jail time but had to sell back his BCL Entertainment Ltd stock to Labatt 's . Cohl was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame , when he received a Walt Grealis Special Achievement Award at the 2002 Juno Awards . Cohl is also a recipient of the 2004 Billboard Legend of Live award , an honour previously bestowed on such artists as Elton John and The Allman Brothers Band . When '' Spamalot '' won the 2005 Drama Desk and Tony Award for Best Musical , Cohl was among the producers who received the awards . He was inducted in Canada 's Walk of Fame in 2005 Cohl has produced several Broadway musicals as well as numerous other international touring shows . These include : CBC Television released a 2006 documentary directed by acclaimed filmmaker Barry Avrich as part of the '' Life and Times '' series chronicling Cohl 's rise to prominence in the entertainment industry .

		Jam and Lewis were the primary instrumentalists for the recording , including percussion , piano , drums , and also provided background vocals . Jackson accompanied Jam and Lewis on keyboard and took part in composing the arrangements . Stephen Holden of '' The New York Times '' observed the album was prominent example of the developing relationship with musicians and modern technology , stating " ... technology has altered the form , shape , scale and even the meaning of popular music ... The album was n't created by a studio band , as were most pop-rock albums in the 1960s and '70s , but by the producers and the singer programming mechanized drum and keyboard textures . " Jackson 's father disapproved of the new material and image of '' Control '' , claiming it would never sell . In a cover story for '' Spin '' magazine titled " Damn It , Janet : The Battle for Control of Janet Jackson , " Joseph was reported saying " i f Janet listens to me , she 'll be as big as Michael . " She and McClain disregarded his objections . Commenting on the final product , Jackson stated : " It 's aggressive , cocky , very forward . It expresses exactly who I am and how I feel . I 've taken control of my own life . This time I 'm gon na do it my way . " Fashion photographer and illustrator Tony Viramontes created the stylized cover for the new album and the singles '' Nasty '' and '' Control '' . Jackson said of Viramontes , " He was very creative , and I believe one day his work will be iconic . He was such a joy to work with . I miss him . " Author Dean Rhys Morgan in '' Bold , Beautiful and Damned : The World of Fashion Illustrator Tony Viramontes '' discusses how Jackson was " transformed from a former child star into an assured fashion forward figure with her trendsetting big hair and severe all black ensemble . Until this point , Jackson had been more a reflection than pioneer , more interpreter than innovator . This album was all about Janet and who she wanted to be . " Alexander Fury wrote in '' The Independent '' , " the artwork created with Eighties illustrator Tony Viramontes for '' Control '' stands the test of time . " Although A&M did not consider a full concert tour to promote Jackson 's album , the label funded a three-week promotional tour across the United States in 13 cities following its release . In addition to the studio release , a remix album , '' Control : The Remixes '' , was released in select countries in November , 1987 . Jackson 's lyrical expression has been noted as one of the key elements of the album 's success . Author Dave Marsh in '' The Heart of Rock & Soul : The 1001 Greatest Singles Ever Made '' ( 1999 ) comments : " Certainly , Janet must have written her own lyrics , which went after men — in particular , not very well disguised stand-ins for her father and former husband — more venomously than another guy would have dared . '' Control '' , the resulting album , was one of the best-sellers of 1986 – 1987 , producing five hit singles . " Jesus Garber , then-director of A&M 's black music marketing and promotion , noted that in addition to crossover promotion from black to pop music charts , music video was utilized to launch Jackson into super stardom . Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine credits the release of '' Control '' as " the birth of Janet the music video star , as six of the nine tracks were turned into popular videos that all but announced her as queen of the production dance number . " Henderson commented that Jackson 's dancing ability , trained by a then-unknown Paula Abdul , only served to propel her into further stardom . Charlie Minor , then-senior vice president of promotion for A&M stated : " The images completed the image of Janet Jackson with the buyer ... They gave her a face , dance , action identity with the songs , and a visual image of her as a rock 'n' roll star . " Jonathan Cohen of '' Billboard '' magazine commented " Jackson 's accessible sound and spectacularly choreographed videos were irresistible to MTV , and helped the channel evolve from rock programming to a broader , beat-driven musical mix . " The video for " Nasty " received three nominations for the fifth annual 1987 MTV Video Music Awards , winning Best Choreography for Paula Abdul

		The name '' Devo '' comes from the concept of ' de-evolution ' — the idea that instead of continuing to evolve , mankind has actually begun to regress , as evidenced by the dysfunction and herd mentality of American society . In the late 1960s , this idea was developed as a joke by Kent State University art students Gerald Casale and Bob Lewis , who created a number of satirical art pieces in a devolution vein . At this time , Casale had also performed with the local band 15-60-75 ( The Numbers Band ) . They met Mark Mothersbaugh around 1970 , a talented keyboardist who had been playing with the band Flossy Bobbitt . Mothersbaugh brought a more humorous feel to the band , introducing them to material like the pamphlet " Jocko Homo Heavenbound " , which includes an illustration of a winged devil labelled " D-EVOLUTION " and would later inspire the song " Jocko Homo " . The " joke " about de-evolution became serious following the Kent State shootings of May 4 , 1970 . This event would be cited multiple times as the impetus for forming the band Devo .

However , by 1968 he was quickly feeling burnt out due to the heavy workload : " I was arranging 50 or 60 things a month and it was starting to kill me .

In June 1966 , Page joined The Yardbirds , and in 1967 Jones contributed to that band 's '' Little Games '' album . The following winter , during the sessions for Donovan 's '' The Hurdy Gurdy Man '' , Jones expressed to Page a desire to be part of any projects the guitarist might be planning . Later that year , The Yardbirds disbanded , leaving Page and bassist Chris Dreja to complete previously booked Yardbirds dates in Scandinavia .

		The Beatles performed the song in many of their early Hamburg shows , and also played it on the BBC show '' Pop Go The Beatles '' . In late 1964 , exhausted from non-stop touring and recording and short of original material , they decided to record several of their old rock and rhythm and blues favorites to fill out their LP release '' Beatles for Sale '' . Among these was a version of Berry 's tune that eventually became as well known as the original . The lead vocal in the Beatles ' version was performed by John Lennon . In contrast to Berry 's even-toned rendition , Lennon sang it as loudly and dynamically as his voice would permit . In the United States , it was released on the LP '' Beatles ' 65 '' . The song was part of the set list for the group 's final tour in 1966 – the performance from their show of June 30 at the Nippon Budokan was included in 1996 's '' Anthology 2 '' – and was also performed during the Get Back/Let It Be Sessions in January 1969 .

Tanya Bell of '' The Gazette '' wrote that the group " displayed enormous talent as it took them two hours to play 11 songs . " A staff writer for the '' Chicago Defender '' lauded his performance at the Chicago Theatre , calling it " an explosive mixture of R&B , soul and funk . " '' Rolling Stone '' called him " abundantly gifted , eye-poppingly spectacular " , " confident and worldly " in his performance at the House of Blues in Los Angeles . It compared the performance to his past concerts , stating " he 's alive onstage now , dancing , touching the audience , slamming his microphone down , lying on the ground at the lip of the stage to sing ' One Mo ' Gin ' while girls grab his legs , his stomach , his crotch . " In a review of D'Angelo 's tour-opening performance at the House of Blues , David Wollock of '' The Hollywood Reporter '' called it a " three-hour old-school soul marathon that was part ' Get Up ( I Feel Like Being a ) Sex Machine ' , part ' Let 's Get It On ' , part ' Move on Up ' gospel exuberance ... with call-and-response and other crowd-rousing church conventions " .

" Reviewing his March performance at New York City 's Radio City Music Hall , rock critic Robert Christgau dubbed D'Angelo " R&B Jesus " and proclaimed himself a " believer " . Christgau praised D'Angelo 's delivery and compared the concert to a 1981 P-Funk outing at the Apollo Theater , stating " D'Angelo sang and danced and preached and flexed and crooned and humped the floor and covered Roberta Flack and snapped a mike stand in two and danced and sang and sang some more . Everything meshed ; all stops were pulled out . It was already the greatest concert I 'd seen in years when Redman and Method Man propelled the climactic ' Left and Right ' through the vaulted ceiling . I flashed on P-Funk 's ' Sadie ' , Apollo 1981 . What a privilege to experience such a thing again . " He also compared it to Marvin Gaye in concert , writing that " I saw Marvin Gaye at this venue shortly before he was murdered , and it was no contest . Gaye was fine , but self-indulgent and riddled with blank spots . "

		Justin Timberlake and Chris Stapleton first collaborated at the 2015 Country Music Association Awards , performing " Tennessee Whiskey " and " Drink You Away " . Stapleton was initially only writing songs with Timberlake for the album , before being asked to sing on " Say Something " . He told '' Billboard '' , " I really just went out to Los Angeles to write songs with him , it 's a very fluid process with him , there 's a lot going on . That was one of those things where there was n't necessarily a plan . He was like ' All right , you hop in there and take a verse , ' and I 'm like , ' You want me to do what ? ' ... It came out great . I had a blast with him , he 's a great creative force and one of those guys that if you get a chance to work with him , you should . " " Say Something " is an upbeat country rock ballad that blends the electronic structures of '' Man of the Woods '' previously released songs " Filthy " and " Supplies " with Stapleton 's country blues styles . The song comprises elements of gospel , pop , acoustic soul and jazz . Timberlake and Timbaland previously incorporated country sounds such as twangy guitars on tracks like " What Goes Around ... Comes Around " . The song features lyrics about reflection and regret , meditating on social pressure to have something to say and being unsure if you really do . '' Nashville Scene '' writer Stephen Trageser interpreted the lyrics as : Directed by Arturo Perez Jr. and produced by La Blogothèque , the video was filmed using a technique known as " continuous motion " and shot in one take at the Bradbury Building in Los Angeles – famous for its appearance in the 1982 cult science fiction film '' Blade Runner '' – with elevators , balconies , and stairs that " personified the labyrinth " the concept required . The crew included 17 musicians and a 60-person choir , in order to record the video and audio live in only one take . The video starts with Timberlake alone in a room creating beats and effects on an MPC sampler . The camera follows him as he straps on an acoustic guitar and ascends up an elevator . Stepping out , he encounters Stapleton on a nearby staircase . The music video on YouTube has received over 315 million views as of July 2019 . It won Best Live Video at the 2018 UK Music Video Awards .

He told '' Billboard '' , " I really just went out to Los Angeles to write songs with him , it 's a very fluid process with him , there 's a lot going on . That was one of those things where there was n't necessarily a plan . He was like ' All right , you hop in there and take a verse , ' and I 'm like , ' You want me to do what ? ' ...

According to Sky News on March 25 , 2018 , " music critics have put the album 's success down to the feel-good , uplifting pop tunes which are also old school at the same time .

The women 's magazine '' Bustle '' gave it a positive review , particularly certain vocal performances . '' Stereogum '' described the soundtrack music as eclectic in its influences , giving it a negative reception for " serving up earnest buoyancy in many high-fructose flavors . " Also noting the eclectic mix of musical genres , '' The Ringer '' writes that " the bombastic tunes mix EDM gleams with stadium-rock grunts , chest-pounding ballads with peppy empowerment anthems , a thoroughly modern and disconcertingly eager post-genre assault designed to barnstorm as many Spotify playlists as possible . It 's a gilded cheese ball , pushing exhilaration to the point of exhaustion . " '' The Guardian '' wrote that the album brought " a whole lot of self-empowerment , enlivened with some deracinated R&B beats , and given the necessary gravitas by some power ballads of the sort that make one imagine the singer filmed from below with a wind machine blowing in their face .

		Crispi was replaced as prime minister by Antonio Di Rudinì in February 1891 , who was succeeded by Giovanni Giolitti in May 1892 . On January 20 , 1893 , when peasants of Caltavuturo occupied communal land that they claimed was theirs , local authorities killed 13 and wounded 21 in the Caltavuturo massacre . Disturbances continued throughout the year . The Fasci started out as urban movements , animated by artisans , which evolved into a more popular and combative mass movement with the adherence of sulphur miners , and in a later stage with the involvement of peasants and sharecroppers . In the autumn of 1893 , labour conflicts in the cities and the mines came together with the protests and claims of the farmers . The movement reached its greatest breadth in the manifestations against taxes , involving the lowest tiers of the city and the countryside , becoming difficult , if not impossible , to control by its leaders

		The Legion of Antibes was recruited under direction of Pope Pius IX 's secretary of state , Giacomo Antonelli , following the September Convention of 1864 , to replace French troops garrisoned in Rome , during the closing phase of Italian unification , the Risorgimento .

		Operation Steinadler ( 3 – 13 July 1944 ) was the last counter-insurgency operation carried out by German forces in Macedonia . Although wide in its scope it ultimately failed to achieve its objectives as ELAS fighters successfully evaded the German patrols , returning to their hideouts once the operation was over . The civilian population thus became the main target for Axis reprisals . Shortly afterwards the German 1st Mountain Division and the 4th SS Polizei Panzergrenadier Division departed from the country , while in August Army Group E declared Greece a war zone . German shops and cultural institutions were closed , while civilians and older member of the army , secret police and SS were evacuated . Under Adolf Hitler 's orders the Wehrmacht adopted the policy of total war , in response to the rise of ELAS subversive activity which had hampered the summer harvest in areas still controlled by the collaborationist government . Army Group E 's staff deemed the preceding Distomo massacre and 1 May 1944 Kaisariani executions as excessive and even damaging to the image of the occupational authorities . The staff stressed the need to arrest insurgents rather than resorting to the collective punishment of civilians . Nevertheless , those orders were disregarded and atrocities continued unhindered . Between June and August , ELAS attacks led to the death of 30 German soldiers , 14 were wounded and 9 more were missing in action . German reprisals in their turn included the execution of 254 people

		In May 1943 the division transferred for garrison duties to the Greek island of Cefalonia . After Italy 's surrender to the Allies on 3 September 1943 the divisions commanding general Antonio Gandin was left without clear orders from his superiors . Therefore , Gandin decided to let his soldiers vote on 13 September 1943 as to what to do to next . The troops voted overwhelmingly to fight their former allies the Germans , thus the '' Acqui '' became one of the very few Italian units to actively resist the Germans . The Germans therefore summarily executed over half of the divisions soldiers and all of its officers in revenge during the Massacre of the Acqui Division

This local war began the Balkans Campaign of World War II between the Axis powers and the Allies and eventually turned into the Battle of Greece with British and German involvement . On 10 June 1940 , Italy declared war on France and the United Kingdom . By September 1940 , the Italians had invaded France , British Somaliland and Egypt . This was followed by a hostile press campaign in Italy against Greece , accused of being a British ally . A number of provocations culminated in the sinking of the Greek light cruiser Elli by the Italians on 15 August ( the Christian Dormition of the Mother of God festival ) . On 28 October , Mussolini issued an ultimatum to Greece demanding the cession of Greek territory , which the Prime Minister of Greece , Ioannis Metaxas , rejected .

		According to Ehrenburg , the mandatory State literary commission did not commit to publish the book in October 1944 : " Instead of a straight answer , the resolution was : ' write the book , and if it comes out well , it would be published . ' But it is not we who are the authors , it is the fascists ... What does that mean , ' comes out well ' this is not a novel , it is a document . " The book was partially printed in the Soviet Union by the Yiddish publisher '' Der Emes '' , however the entire edition , the typefaces , as well as the manuscript , were destroyed . First the censors ordered changes in the text to conceal the specifically anti-Jewish character of the atrocities and to downplay the role of some Ukrainians who worked as Nazi police officers . In 1948 the Soviet edition of the book was scrapped completely . The collection of original documents that Ehrenburg handed down to the Vilnius Jewish Museum after the war was secretly returned to him upon the Museum 's termination in 1948 . The JAC was also disbanded , its members purged at the outset of the state campaign against the " rootless cosmopolitans " , a Soviet euphemism for Jews . ( See also the Doctors ' plot ) .

		The Germans now took over the Italian zone , and soon proved to be a totally different opponent from the demoralized , war-weary and far less brutal Italians . Already since the early summer of 1943 , German troops had been pouring into Greece , fearing an Allied landing there ( in fact falling victims to a grand-scale Allied strategic deception operation , " Operation Barclay " ) . Soon they became involved in wide-ranging counterguerrilla operations , which they carried out with great ruthlessness , based on their experiences in Yugoslavia . In the course of these operations , mass reprisals were carried out , resulting in war crimes such as at Kommeno on August 16 , the Massacre of Kalavryta in December and the Massacre of Distomo in June 1944 . At the same time , hundreds of villages were systematically torched and almost one million people left homeless

		<noinclude> </noinclude> The Greco - Italian War ( Italo - Greek War , Italian Campaign in Greece ; in Greece : War of '40 ) took place between the kingdoms of Italy and Greece from 28 October 1940 to 23 April 1941 . This local war began the Balkans Campaign of World War II between the Axis powers and the Allies and eventually turned into the Battle of Greece with British and German involvement . On 10 June 1940 , Italy declared war on France and the United Kingdom . By September 1940 , the Italians had invaded France , British Somaliland and Egypt . This was followed by a hostile press campaign in Italy against Greece , accused of being a British ally . A number of provocations culminated in the sinking of the Greek light cruiser Elli by the Italians on 15 August ( the Christian Dormition of the Mother of God festival ) . On 28 October , Mussolini issued an ultimatum to Greece demanding the cession of Greek territory , which the Prime Minister of Greece , Ioannis Metaxas , rejected .

		Operation Steinadler ( 3 – 13 July 1944 ) was the last counter-insurgency operation carried out by German forces in Macedonia . Although wide in its scope it ultimately failed to achieve its objectives as ELAS fighters successfully evaded the German patrols , returning to their hideouts once the operation was over . The civilian population thus became the main target for Axis reprisals . Shortly afterwards the German 1st Mountain Division and the 4th SS Polizei Panzergrenadier Division departed from the country , while in August Army Group E declared Greece a war zone . German shops and cultural institutions were closed , while civilians and older member of the army , secret police and SS were evacuated . Under Adolf Hitler 's orders the Wehrmacht adopted the policy of total war , in response to the rise of ELAS subversive activity which had hampered the summer harvest in areas still controlled by the collaborationist government . Army Group E 's staff deemed the preceding Distomo massacre and 1 May 1944 Kaisariani executions as excessive and even damaging to the image of the occupational authorities . The staff stressed the need to arrest insurgents rather than resorting to the collective punishment of civilians . Nevertheless , those orders were disregarded and atrocities continued unhindered . Between June and August , ELAS attacks led to the death of 30 German soldiers , 14 were wounded and 9 more were missing in action . German reprisals in their turn included the execution of 254 people

		The Germans now took over the Italian zone , and soon proved to be a totally different opponent from the demoralized , war-weary and far less brutal Italians . Already since the early summer of 1943 , German troops had been pouring into Greece , fearing an Allied landing there ( in fact falling victims to a grand-scale Allied strategic deception operation , " Operation Barclay " ) . Soon they became involved in wide-ranging counterguerrilla operations , which they carried out with great ruthlessness , based on their experiences in Yugoslavia . In the course of these operations , mass reprisals were carried out , resulting in war crimes such as at Kommeno on August 16 , the Massacre of Kalavryta in December and the Massacre of Distomo in June 1944 . At the same time , hundreds of villages were systematically torched and almost one million people left homeless

		Thus , in the summer of 1943 , armed Cham collaborator units actively participated in the Nazi operations '' Augustus '' that resulted in the murder of 600 Greek villagers and the destruction of 70 villages . In September 1943 , similar Cham activity resulted in the murder of 201 civilians in the region of Paramythia and Fanari and the destruction of 19 settlements . On one occasion , the Cham administration managed to exterminate the Greek notables of Paramythia . Active collaboration was n't limited on the Greek side of the border . Thus , in January 1944 , Cham units were also active in Albania together with Nazi German forces , as a result 600 people were murdered in the region of Konispol . Though the wider Muslim Cham population was sympathetic to the Axis forces during the war , many were not active collaborators apart from those mainly recruited as Axis troops and armed irregulars

		After years of litigation , '' Basic Instinct 2 '' was released on March 31 , 2006 . A reason for a long delay in releasing the film was reportedly Stone 's dispute with the filmmakers over the nudity in the film ; she wanted more while they wanted less . A group sex scene was cut in order to achieve an R rating from the MPAA for the North American release ; the controversial scene remained in the UK version of the London-based film . Stone told an interviewer , " We are in a time of odd repression and if a popcorn movie allows us to create a platform for discussion , would n't that be great ? " . Despite an estimated budget of US$ 70 million , it placed only 10th in gross on its opening weekend with a meager US$ 3.2 million and was subsequently declared a flop . It ultimately ran in theaters for only 17 days and finished with a total domestic gross of under US$ 6 million . Stone appeared in Nick Cassavetes 's crime drama '' Alpha Dog '' ( 2006 ) , opposite Bruce Willis , playing Olivia Mazursky , the mother of a real-life murder victim ; she wore a fatsuit for the role . The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival and was an arthouse success . She made part of an ensemble cast in Emilio Estevez 's drama '' Bobby '' ( 2006 ) , about the hours leading up to the Robert F. Kennedy assassination .

Despite the film 's limited success , Roger Ebert asserted : " Hunt in particular has fun with a wisecracking dame role that owes something , perhaps , to Rosalind Russell in '' His Girl Friday '' . " In 2003 , Hunt returned to Broadway in Yasmina Reza 's '' Life x 3 '' , and in 2004 , she starred in the drama '' A Good Woman '' , as a femme fatale in 1930s NYC . '' AV Club '' , in its review for the latter , remarked : " Helen Hunt looks embarrassingly out of place trying to play an infamous seductress " . She played a socialite , as part of an ensemble cast , in Emilio Estevez 's drama '' Bobby '' ( 2006 ) , about the hours leading up to the Robert F. Kennedy assassination . As a member of the cast , she was nominated for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Cast in a Motion Picture but won the Hollywood Film Festival Award for Best Ensemble Cast . Hunt made her feature film directorial debut in '' Then She Found Me '' ( 2007 ) , in which she also starred as a 39-year-old Brooklyn elementary school teacher , who after years is contacted by the flamboyant host of a local talk show , played by Bette Midler , who introduces herself as her biological mother . After first reading Elinor Lipman 's novel , she tried to interest numerous studios in the material , and her unsuccessful efforts led her to begin writing the screenplay and raising funds to produce it herself . Upon its release , Ruthe Stein of the '' San Francisco Chronicle '' observed , " You would think that frontloading '' Then She Found Me '' with so much plot would make it play like a soap opera . But Hunt saves the movie from this fate in two ways . First she turns in a touchingly real performance , the best of her big-screen career . Forget that '' As Good as It Gets '' won her an Oscar . She 's eons better and more realistic in this one ... By directing '' Then She Found Me '' , Helen becomes its savior as well ... Hunt knows when to rein in the Divine Miss M instead of allowing her to go into full Kabuki mode . She also coaxes pitch-perfect performances from Broderick and Firth . " Hunt starred in the dramedy '' Every Day '' ( 2010 ) , as one half of a married couple pulled apart by increasing responsibilities . According to '' Los Angeles Times '' , the film " comes as a reminder of Hunt 's talent for understatement , and a wish to see more of her " . In the biographical drama '' Soul Surfer '' ( 2011 ) , she played the mother of the Hawaiian-born champion surfer Bethany Hamilton , on whose life the film was based . Her first wide release since 2001 's '' The Curse of the Jade Scorpion '' , '' Soul Surfer '' made US$ 47.1 million internationally . Hunt starred as sex surrogate Cheryl Cohen-Greene in '' The Sessions '' ( 2012 ) , alongside John Hawkes and William H. Macy . The role required Hunt to perform multiple scenes of full-frontal nudity , on which she further said : " Being naked was challenging , but even more than that was the vulnerability . I felt vulnerable because I was naked . I felt vulnerable because we were having such a vulnerable moment in this character 's life . This was a real journey that someone had gone on , and I wanted to do right by that . " Her performance was acclaimed by critics and earned her several award nominations , including an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress . Todd McCarthy of '' The Hollywood Reporter '' wrote : " Hunt 's performance may be physically bold but is equally marked by its maturity and composure . " Hunt played research geneticist Mary-Claire King in the independent drama '' Decoding Annie Parker '' ( 2013 ) , which was released to a mixed critical response . She wrote and directed the drama '' Ride '' ( 2014 ) , in which she also starred as a mother who travels cross-country to California to be with her son after he decides to drop out of school and become a surfer . Rotten Tomatoes ' critical consensus read : " '' Ride '' reaffirms Helen Hunt 's immense acting talent — but suggests that she still needs time to develop as a director . " In '' The Miracle Season '' ( 2018 ) , based on the true story of the Iowa City West High School volleyball team , Hunt played Kathy Bresnahan , a volleyball coach

		The show received a mixed reception from media publications . On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes , the show holds an approval rating of 43 % based on 30 critics , and summarized , " The 90th Academy Awards played it safe and hit no major snags -- but by clocking in at over four hours , returning host Jimmy Kimmel and company wore out their welcome long before the surprise ending . " Hank Stuever of '' The Washington Post '' marked , " In his second year , Kimmel has shown that the telecast need n't be anything but sharp and sure , with a funny host whose bits are manageable , shareable and – best of all – forgotten . We 're not making showbiz history here ; we 're just trying to get through another Oscar night . " Chief critic David Edelstein of '' Vulture '' wrote , " This was the best , most inspiring , and most sheerly likable Academy Awards telecast I 've ever seen . ... It was also – in terms of the actual awards – among the most disappointing . " '' Vanity Fair '' s , Richard Lawson wrote , " As a host , Kimmel struck a careful , appropriately measured tone ... All told , Sunday 's ceremony did an admirable job of recognizing all the turmoil surrounding it while maintaining the silly , chintzy trappings that so many of us tune into the Oscars for . " CNN 's Brian Lowry quipped , " The Oscars are a big , unwieldy beast , which invariably try to serve too many masters . Yet if the intent was ultimately to maintain a celebratory tone without ignoring either the outside world or the elephant in the room throughout this year 's awards , host Jimmy Kimmel and the show itself largely succeeded . " Others were more critical of the show . Television critic Maureen Ryan of '' Variety '' said , " All things considered , the show had a more or less low-key vibe . Normally it takes about two hours for the numbing effect to set in , but despite host Jimmy Kimmel 's best efforts , Sunday 's telecast started to feel a bit languid and low-energy far earlier . " Television critic James Poniewozik of '' The New York Times '' said , " despite the recent upheaval in Hollywood , the ceremony at large still focused mainly on celebration and glitter literally , in the case of the blinding set , which looked as if the ceremony were encased in an enormous geode . There 's also the perennial problem of bloat . The hitch , of course , is that every part of the show has its constituency . " Darren Franich of '' Entertainment Weekly '' wrote , " What fun we had at this year 's Oscars ! Long show , sure , but where to cut it ? " Writing for '' Deadline '' Greg Evans said , " Did the nearly four-hour running time contain any moments for the Oscar ages ? Probably not . " David Wiegand of the '' San Francisco Chronicle '' wrote , " Even the hope that the noise of clapping might keep the audience at home and in the theater awake , there was little of that for anything except the entrance of actors of advance age . " '' The Oregonian '' columnist Kristi Turnquist wrote , " Was it respectful ? Absolutely . Did it make for kind of a dull , earnest Oscars show ? Yeah , kind of . " Attaining 26.5 million U.S. viewers according to Nielsen ratings , the ceremony 's telecast had a 16-percent drop in viewership from last year 's ceremony and had the lowest U.S. viewership in Oscar history . On March 6 , after the final ratings were confirmed , President Donald Trump took to his Twitter account , saying , " Lowest rated Oscars in HISTORY . Problem is , we do n't have stars anymore – except your President ( just kidding , of course ) ! " . In response , Kimmel also tweeted , saying , " Thanks , lowest rated President in HISTORY .

		Some media outlets received the broadcast positively . '' St. Louis Post-Dispatch '' television critic Gail Pennington praised Stewart 's performance as host writing that he " did the Oscars proud Sunday night , turning in a four-star hosting performance that unfortunately made the rest of the show seem sluggish by comparison . " Film critic Roger Ebert said that Stewart was " on target , topical and funny , " and added , " He was as relaxed , amusing and at home as Johnny Carson . " Columnist Ray Richmond of '' The Hollywood Reporter '' commented , " He seemed at times nervous and self-conscious , but on the whole , Stewart delivered with just the right balance of reverence and smugness . " Others media publications were more critical of the show . Television critic Rob Owen of the '' Pittsburgh Post-Gazette '' wrote that Stewart was more " amusing than funny " . He added , " Many of his jokes fell flat with the stars in the Kodak Theatre , and his tendency to bow down before celebrities quickly grew tiresome . " Tom Shales from '' The Washington Post '' commented , " It 's hard to believe that professional entertainers could have put together a show less entertaining than this year 's Oscars , hosted with a smug humorlessness by comic Jon Stewart , a sad and pale shadow of great hosts gone by . " Moreover , he derided the " piles and piles and miles and miles of clips from films present and past " writing that it " squandered the visual luster " of the ceremony . Associated Press television critic Frazier Moore remarked , " Stewart , usually a very funny guy , displayed a lack of beginner 's luck as first-time host ... His usually impeccable blend of puckishness and self-effacement fell flat in the service of Oscar . " He also criticized the decision to play music over the winner 's acceptance speeches calling it " distracting and obnoxious . " The American telecast on ABC drew in an average of 38.94 million people over its length , which was an 8 % decrease from the previous year 's ceremony . Additionally , the show earned lower Nielsen ratings compared to the previous ceremony with 23.0 % of households watching over a 35 share . Furthermore , it garnered a lower 1849 demo rating with a 13.9 rating among viewers in that demographic

		The show received a negative reception from most media publications . Associated Press television critic Frazier Moore lamented that Crystal " seemed incredibly listless " . He also questioned the purpose of the " Year of the Woman " theme writing , " The Oscar show itself seemed at odds with its own feminist theme . " Robert Bianco from the '' Pittsburgh Post-Gazette '' derided Allen 's musical production numbers , comparing them to the disastrous opening number at the 61st ceremony held in 1989 . Columnist Matt Roush of '' USA Today '' complained , " Crystal , in a by-now-familiar performance , has , in four years , taken a plum assignment and , by repetition , reduced it to shtick . " He also wrote that , " The song medley is getting old hat , " and the " smug references to his flop '' Mr. Saturday Night '' were out of an improv amateur night . " The telecast also received unfavorable reaction from various public feminist figures . In an interview with '' Los Angeles Daily News '' author and activist Betty Friedan condemned the " Year of the Woman " theme commenting , " It had no basis in reality . On behalf of women directors , cinematographer , and producers , I resent the travesty of calling that a tribute . " Likewise , President of the National Organization for Women 's Los Angeles chapter Tammy Bruce chastised ceremony 's feminist tribute as " one of the most hypocritical , patronizing things I saw in my whole life . " In response , Gil Cates responded towards the criticism of the theme stating , " The theme developed and raised consciousness in a way that I think is positive , not only for the individual in general but for individual women specifically . " He also quoted an ancient Chinese proverb later made famous by former U.S. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt saying , " It is better to light one candle than to curse the darkness " Despite the adverse reception , the ABC broadcast drew in an average of 45.7 million people over its length , which was a 3 % increase from the previous year 's ceremony . The show also drew higher Nielsen ratings compared to the previous ceremony with 31.2 % of households watching over a 51 share . It also drew a higher 18 – 49 demo rating with a 20.1 rating among viewers in that demographic

Nine vice presidents and five secretaries were then elected . The convention nominated Bissell for governor with Francis Hoffmann as lieutenant governor , Ozias M. Hatch for secretary of state , Jesse K. Dubois as auditor , and James Miller as treasurer . Hoffmann was found to be ineligible for his position due to a residency requirement , and John Wood was nominated in his place . The following resolutions defining the party platform were approved : Resolved , That foregoing all former differences of opinions upon other questions , we pledge ourselves to unite in opposition to the present administration and to the party which upholds and supports it and to use all honorable and constitutional means to wrest the Government from the unworthy hands which now control it and to bring it back in its administration to the principles and practices of Washington , Jefferson and their great and good compatriots of the Revolution . Resolved , That foregoing all former differences of opinions upon other questions , we pledge ourselves to unite in opposition to the present administration of the Government ; that under the Constitution Congress possesses the power to prohibit slavery in the Territories ; and that , whilst we will maintain all constitutional rights of the South , we also hold that justice , humanity , the principles of freedom as expressed in our Declaration of Independence and our national constitution , and the purity and perpetuity of our Government require that that power shall be exerted to prevent the extension of slavery into territory heretofore free . Resolved , That the repeal of the Missouri Compromise was unwise and injurious ; an open and aggravated violation of the plighted faith of the States , and that the attempt of the present administration to force slavery into Kansas against the known wishes of the legal voters of that Territory is an arbitrary and tyrannous violation of the rights of the people to govern themselves , and that we will strive by all constitutional means to secure to Kansas and Nebraska the legal guaranty against slavery of which they were deprived at the cost of the violation of the plighted faith of the nation . Resolved , That we are devoted to the Union and will , to the last extremity , defend it against the efforts now being made by the dis-unionists of this administration to compass its dissolution , and that we will support the Constitution of the United States , in all its provisions regarding it , as the sacred bond of our Union and the only safeguard for the preservation of the rights of ourselves and our posterity . Resolved , That we are in favor of the immediate admission of Kansas as a member of this Confederacy under the constitution adopted by the people of said Territory . Resolved , That the spirit of our institutions as well as the Constitution of our country , guarantees the liberty of conscience as well as political freedom , and that we will proscribe no one by legislation or otherwise on account of religious opinions , or in consequence of place of birth . Lincoln delivered the closing address . The speech was purportedly so captivating that no reporter made a record of it . The address has become known as Lincoln 's Lost Speech . The delegates to the convention were : The Democrats had nominated Richardson for governor at their convention earlier that month . The remnants of the Whig party declined to run a candidate . The first Republican National Convention met that June , nominating John C. Fremont for president . Fremont was defeated handily in his bid for president , including in Illinois , but the Republican state ticket in Illinois was successful . Bissell became the first Governor from a party other than the Democrats since 1838 . Republicans would win every subsequent gubernatorial election through 1893

		These events followed the Democratic Convention earlier that month , during which James M. Cox was nominated for president and Franklin D. Roosevelt was nominated for vice president . Upon hearing of Bryan 's nomination by the Prohibition Party , Cox 's aides scrambled to encourage Bryan to decline , fearing potential Cox supporters may favor Bryan instead . Further , it was not yet certain whether Bryan would publicly declare his support for Cox . Democratic strategists acknowledged that if Bryan threatened to accept the Prohibition nomination , it would pressure Cox to declare support of the prohibition platform . Ultimately , however , Bryan declined the nomination , perhaps because after he had lost three times on a major party ticket , he feared losing a fourth time on a minor party ticket

		Roosevelt attended the 1884 GOP National Convention in Chicago and gave a speech convincing delegates to nominate African American John R. Lynch , an Edmunds supporter , to be temporary chair . Roosevelt fought alongside the Mugwump reformers ; however , Blaine , having gained support from Arthur 's and Edmunds 's delegates , won the nomination by 541 votes on the fourth ballot . In a crucial moment of his budding political career , Roosevelt resisted the demand of the Mugwumps that he bolt from Blaine . He bragged about his one small success : " We achieved a victory in getting up a combination to beat the Blaine nominee for temporary chairman ... To do this needed a mixture of skill , boldness and energy ... to get the different factions to come in ... to defeat the common foe . " He was also impressed by an invitation to speak before an audience of ten thousand , the largest crowd he had addressed up to that date . Having gotten a taste of national politics , Roosevelt felt less aspiration for advocacy on the state level ; he then retired to his new " Chimney Butte Ranch " on the Little Missouri River . Roosevelt refused to join other Mugwumps in supporting Grover Cleveland , the governor of New York and the Democratic nominee in the general election . He debated the pros and cons of staying loyal with his political friend , Henry Cabot Lodge . After Blaine won the nomination , Roosevelt had carelessly said that he would give " hearty support to any decent Democrat " . He distanced himself from the promise , saying that it had not been meant " for publication " . When a reporter asked if he would support Blaine , Roosevelt replied , " That question I decline to answer . It is a subject I do not care to talk about . " In the end , he realized that he had to support Blaine to maintain his role in the GOP , and he did so in a press release on July 19 . Having lost the support of many reformers , Roosevelt decided to retire from politics and move to North Dakota

		The album was tentatively due to be released in May 2012 , but was later announced with an official release date of December 4 , 2012 . It was originally expected to be released near the end of 2011 but the delay between albums was because Kesha wanted to try to make an album that could shift the sound of pop music into a more rock direction . While being interviewed by the '' Calgary Herald '' she explained the delay and elaborated on this , stating : " I want to take enough time to make sure it 's the reinvention of pop music . That 's the ultimate goal , to reinvent pop music . So I 'm planning on taking as much time as I need , but May sounds about right . " In the summer of 2013 , Kesha embarked on a co-headlined tour with Pitbull . The tour , North American Tour 2013 , travelled across North America , hitting venues in the United States and Canada . Since the joint tour did not cover any places outside of the US and Canada , Kesha decided to extend her tour and add more dates in other countries . The Warrior Tour covers many places in Europe , venues throughout the US , and select places in Asia . Many of the dates are parts of festivals and fairs such as Live at the Marquee Festival in Cork , Ireland , the Wireless Festival in London , England , and the Illinois State Fair in Springfield , Illinois . Before the main tour , Kesha performed many promotional tour dates throughout late 2012 and early 2013 . Those dates include stadium and TV concerts in Europe , America , Australia , and Asia in August , October , and November 2012 , music festival performances in America in December 2012 , more TV concerts , special music festival performances , and normal concerts in January , and February 2013 in Asia and America .

		, also Disposition of the Ryūkyūs , dispositions relating to the Ryūkyūs , or Annexation of Okinawa , was the political process during the early years of the Meiji period that saw the incorporation of the former Ryūkyū Kingdom into the Empire of Japan as Okinawa Prefecture ( i.e. , one of Japan 's " home " prefectures ) and its decoupling from the Chinese tributary system . [ 10 ] These processes began with the creation of Ryūkyū Domain in 1872 and culminated in the kingdom 's annexation and final dissolution in 1879 ; immediate diplomatic fallout and consequent negotiations with Qing China , brokered by Ulysses S. Grant , effectively came to an end late the following year . [ 11 ] The term is also sometimes used more narrowly in relation to the events and changes of 1879 alone . [ 12 ] The Ryūkyū Disposition has been " alternatively characterized as aggression , annexation , national unification , or internal reform " .

For centuries , Japan viewed the Ryukyu Islands as one of its provinces . In 1871 the Mudan incident happened : cannibal Taiwanese aborigines murdered 54 Ryūkyūan sailors that had their ship shipwrecked . At that time the Ryukyu Islands were claimed by both Qing China and Japan , and the Japanese interpreted the incident as an attack on their citizens . They took steps to bring the islands in their jurisdiction : in 1872 the Japanese Ryukyu Domain was declared , and in 1874 a retaliatory incursion to Taiwan was sent , which was a success . The success of this expedition emboldened the Japanese : not even the Americans could defeat the Taiwanese cannibals in the Formosa Expedition of 1867 . Very few gave it much thought at the time , but this was the first move in the Japanese expansionism series . Japan occupied Taiwan for the rest of 1874 and then left owing to Chinese pressures , but in 1879 it finally annexed the Ryukyu Islands . In 1875 Qing China sent a 300-men force to subdue the Taiwanese cannibals , but unlike the Japanese the Chinese were routed , ambushed and 250 of their men were killed ; the failure of this expedition exposed once more the failure of Qing China to exert effective control in Taiwan , and acted as another incentive for the Japanese to annex Taiwan .

		During June 1989 , at least fifteen major airlines showed edited versions of '' Rain Man '' that omitted a scene involving Raymond 's refusal to fly , mentioning the crashes of American Airlines Flight 625 , Delta Air Lines Flight 191 , and Continental Airlines Flight 1713 , except on Australia-based Qantas . Those criticizing this move included film director Barry Levinson , co-screenwriter Ronald Bass , and George Kirgo ( at the time the President of the Writers Guild of America , West ) . " I think it 's a key scene to the entire movie , " Levinson said in a telephone interview . " That 's why it 's in there . It launches their entire odyssey across country – because they could n't fly . " While some of those airlines cited as justification avoiding having airplane passengers feel uncomfortable in sympathy with Raymond during the in-flight entertainment , the scene was shown intact on flights of Qantas , and commentators noted that Raymond mentions '' it '' as the only airline whose planes have " never crashed " . The film is credited with introducing Qantas ' safety record to U.S. consumers

		" I remember reading about how The Beatles stopped playing live , because everyone just screamed though all the shows " , noted Jon Bon Jovi . " Musicianship and song quality meant so little to the fans that the band just felt undervalued . You know what ? I understand what they mean . It got so bad when we toured for '' Slippery When Wet '' that there were times I was freaking out … We indulged in everything that was on offer . But it was n't real , and what I wanted above all else was to be given credit for the work I put into the songs and into the recording … The problem was that I did n't notice how the image overtook what we were about . " Of the omission of recordings from this tour from '' One Wild Night Live 1985 – 2001 '' , Jon Bon Jovi remarked : " It makes sense for the '' Slippery '' tour not to be represented , because at that time I was dosed up on cortisone and my voice was shot . Back then , it was n't much of a voice . " Cinderella supported at the majority of shows on the North American leg of the tour . In mainland Europe , Queensrÿche was the support . For the UK leg , support came from the British band FM on all dates except for the last three for which Queensrÿche was the support act

		Michael Cohl is a Canadian concert promoter , theatrical producer and touring impresario . He is the former Chairman of Live Nation . Cohl now runs S2BN Entertainment , with offices in New York and Toronto . Having been named the Howard Hughes of rock ‘ n ’ roll by '' Fortune '' magazine , Cohl is most famous for having overseen the tours and related ancillary businesses for more than 150 artists , including Frank Sinatra , Michael Jackson , The Rolling Stones , Prince , Stevie Wonder , Pink Floyd , Crosby , Stills , Nash and Young and U2 . He has also been credited with developing the concept of " package " touring . Eliminating the middleman , Cohl worked directly with the artist to strategize and route the tour , promote the dates , and assist in the development and exploitation of the lucrative aftermarket – books , films , DVDs , television specials , and merchandising . He is currently the lead producer of '' Spider-Man : Turn Off the Dark '' , the most expensive musical in Broadway history , with music by Bono and The Edge of U2 . In December 1995 , The Toronto Star printed a 4,000 word article entitled " King Cohl of Rock 'n' Roll and the Tax That Never Was . " From conversations with a number of managers of touring bands , the reporter argued that Cohl 's Concert Productions International misrepresented to touring artists that it was collecting a tax , while not remitting any such tax to any government body . The tax was a phoney tax Cohl added onto every ticket he sold at Toronto 's CNE Stadium . Fans paid an extra $ 3 per ticket for Springsteen , U2 , and Stones tickets . According to Canadian government auditors , that $ 3 per ticket added up to $ 5 million , all of which was pocketed by Cohl . He avoided jail time but had to sell back his BCL Entertainment Ltd stock to Labatt 's . Cohl was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame , when he received a Walt Grealis Special Achievement Award at the 2002 Juno Awards . Cohl is also a recipient of the 2004 Billboard Legend of Live award , an honour previously bestowed on such artists as Elton John and The Allman Brothers Band . When '' Spamalot '' won the 2005 Drama Desk and Tony Award for Best Musical , Cohl was among the producers who received the awards . He was inducted in Canada 's Walk of Fame in 2005 Cohl has produced several Broadway musicals as well as numerous other international touring shows . These include : CBC Television released a 2006 documentary directed by acclaimed filmmaker Barry Avrich as part of the '' Life and Times '' series chronicling Cohl 's rise to prominence in the entertainment industry . The film claims " When the Rolling Stones wo n’t make a move without talking to you first , your name must be Michael Cohl . " Mick Jagger , Keith Richards and Bono all make appearances

She was owned by the Fort George Lake and River Transportation Company , a partnership of George Hammond and his brother . She was launched at the Central Fort George town - site of Fort George on May 22 , 1913 . She was built so that George Hammond , the promoter of Central Fort George , could claim that his community had steamer service . Central Fort George was on the Nechako River and the large sternwheelers owned by the BC Express Company , despite a $ 50 per trip inducement , could rarely call there , as there often were sandbars unless the water was very high . The rival sternwheelers of the South Fort George town - site owned by the Fort George Lumber and Navigation Company were not interested in helping George Hammond promote Central . In 1913 , the Robert C Hammond made several trips on the Nechako as well as working on the route from Soda Creek to Fort George . For one auspicious moment in her short career , she was going to be a Royal Mail Ship for the newly formed Imperial Express Company which had been formed by Mayor JT Robinson of Kamloops and JC Shields of Vancouver , which had won the government mail contract from the BC Express Company .

In accordance to this time period , Chile ’s imports fell from US $ 197m in 1929 to US $ 26m in 1932 ( Thorp 1984 , p. 333 ) . Similarly , real GDP dropped from 100 in 1929 to 67 in 1932 , contributed by the fall of the value of production from 100 in 1929 to 77 in 1932 alongside a rapid decrease in the average annual production that reached the equivalent to one quarter of 1929 levels in December of 1932 . Alongside a decrease in employment in the mining sector , in terms of GDP and productive activity , mining dropped to 26.3 in 1932 from 1929 levels of 100 .

		The film premiered at the Panorama section of the 2019 Berlin International Film Festival . Its official premiere took place at the Zoo Palast , and was presented by Michael Stultz . New Europe Film Sales announced its theatrical release in a series of territories ( Germany , Greece , Poland , Korea , Sweden , etc. ) , and the film continued its festival outings with participations at the 2019 BiFan - Bucheon Fantastic International Film Festival ( Asian premiere ) , the Beaune International Thriller Festival , the Istanbul Film Festival , the Transylvania International Film Festival , etc . After its premiere in Berlinale , the Guardian 's film critic Peter Bradshaw gave the film a 3/5 star review , calling it " A Lynchian psychodrama in the sun " and " a disquieting spectacle of strangeness " . The Hollywood Reporter and Screen International praised the film for its direction , imagery and the committed performances of Angeliki Papoulia and Youla Boudali , while criticising elements of the script 's narrative construction and pace . Guy Lodge in Variety wrote that " “ '' A Blast '' director Syllas Tzoumerkas returns with an agitated , atmospheric and sometimes confounding exercise in modern Greek tragedy . Tzoumerkas ’ latest invites comparisons to the loopier , trash-skirting genre outings of Herzog or Lynch , with the gradual unpeeling of layered madness and corruption in the sleepy working town of Missolonghi occasionally calling to mind an aggressively sunburned '' Twin Peaks '' " . Savina Petkova of the Electric Ghost gave the film 5/5 stars , writing that " while the film is saturated with Biblical quotes , icons of saints , and church choir songs , its form attends equally to the lowly human , animal , and nature . Pacifying all forms of life under the flag of future deliverance , the promise that each being will attain their most perfect form and self , '' The Miracle of the Sargasso Sea '' provides a convergence between religious submission and humanistic agency . ” Victoria Ferguson in the Upcoming gave the film a 3/5 review praising the cinematography by Petrus Sjövik and " its close shots that capture the inner angst of the characters " and calling '' The Miracle of the Sargasso Sea '' visually compelling , and ' a show of great creative ambition from Tzoumerkas . ” Italian critic Massimo Lechi wrote in '' Il Ragazzo Selvaggio '' magazine that “ '' The Miracle of the Sargasso Sea '' , set in the inhospitable surroundings of a sun-parched Missolonghi , is a metaphysical thriller loaded with biblical references , an unsettling and disturbing meditation on the concept of paradise featuring two women in profound existential crisis : Elisabeth , ( a master Angeliki Papoulia ) a disgraced policewoman confined in the province by her superiors following an unfortunate anti-terrorist operation ; and Rita ( the brave Youla Boudali , also co-screenwriter ) , a painful figure of a martyr besieged by visions of a mystical background . Tzoumerkas ’ cinema is one that ’s not afraid of risk or ridicule , one which in fact , has the clear intent of forcing the limits of both the police genre and the auteur film genre , seducing with the skill of its performers and its disquieting aesthetic choices that are never banal . After '' Homeland '' ( 2010 ) and '' A Blast '' ( 2014 ) , '' The Miracle of the Sargasso '' is the third – and more complex – chapter of Tzoumerkas ’ ideal trilogy on contemporary Greece . ” '' The Miracle of the Sargasso Sea '' and Syllas Tzoumerkas were nominated for the Panorama Audience Award and the Teddy Award at the 69th Berlin International Film Festival
