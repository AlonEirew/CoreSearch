		CONTEXT=In a May 2005 column in the '' Weekly Standard '' , Daveed Gartenstein-Ross wrote about his May 14 , 2005 , debate with Bray on PAX-TV 's Faith Under Fire program . He noted that a '' Chicago Tribune '' article had detailed how the fundamentalist Islamist Muslim Brotherhood operates in the US through MAS , and that MAS wants to see the US governed by sharia law . He noted that MAS , " except in its most public of statements " , was open about its agenda . He argued that while Bray " tries to portray MAS as an organization that embraces these shared liberal democratic values , the group simultaneously teaches its members that all government should become Islamic and that non-Islamic judicial systems should be boycotted . " In July 2005 , after the London bombings that killed 52 people , Bray said : " Let me say to the terrorists very clearly , that you will have no comfort in our community . Our community offers you no harbor . Our message is clear , you do no service to Islam , you do a great disservice to Islam and for the love of God , stop this madness . " When the '' Philadelphia Inquirer '' published some of the cartoons of Mohammed in the 2005 Mohammed cartoons controversy , Bray said : " This has nothing to do with free speech ; its pure sensationalism that reeks of religious disrespect . What the '' Philadelphia Inquirer '' has done is irresponsible , provocative , and reckless . " When in November 2006 , two imams from Boston-area mosques were arrested and charged with being involved in a scheme that secured religious worker visas for immigrants who instead got secular jobs , Bray said : " If this was sic clerics who were anything other than Muslims , would they have had to face this ? " After the September 2007 resignation of Esam Omeish from a Virginia Commission on Immigration , after it was revealed that he had publicly endorsed " the jihad way " in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict , Bray said " What 's the big news ? Everybody knows Muslims feel passionately about the Palestinian issue . What in the world is wrong about talking about the invasion of Lebanon or the plight of the Palestinian people ?

QUERY_CONTEXT=In the 1959 review for '' Sight & Sound '' , David Vaughan calls '' Gigi '' " an elegant film " with a " cultivated visual taste which is everywhere apparent " . He summarises that " while '' Gigi '' does not represent a revival of the MGM musical in its heyday , it is a welcome extension of latter-day musical style in its adult subject-matter and its avoidance of spectacle made vulgar by emphasis on size . " He praises Minnelli 's talent for " the delicious amorality of the anecdote , but also the honesty and irony of its telling which have become foreign to the American cinema . " Vaughan points out " Chevalier 's practiced but irresistible charm as one of the film 's greatest assets " as well as " the brilliant high-comedy playing of Isabel Jeans , who as Aunt Alicia consummately portrays the distinction and beauty of a retired aristocrat of the '' demimonde '' . " Bosley Crowther of '' The New York Times '' called it " a musical film that bears such a basic resemblance to '' My Fair Lady '' that the authors may want to sue themselves " . He added , " But do n't think this point of resemblance is made in criticism of the film , for '' Gigi '' is a charming entertainment that can stand on its own two legs . It is not only a charming comprehension of the spicy confection of Colette , but it is also a lovely and lyrical enlargement upon that story 's flavored mood and atmosphere … Vincente Minnelli has marshaled a cast to give a set of performances that , for quality and harmony , are superb . " Abel Green of '' Variety '' called the film " 100 % escapist fare " and predicted it " is destined for a global box-office mop-up " . He added , " Alan Jay Lerner 's libretto is tailor-made for an inspired casting job for all principals , and Fritz Loewe 's tunes ( to Lerner 's lyrics ) already vie with and suggest their memorable '' My Fair Lady '' score … Miss Caron is completely captivating and convincing in the title role … Skillful casting , performance and presentation have endowed realism to the sum total … Director Minnelli 's good taste in keeping it in bounds and the general sound judgment of all concerned … distinguishes this Arthur Freed independent production . The Metrocolor rates recognition for its soft pastels under Joseph Ruttenberg 's lensing ; the Beaton costumes , sets and general production design are vivid physical assets at first sight . The skillful integration of words-and-music with the plot motivation makes this '' Gigi '' a very fair lady indeed as a boxoffice entry . " '' Time Out New York '' said , " The dominating creative contribution comes from Minnelli and Cecil Beaton … The combination of these two visual elitists is really too much — it 's like a meal consisting of cheesecake , and one quickly longs for something solid and vulgar to weigh things down . No doubt inspired by the finicky , claustrophobic sets and bric-à-brac , the cast tries ( with unfortunate success ) to be more French than the French , especially Chevalier . The exception is Gingold , who inhabits , as always , a world of her own . " '' TV Guide '' rated the film 3 ½ out of five stars , calling it " Overbaked but enjoyable , and a banquet for the eyes , thanks to the visual wonder of the Minnelli-Beaton teaming … Caron … leads the cast in a contest to see who can be the most French . The winner is Chevalier , in a performance that makes one feel as if you 're gagging on pastry … Perhaps if the sweetness of '' Gigi '' was contrasted with elements of honest vulgarity , the picture could balance itself out … Ten minutes into the movie , you 've resolved the plot and are left to wallow in lovely frou-frou . The film makes wonderful use of the usual Parisian landmarks , and benefits from extraordinary period costumes and sets . " '' Gigi '' won a record-breaking nine Academy Awards ( at the 1959 Oscars ceremony ) ; however , this record only lasted for one year , as '' Ben-Hur '' broke this record the following year with 11 Oscars . In tribute to '' Gigi '' s domination of the Oscars , the MGM switchboard answered calls the following day with " M-Gigi-M " . '' Gigi '' , eventually along with 1987 's '' The Last Emperor '' , held the record as the film ( s ) with the most Academy Award wins in every category in which it was nominated , until 2003 's '' The Lord of the Rings : The Return of the King '' broke the record at the 2004 Oscars ceremony with 11 Oscar nominations and 11 Oscar wins

But its charm never quite wears off , for reasons summed up in the title . " Actress Angourie Rice had similar sentiments , writing in an essay that “ it was such a fascinating experience to witness the actors ’ performances turned into van Gogh style paintings . The great thing about this film is that it also made me question what the merging of artforms meant for art , film , and everything in between . ” Giuseppe Sedia of the '' Krakow Post '' praised the impressive visual style of the movie . However , he added , " In their concern to keep the viewers interested , directors Kobiela and Welchman have built an over-narrated and spirit-dampening movie in which the preponderance of the dialogues hinders the viewers ’ immersion into the violent beauty and materiality of Van Gogh ’s oeuvre " .

		CONTEXT=He arrived at the club as an incredibly shy and underdeveloped personality , a fact that was noted by teammate Trent Cotchin who said though Martin was 18 “ he seemed much younger in some of the ways he behaved . ” Indeed , he struggled initially to adjust to the expectations of professional football . In one incident in the 2010 preseason he was removed from training and verbally reprimanded by club leadership when he was deemed unfit to train after a big night out . Despite these struggles , his on-field development was such that he would still debut in the 2010 season 's opening match , a 56-point Richmond loss against at the MCG . Martin recorded the sixth most disposals of any Tiger ( 18 ) to go along with four marks , three tackles and three clearances . Two weeks later Martin was convicted by the AFL tribunal for a high hit on Sydney 's Josh Kennedy in round 3 . He did not receive a suspension for the incident however , returning to football the following week . After four matches Martin ranked fourth in the league for clearances and eighth for hard-ball gets . Media reports emerged after round 8 that the 18 year old Martin had received a significant contract offer from expansion club the Greater Western Sydney Giants . The offer , which the Herald Sun ’s Mark Robinson claimed to be worth $ 2.4 million over three seasons , would have taken effect in the new club 's first AFL season in 2012 . Martin later said he had never entertained the idea of moving to the start-up club . In round 10 he had gained attention for his on-field efforts again , this time being nominated for the 2010 AFL Rising Star award after a 21 disposal and 11 clearance match against Port Adelaide . Due to his previous tribunal conviction however , Martin was ruled ineligible for the award and thus did not officially place in the end of season award 's points tally . He drew the attention of Sydney coach Paul Roos by round 14 , prompting Roos to send veteran Brett Kirk onto Martin in a tagging role . Despite this extra attention , he still managed to record 18 disposals and a goal in the match at the MCG . After 17 rounds Martin ranked second at the club for clearances and inside 50s as well as third for disposals and contested possessions . At the same time he ranked first among that season 's Rising Star nominees in clearances , contested possessions and inside 50s . He was also fourth for average disposals and fifth for average tackles . In round 19 he was rested by the club before returning to play out the final five matches of the season . He missed just that one game in his debut season and finished the year ranked second at Richmond for clearances and inside 50s , as well as third for both contested possessions and disposals . In addition to winning the Fred Swift Medal for fourth place at the club 's best and fairest night , Martin also received six votes in the Brownlow Medal count that year , the most by any Richmond debutant since Craig Lambert in 1988 . At season 's end he reiterated his commitment to the club ( and rejection of the former GWS overtures ) by signing a two-year contract extension that would keep him at Richmond until the end of the 2013 season . The extension was reported by the Herald Sun to be in the vicinity of $ 400,000-a-year

QUERY_CONTEXT=" Motivation " is a R&B slow jam song written by Richard Butler ( Rico Love ) , Jim Jonsin , Dwayne Carter and Danny Morris . The racy lyrics center around Rowland asking her man to use his hands all over her body , and are accompanied by a " synth-saturated beat " produced by Jonsin . In terms of instruments , " Motivation " uses sparse keyboard notes , programmed beats and pulsing synths in the chorus . Wayne adds a rap verse complementing Rowland 's seductive suggestions , using the kitchen and a car as metaphors for sex . According to Scott Shetler from AOL Music , Rowland uses the lyrics to promise " to be her lover 's motivation . " Rowland called the record a mixture between dance and mash-up . When asked by MTV what Rowland thought of the song , she said , " It has that personality and characteristic to it that I do n't think anybody can deny . That 's why when Wayne dropped that insane verse on there ... I was like , ' You really brought that up even more . ' He went into the studio and just did it . I do n't think it takes much for Wayne to think . He just does it . He 's so admirable . " Ryan Brockington , from the '' New York Post , '' was amongst the first to review " Motivation . " In his review , he said " The single is a big leap from the dance club synth pop that Kelly has been releasing the past year and it seems like she might be trying to shimmy her way back into the hip-hop world by teaming up with the Midas touch vocals of Lil Wayne . " Both '' Rap-Up '' and AOL Music 's Scott Shetler called the song " sexy . " Becky Bain from Idolator disliked the song for not being memorable . The short review was summed up with the closing phrase , " she ’s going to need another hit to help promote her album when it finally is ready to drop . " Wesley Case from '' The Baltimore Sun '' complemented the song 's sexy quality . " If this is n't the year 's hands-down sexiest song thus far , it has to be in the discussion . Rowland , whose sultry voice could get a priest hot , weaving in and out of the minimal beat , and setting the table for Lil Wayne 's stuttering , after-hours guest-verse . Stack the pieces together and it 's an understated knockout that gets sexier with each spin . " Billboard ranked it number five on their " Critics ' Picks : 20 Best Songs of 2011 " " Motivation " was nominated for two awards at the 2011 Soul Train Music Awards including Best Dance Performance and Song of the Year.It won the award for Song of the Year and was also nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration at the 54th Grammy Awards , which was held on February 12 , 2012

QUERY_ANSWERS={'were massacred', 'Mudan incident'}
QUERY_CONTEXT=And Japan was eager to take every opportunity . In 1869 they took advantage of the defeat of the rebels of the Republic of Ezo to incorporate definitely the island of Hokkaido to Japan . For centuries , Japan viewed the Ryukyu Islands as one of its provinces . In 1871 the Mudan incident happened : cannibal Taiwanese aborigines murdered 54 Ryūkyūan sailors that had their ship shipwrecked . At that time the Ryukyu Islands were claimed by both Qing China and Japan , and the Japanese interpreted the incident as an attack on their citizens . They took steps to bring the islands in their jurisdiction : in 1872 the Japanese Ryukyu Domain was declared , and in 1874 a retaliatory incursion to Taiwan was sent , which was a success . The success of this expedition emboldened the Japanese : not even the Americans could defeat the Taiwanese cannibals in the Formosa Expedition of 1867 . Very few gave it much thought at the time , but this was the first move in the Japanese expansionism series . Japan occupied Taiwan for the rest of 1874 and then left owing to Chinese pressures , but in 1879 it finally annexed the Ryukyu Islands . In 1875 Qing China sent a 300-men force to subdue the Taiwanese cannibals , but unlike the Japanese the Chinese were routed , ambushed and 250 of their men were killed ; the failure of this expedition exposed once more the failure of Qing China to exert effective control in Taiwan , and acted as another incentive for the Japanese to annex Taiwan . Eventually , the spoils for winning the First Sino-Japanese War in 1894 included Taiwan

		ANSWER=British Airways Flight 38 accident
		GOLD_MENTION=British Airways Flight 38
		CONTEXT=It is very important that jet fuel be free from water contamination . During flight , the temperature of the fuel in the tanks decreases , due to the low temperatures in the upper atmosphere . This causes precipitation of the dissolved water from the fuel . The separated water then drops to the bottom of the tank , because it is more dense than the fuel . Since the water is no longer in solution , it can form droplets which can supercool to below 0 °C . If these supercooled droplets collide with a surface they can freeze and may result in blocked fuel inlet pipes . This was the cause of the British Airways Flight 38 accident . Removing all water from fuel is impractical ; therefore , fuel heaters are usually used on commercial aircraft to prevent water in fuel from freezing

It 's kind of exciting . " Writing in the '' Los Angeles Times '' , journalist Erin Aubry Kaplan noted the difference between Tarantino 's '' Jackie Brown '' and '' Django Unchained '' : " It is an institution whose horrors need no exaggerating , yet '' Django '' does exactly that , either to enlighten or entertain . A white director slinging around the n-word in a homage to '70s blaxploitation à la '' Jackie Brown '' is one thing , but the same director turning the savageness of slavery into pulp fiction is quite another . " While hosting NBC 's '' Saturday Night Live '' , Jamie Foxx joked about being excited " to kill all the white people in the movie " . Conservative columnist Jeff Kuhner wrote a reaction to the '' SNL '' skit for '' The Washington Times '' , saying : " Anti-white bigotry has become embedded in our postmodern culture . Take '' Django Unchained '' . The movie boils down to one central theme : the white man as devil — a moral scourge who must be eradicated like a lethal virus . " Samuel L. Jackson told Vogue Man that " '' Django Unchained '' was a harder and more detailed exploration of what the slavery experience was than '' 12 Years a Slave '' , but director Steve McQueen is an artist and since he 's respected for making supposedly art films , it 's held in higher esteem than '' Django '' , because that was basically a blaxploitation movie . " Some reviews criticized the film for being too violent . The originally planned premiere of '' Django '' was postponed following the Sandy Hook school shooting on December 14 , 2012 . Thomas Frank criticized the film 's use of violence as follows : Not surprisingly , Quentin Tarantino has lately become the focus for this sort of criticism ( about the relationship between the movies and acts of violence ) . The fact that '' Django Unchained '' arrived in theaters right around the time of the Sandy Hook massacre did n't help . Yet he has refused to give an inch in discussing the link between movie violence and real life . Obviously I do n't think one has to do with the other . Movies are about make-believe . It 's about imagination . Part of the thing is trying to create a realistic experience , but we are faking it . Is it possible that anyone in our cynical world credits a self-serving sophistry like this ? Of course an industry under fire will claim that its hands are clean , just as the NRA has done – and of course a favorite son , be it Tarantino or LaPierre , can be counted on to make the claim louder than anyone else . But do they really believe that imaginative expression is without consequence ? '' The Independent '' said the movie was part of " the new sadism in cinema " and added , " There is something disconcerting about sitting in a crowded cinema as an audience guffaws at the latest garroting or falls about in hysterics as someone is beheaded or has a limb lopped off "

		CONTEXT='' In Through the Out Door '' divided contemporary critics and Led Zeppelin fans ; some found its synthesizer-influenced music inevitable but forward-thinking while others felt the band had forsaken their heavy , fast sound . According to Jimmy Page biographer Martin Power , " predictably , in the wake of punk , '' In Through the Out Door '' received a rough ride from some critics , with Zep 's veteran status in the music business now used as a stick with which to beat them . " Reviewing the album in '' Rolling Stone '' , Charles M. Young said Page 's diminishing creativity resulted in little good material to work with for Plant , whose lyrics Young found inane , and Bonham , whose drumming was viewed as heavy handed . This brought to the forefront the keyboard playing of Jones , who Young said " functions best behind Page , not in front of him " . Chris Bohn from '' Melody Maker '' said " the impressionable first play " of the record " had everyone in the office rolling around laughing " , while accusing the band of being " totally out of touch " and " displaying the first intimations of mortality " . By contrast , '' NME '' journalist Nick Kent argued that the album was " no epitaph " , believing its " potential points of departure " deserved further listening . Robert Christgau also wrote positively of the record in '' The Village Voice '' , observing the usual " lax in the lyrics department " , but regarding the album as the group 's best since '' Houses of the Holy '' ( 1973 ) . He said " the tuneful synthesizer pomp on side two confirms my long-held belief that this is a real good art-rock band " , while " the lollapalooza hooks on the first side confirms the world 's long-held belief that this is a real good hard rock band " . At the end of the year , '' In Through the Out Door '' was nominated for the 1980 American Music Awards , in the category of " Favorite Pop/Rock Album "

He played his Rickenbacker bass , a Tobias four-string bass , a custom made Mouradian bass , and Rabin 's Casio computer guitar that was run through a synthesiser . Early into the production of '' Talk '' , White said an initial 5.5 GB of space was insufficient due to the estimated 27 microphones used to record his drumming in real time and the decision to use more tracks for the drums in the final mix as opposed to condensing them . Until that point , each song was roughly 350 MB in size . In its unedited form , the album took up over 34 GB of memory . Production was delayed for a short while following the Northridge , California earthquake on 17 January 1994 to protect the equipment from damage caused by subsequent tremors .
