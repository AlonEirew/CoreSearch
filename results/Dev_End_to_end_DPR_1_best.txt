The narrowness of the valleys and encroachment of buildings on the river banks contributed to record flooding . By the time nightfall came one-third of the city was under of water and by the time flooding was over twenty-five people lost their lives . The damages , estimated at $ 43 million , made it the worst flood since the flood of 1889 and the event is chronicled at the Johnstown Flood Museum After the flood , sweeping nationwide flood control laws were enacted and from 1938 to 1943 Johnstown saw many projects completed .

QUERY_CONTEXT=Since the early 2000s , Sinai has been the site of several terror attacks against tourists , the majority of whom are Egyptian . Investigations have shown that these were mainly motivated by a resentment of the poverty faced by many Bedouin in the area . Attacking the tourist industry was viewed as a method of damaging the industry so that the government would pay more attention to their situation . ( See 2004 Sinai bombings , 2005 Sharm El Sheikh bombings and 2006 Dahab bombings ) . Since the 2011 Egyptian Revolution , unrest has become more prevalent in the area including the 2012 Egyptian-Israeli border attack in which 16 Egyptian soldiers were killed by militants . ( See Sinai insurgency . ) Also on the rise are kidnappings of refugees . According to Meron Estifanos , Eritrean refugees are often kidnapped by Bedouin in the northern Sinai , tortured , raped , and only released after receiving a large ransom

QUERY_CONTEXT=In the 1959 review for '' Sight & Sound '' , David Vaughan calls '' Gigi '' " an elegant film " with a " cultivated visual taste which is everywhere apparent " . He summarises that " while '' Gigi '' does not represent a revival of the MGM musical in its heyday , it is a welcome extension of latter-day musical style in its adult subject-matter and its avoidance of spectacle made vulgar by emphasis on size . " He praises Minnelli 's talent for " the delicious amorality of the anecdote , but also the honesty and irony of its telling which have become foreign to the American cinema . " Vaughan points out " Chevalier 's practiced but irresistible charm as one of the film 's greatest assets " as well as " the brilliant high-comedy playing of Isabel Jeans , who as Aunt Alicia consummately portrays the distinction and beauty of a retired aristocrat of the '' demimonde '' . " Bosley Crowther of '' The New York Times '' called it " a musical film that bears such a basic resemblance to '' My Fair Lady '' that the authors may want to sue themselves " . He added , " But do n't think this point of resemblance is made in criticism of the film , for '' Gigi '' is a charming entertainment that can stand on its own two legs . It is not only a charming comprehension of the spicy confection of Colette , but it is also a lovely and lyrical enlargement upon that story 's flavored mood and atmosphere … Vincente Minnelli has marshaled a cast to give a set of performances that , for quality and harmony , are superb . " Abel Green of '' Variety '' called the film " 100 % escapist fare " and predicted it " is destined for a global box-office mop-up " . He added , " Alan Jay Lerner 's libretto is tailor-made for an inspired casting job for all principals , and Fritz Loewe 's tunes ( to Lerner 's lyrics ) already vie with and suggest their memorable '' My Fair Lady '' score … Miss Caron is completely captivating and convincing in the title role … Skillful casting , performance and presentation have endowed realism to the sum total … Director Minnelli 's good taste in keeping it in bounds and the general sound judgment of all concerned … distinguishes this Arthur Freed independent production . The Metrocolor rates recognition for its soft pastels under Joseph Ruttenberg 's lensing ; the Beaton costumes , sets and general production design are vivid physical assets at first sight . The skillful integration of words-and-music with the plot motivation makes this '' Gigi '' a very fair lady indeed as a boxoffice entry . " '' Time Out New York '' said , " The dominating creative contribution comes from Minnelli and Cecil Beaton … The combination of these two visual elitists is really too much — it 's like a meal consisting of cheesecake , and one quickly longs for something solid and vulgar to weigh things down . No doubt inspired by the finicky , claustrophobic sets and bric-à-brac , the cast tries ( with unfortunate success ) to be more French than the French , especially Chevalier . The exception is Gingold , who inhabits , as always , a world of her own . " '' TV Guide '' rated the film 3 ½ out of five stars , calling it " Overbaked but enjoyable , and a banquet for the eyes , thanks to the visual wonder of the Minnelli-Beaton teaming … Caron … leads the cast in a contest to see who can be the most French . The winner is Chevalier , in a performance that makes one feel as if you 're gagging on pastry … Perhaps if the sweetness of '' Gigi '' was contrasted with elements of honest vulgarity , the picture could balance itself out … Ten minutes into the movie , you 've resolved the plot and are left to wallow in lovely frou-frou . The film makes wonderful use of the usual Parisian landmarks , and benefits from extraordinary period costumes and sets . " '' Gigi '' won a record-breaking nine Academy Awards ( at the 1959 Oscars ceremony ) ; however , this record only lasted for one year , as '' Ben-Hur '' broke this record the following year with 11 Oscars . In tribute to '' Gigi '' s domination of the Oscars , the MGM switchboard answered calls the following day with " M-Gigi-M " . '' Gigi '' , eventually along with 1987 's '' The Last Emperor '' , held the record as the film ( s ) with the most Academy Award wins in every category in which it was nominated , until 2003 's '' The Lord of the Rings : The Return of the King '' broke the record at the 2004 Oscars ceremony with 11 Oscar nominations and 11 Oscar wins

		CONTEXT=Other media outlets received the broadcast more positively . Film critic Roger Ebert noted that Rock " opened on a high-energy quick-talking note " He also added , " Chris Rock hit a home run with his opening monologue , which was surprisingly pointed , topical , and not shy of controversy . " Television critic Frazier Moore commented that Rock 's performance was a " needed pick-me-up , presiding over the broadcast with saucy finesse . " He added , " In sum , the broadcast felt brisk , though not rushed . It felt modern and refreshingly free of chronic self-importance . " Brian Lowry of '' Variety '' gave an average review of Rock but remarked , " For all the hand-wringing about the awards descending into the muck , the 77th Academy Awards proved a classy affair , with precious little red meat to satiate Hollywood bashers . " The American telecast on ABC drew an average of 42.14 million people over its length , which was a 3 % decrease from the previous year 's ceremony . The show also drew lower Nielsen ratings compared to the two previous ceremonies with 25.4 of households watching over a 38 share .

After the February 1994 massacre by Baruch Goldstein of 30 Muslim civilians in a Hebron mosque , the al-Qassam Brigades expanded suicide attacks to target primarily civilians . The first of the suicide bombings that targeted civilians was at Afula on April 16 , 1994 , when a suicide bomber detonated an explosives-laden car next to a bus , killing nine ( including the bomber ) and wounding 50 . The most deadly suicide bombing was an attack on a Netanya hotel on March 27 , 2002 , in which 30 people were killed and 140 were wounded .

		SCORE=0.00015364264254458249
		CONTEXT=Kalam 's desire to meet spiritual leaders to help create a more prosperous , spiritual , and unified India was what initially led him to meet Pramukh Swami , the Hindu guru of the BAPS Swaminarayan Sampradaya , who Kalam would come to consider his ultimate spiritual teacher and guru . The first of eight meetings between Kalam and Pramukh Swami over a fourteen-year period took place on 30 June 2001 in New Delhi , during which Kalam described being immediately drawn to Pramukh Swami 's simplicity and spiritual purity . Kalam stated that he was inspired by Pramukh Swami throughout their numerous interactions . One such incident occurred the day following the terrorist attack on BAPS ' Akshardham , Gandhinagar complex in September 2002 ; Pramukh Swami prayed for , and sprinkled holy water upon , the sites of all of the deceased , including the terrorists , demonstrating the view that all human life is sacred . Kalam recalled being moved by Pramukh Swami 's equanimity and compassion , citing this incident as one of his motivations for writing '' Transcendence : My Spiritual Experiences with Pramukh Swamiji '' . Summarising the effect that Pramukh Swami had on him , Kalam stated that " Pramukh Swami has indeed transformed me . He is the ultimate stage of the spiritual ascent in my life ... Pramukh Swamiji has put me in a God-synchronous orbit . No manoeuvres are required any more , as I am placed in my final position in eternity . " Following Kalam 's death a month after his final book was released , co-author Arun Tiwari pointed to this passage as potentially prophetic and premonitory of Kalam 's death

		CONTEXT=The Temple of Bacchus — once wrongly credited to Jupiter — may have been completed under Septimius Severus in the 190s , as his coins are the first to show it beside the Temple of Jupiter . It is the best preserved of the sanctuary 's structures , as the other rubble from its ruins protected it . It is enriched by some of the most refined reliefs and sculpture to survive from antiquity . The temple is surrounded by forty-two columns — 8 along each end and 15 along each side — nearly in height . These were probably erected in a rough state and then rounded , polished , and decorated in position . The entrance was preserved as late as Pococke and Wood , but the keystone of the lintel had slid following the 1759 earthquakes ; a column of rough masonry was erected in the 1860s or '70s to support it . The 1759 earthquakes also damaged the area around the soffit 's famed inscription of an eagle , which was entirely covered by the keystone 's supporting column.The area around the inscription of the eagle was greatly damaged by the 1759 earthquake . The interior of the temple is divided into a nave and a adytum or sanctuary on a platform raised above it and fronted by 13 steps . The screen between the two sections once held reliefs of Neptune , Triton , Arion and his dolphin , and other marine figures but these have been lost . The temple was used as a kind of donjon for the medieval Arab and Turkish fortifications , although its eastern steps were lost sometime after 1688 . Much of the portico was incorporated into a huge wall directly before its gate , but this was demolished in July 1870 by Barker on orders from Syria 's governor Rashid Pasha . Two spiral staircases in columns on either side of the entrance lead to the roof

Rachit Gupta from '' Filmfare '' gave the film a rating of 4.5 / 5 , stating , " SS Rajamouli 's much-awaited sequel is the kind of movie Indian cinema should make regularly . It 's the kind of sweeping magnum opus that Indian mythos and culture deserve . It 's the biggest film we have ever made and barring a few minor glitches in CGI , this film is possibly the greatest spectacle you 'll see on a big screen , in your life . " Sangeetha Devi Dundoo from '' The Hindu '' stated , " For the most part , The Conclusion does n't let us take our eyes off the screen . It 's designed to be a cinematic celebration , one that deserves to be watched on the largest screen possible " . Anupama Subramanian of the '' Deccan Chronicle '' gave the film a 3.5 / 5 , praising the acting of the stars while complaining about " the lack of a solid plot ' and called the ending " predictable . " Vishnuprasad Pillai of '' Asianet News '' gave a negative review , writing that the film " offers nothing new ... The writing from KV Vijayendra Prasad fails inspire or to do justice to an epic of such scale , " adding that " the dialogues at times are downright corny and plot developments cringe-worthy . " Dipanjan Sinha of '' Hindustan Times '' gave the film a rating of 3/5 stars , praising the film 's cinematography and special effects , but found faults with some of the female characters . Sinha stated , " Devasena ... starts off as an ace warrior only to be tamed into someone who has to be protected . " Shubhra Gupta of '' Indian Express '' rated the film 2/5 stars , noting problems with pacing and sound , writing , " The background music is relentless , and the pitch at which the declamatory dialogues are delivered is deafening : there were times I felt like closing my ears . " Taran Adarsh of '' Bollywood Hungama '' rates the film 4.5 out of 5 and praises the performance of the cast , writing , " It 's a feast for moviegoers and has the trappings to make all generations its fan . " Meena Iyer from '' The Times of India '' rated it 4/5 , writing : " Just savor it . It is a visual extravaganza that India must feast on ... Prabhas is terrific as father and son . Of course , it is CGI and VFX that grab you in your seat . " Hemanth Kumar from '' Firstpost '' called it " Rajamouli 's epic drama " and rated it 4/5 . Sukanya Verma from '' Rediff '' rated the film 3.5 / 5 , writing the film , " continues its tradition of grandiloquence and magnitude ... high drama , more than spectacle , is what lends its riveting tale of revenge and glory all its wallop and wizardry . " She also praised the film 's cast and director stating , " Equipped with a cast that 's not only in tune with Rajamouli 's vision but knows exactly where to hold back and when to give their all adds to Baahubali 's might . " It was further featured in Rotten Tomatoes ' list of Best Off the Radar Films of 2017 , in which Tim Ryan writes , " '' Baahubali 2 : The Conclusion '' plays like a shotgun wedding between '' Ben Hur '' and '' Kung Fu Hustle '' , seasoned with bits of Shakespeare , Kurosawa , and Buster Keaton , " opining , " it 's a blockbuster that 's both gigantic and lighter than air . " Mike McCahill of The Guardian gave a 4/5 rating and called it " a jaw-dropping blockbuster that combines nimble action with genuine heart " . He also stated , " This production 's triumph is the room it 's granted Rajamouli to head into the fields and dream up endlessly expressive ways to frame bodies in motion . Of the many sequences here primed to cut through jadedness , perhaps the most wondrous is that which finds Baahu guiding Deva mid-battle to shoot three arrows simultaneously – a set piece that speaks both to a love of action , and love in action . The budget 's big , the muscle considerable , but they 're nothing compared with '' Baahubali '' s heart . " Manjusha Radhakrishnan of '' Gulf News '' rates the film 3.5 out of 5 and writes , " This is a sweeping visual spectacle filled with epic battle scenes , clashes between warring troops from Indian mythology and elephants on a rampage , " but further added , " There were times in the second half where you felt the computer-generated graphics took over the story . But all this is new and exotic for Indian cinema . " Shilpa Jamkhandikar of '' Reuters '' writes , " It may not up the ante from the last film , but it does n't let up on the pace either . For an Indian film , that is no mean feat . " J Hurtado of '' ScreenAnarchy '' writes , " It 's a bit daunting because it does begin in media res immediately following the complex actions of the first film , but astute viewers will put together the pieces soon enough . " Kabita Maharana of '' International Business Times '' gave a rating of 4 out of 5 and writes , " From the very first scene , the film is a visual extravaganza . Every frame is meticulously captured by SS Rajamouli and his team . This is the first Indian film hailed for excelling in visual effects . " Simon Abrams of RogerEbert.com gave the film a 4/4 rating and writes the film " is everything I want but rarely get from superhero and big-budget fantasy movie " adding " the fight scenes ... are so creative that they make even the most frequently abused creative shortcuts seem novel , everything from computer-generated imagery ( CGI ) to speed-ramping ... You care what happens to the cast as they , aided by wires , hurl volleys of arrows at disposable minions and CGI animals . " Anita Iyer from '' Khaleej Times '' rates the film 3.5 out of 5 and writes , " What stands out in the film is the powerful star cast . Enough has been said already about the acting prowess of Prabhas but he has an equally supportive cast to hold the film . Ramya Krishna as Sivagami , is known for her impressive acting talent and proves her mettle here . Another veteran , Sathyaraj as Katappa excels and you develop a camaraderie with him . Rana Daggubati is aptly spiteful in his portrayal of the villain ... Nassar , as his father , is busy spewing venom but his role could have been meatier . " '' The Conclusion '' won the Telstra People 's Choice Award at the Indian Film Festival of Melbourne , sharing the prize with '' Dangal '' . Tamannaah Bhatia and K.V. Vijayendra Prasad won the Global Indian Impact Icon Award for '' The Conclusion '' at NRI of the Year Awards .

		CONTEXT=Tamannaah 's first release of 2009 was the Tamil film '' Padikkadavan '' , directed by Suraj and co-starring Dhanush , which was named after Rajinikanth 's 1985 film of the same name . The film received mixed reviews from critics , but Tamannaah 's performance in a limited role won praise . '' Padikkadavan '' however , became a commercial success . Her next release was the Telugu film '' Konchem Ishtam Konchem Kashtam '' , directed by Kishore Kumar Pardasany , co-starring Siddharth . The film received positive reviews from critics and she received critical acclaim for her performance , earning a nomination at the 57th Filmfare Awards South in the Best Telugu Actress category . The film , however , was an average grosser at the box office . Her next release , K. V. Anand 's '' Ayan '' , co-starring Suriya , became the only major commercially successful Tamil film of the year . She later appeared in Gandhi Krishna 's '' Ananda Thandavam '' , which was based on the novel '' Pirivom Santhippom '' serialised by Sujatha Rangarajan . She was paired with Siddharth Venugopal in the film , marking the latter 's debut . The film opened to negative reviews , and was her only commercial failure in 2009 . However , Tamannaah 's performance was critically acclaimed . Pavithra Srinivasan of Rediff.com stated that Tamannaah 's " would-be innocence when she 's playing up to Sidharth , and slight cunning when she chooses Radhakrishnan is perfect " adding that she brought her character Madhumitha " to life , an alluring mix of child and woman ; irritating , sly , yet arousing your sympathy in the climax "

		SCORE=2.7707704248314258e-05
		CONTEXT=Although filming began in 1987 , the film was released only a year after . It turned out to be a box-office failure but won critical acclaim . Balu Mahendra admitted that he did not expect the film to be a box-office success or a failure , but would have the satisfaction of having made a good film . Archana 's portrayal as a middle-class woman fetched her a lot of accolades from the critics . Chokkalinga Bhagavathar , who played her grandfather , received equal praise . He was a strong contender for that year 's National Film Award for Best Actor , but eventually lost to Kamal Haasan . At the 35th National Film Awards , the film won in two categories – Best Feature Film in Tamil , and Best Actress for Archana . The film was among the 16 films to be screened at the Indian Panorama section of the International Film Festival of India in 1988 . In 2002 , the film was screened at the " Indian Summer " section of the Locarno International Film Festival . In a 2013 review , '' Ananda Vikatan '' called '' Veedu '' to be among the two films that took Tamil cinema to world cinema level . Further , it praised the film for highlighting the plight of Indian middle-class families and the political set up of the nation . It stated '' Veedu '' was one of the few Tamil films that scores good on both content and narration , and also appreciated Balu Mahendra 's directorial skills . Critics praised the film for being more visual and Balu Mahendra 's understanding of cinema as a visual medium . However , the magazine criticised the usage of background score in the film as it felt it lessened the impact of an otherwise good film . S. Theodore Baskaran in his '' The Eye of The Serpent : An Introduction To Tamil Cinema '' states that '' Veedu '' was a " striking departure " from the previous films of Balu Mahendra , as it was devoid of commercial elements like dance , songs , fight and comedy sequences . While analysing Archana 's characterisation , Baskaran noted Balu Mahendra 's penchant for strong characterisation of his female leads . Balu Mahendra had to construct a house which was mean to be a set for the house which was shown in the film . The building which was later fully constructed , now houses the film school started by Balu Mahendra in 2007 . In many interviews , Balu Mahendra had claimed that '' Veedu '' and '' Sandhya Raagam '' were the only films that satisfied him the most as he made these two the least number of mistakes and compromises . The film is widely considered to be one of the finest works of Balu Mahendra . The negative of the film is lost

In previous years , countries that received a top 10 placing were automatically granted a spot in the next year 's final without having to compete in a semi-final , but for 2008 , the EBU changed the automatic qualification regulations so that all countries except the " Big 4 " ( France , Germany , Spain , and the United Kingdom ) and host country , would have to pass through one of two semi-finals . The EBU split up countries with a friendly voting history into separate semi-finals , to give a better chance for other countries to win . Greece and Cyprus had often been accused of favoring each other , with each awarding the other the maximum number of points ( twelve ) at the previous contest . On January 28 , 2008 , the EBU held a special draw which determined that Greece would be in '' Semi-final 1 '' held on May 20 , 2008 in Belgrade , Serbia ; Cyprus was subsequently placed in the second semi-final

		CONTEXT=The team 's inaugural home game was played on October 10 , 2017 , hosting the Arizona Coyotes as the second game of a home-and-home series . In the aftermath of the October 1 mass shooting , the pre-game ceremonies honored the victims of the attack , and the team issued an appeal for donations to its charitable arm . With their 5 – 2 win , the Golden Knights increased their unbeaten streak to start the season to 3 – 0 , an NHL record for an expansion team . The Golden Knights are the first team in NHL history to have started their inaugural season winning eight of their first nine games . During their tenth game , goaltender Oscar Dansk was injured becoming the third Golden Knights ' goaltender to be injured during the season after losing starters Fleury and the recently acquired Malcolm Subban , forcing the team to start a fourth goaltender in 11 games with Maxime Lagace . Fifteen games into the season , Vadim Shipachyov became the first player to retire from the NHL as a Golden Knight when he decided to return to the Kontinental Hockey League . In December , the Golden Knights set another NHL expansion team record of six straight wins , a record they had previously missed when they lost their tenth game of the season , and established a new NHL record with eight straight wins . On February 1 , 2018 , the Golden Knights set the expansion team record for wins in a debut season with 34 wins after only 50 games , and then on February 21 , 2018 , set a record for most points by an expansion team in the inaugural season with 84 . Clinching a berth for the 2018 playoffs on March 26 , the Golden Knights became the first team since the Edmonton Oilers and Hartford Whalers in the 1979 – 80 season to make the playoffs in their inaugural season in the league . On March 31 , the Knights clinched the Pacific Division title , becoming the first true expansion team in the four major sports to win its division in its inaugural season ( not counting all-expansion divisions , as was the case in the 1967 – 68 season ) . They had led the Pacific since December 23 , 2017

QUERY_CONTEXT=Duane Allman created the idea of having two lead guitarists , which was inspired by Curtis Mayfield ; " he wanted the bass , keyboards , and second guitar to form patterns behind the solo rather than just comping , " said Allman . Their style and incorporation of guitar harmonies was very influential on later musicians . " The pair also had a wide range of complementary techniques , often forming intricate , interlocking patterns with each other and with the bassist , Berry Oakley , setting the stage for dramatic flights of improvised melodies . " Dickey Betts ' playing was very melody-based ; " My style is just a little too smooth and round to play the blues stuff straight , because I 'm such a melody guy that even when I 'm playing the blues , I go for melody first , " he said . His listening of country and string bluegrass growing up influenced this considerably : " I played mandolin , ukulele , and fiddle before I ever touched a guitar , which may be where a lot of the major keys I play come from . " He later characterized their style as " question and answer , anticipation and conclusion , " which involved allowing each musician 's downbeat to arrive in a different spot , while also keeping consideration of the bass guitar lines . The group also held an improvisational approach to live performances , which connected the band with jam band culture . " Jazz and blues musicians have been doing this for decades , but I think they really brought that sense that anyone onstage can inspire anyone else at any given time to rock music , " said Haynes . " We sure did n't set out to be a " jam band " but those long jams just emanated from within the band , because we did n't want to just play three minutes and be over , " said Allman . '' Rolling Stone '' referred to the group as " without question the first great jam band , and they took the jam to heights that it had not previously reached . " The Allman Brothers Band were considerably influential within the Southern United States . Their arrival on the musical scene paved the way for several other notable Southern rock bands — among those Lynyrd Skynyrd , the Marshall Tucker Band and Wet Willie — to achieve commercial success , and also " almost single-handedly " made Capricorn Records into " a major independent label . " Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top , writing for '' Rolling Stone '' , wrote that the group " defined the best of every music from the American South in that time . They were the best of all of us . " He went on to call the band " a true brotherhood of players — one that went beyond race and ego . It was a thing of beauty . " The band 's extended popularity through heavy touring in the early 1990s created a new generation of fans , one that viewed the Allmans as pioneers of " latter-day collegiate jam rock . " AllMusic praised the band 's history : " they went from being America 's single most influential band to a shell of their former self trading on past glories , to reach the 21st century resurrected as one of the most respected rock acts of their era . " In 2012 , an official historic marker was erected on the site of the July 1970 Second Atlanta International Pop Festival near Byron , Georgia . The Allman Brothers Band had played two sets at the festival , which was a significant event in their career . The marker text reads , in part : " Over thirty musical acts performed , including ... Macon 's Allman Brothers Band on their launching pad to national fame . " Official sponsors of the marker included the Georgia Allman Brothers Band Association , The Allman Brothers Band Museum at the Big House , and '' Hittin ' the Note '' . In 2003 , the band released a recording of their festival opening and closing performances , '' Live at the Atlanta International Pop Festival : July 3 & 5 , 1970 ''

QUERY_CONTEXT=In a positive review for '' Cuepoint '' , Robert Christgau argued that while Azalea may never demonstrate a powerful , soulful , or attractively melodic delivery , her " striving Australian-Atlantan cadence " is original and carries every song . He deemed ' ' The New Classic '' " plenty authentic -- and damn good to boot " while dismissing Azalea 's media naysayers : " predictably , the songs where she expresses wonderment that ' Impossible Is Nothing ' are more relatable than the ones where she flaunts her liquid assets . But the ones where she pledges to keep on striving are more relatable than that , because striving is built into her flow itself . That 's what her complexity is about . " Phil Johnson from '' The Independent '' called it " an instantly engaging showcase of the 23-year-old Aussie 's talents – poppy without diluting her fierce-flowing charisma . " Kellan Miller of '' XXL '' said despite some poor songs near the end of the record , it is " a persuasive indicator that Iggy Azalea will be around for the long haul . " '' The New Classic '' was named one of the best hip-hop albums of the year by '' XXL '' on a list published on 30 June 2014 , adding that " the album proved to a gang of skepts who doubted Iggy 's controversial style from the start that she was more than capable of making hip-hop tracks with a pop appeal . " It was placed at number twenty-five on Digital Spy 's top albums of 2014 and listed among Fuse 's 40 best albums of 2014 . The album won the Breakthrough Artist Release award at the 2014 ARIA Music Awards and Favorite Rap/Hip-Hop Album at the 2014 American Music Awards , beating out Drake 's '' Nothing Was the Same '' and Eminem 's '' The Marshall Mathers LP 2 '' . It received a nomination for Best Rap Album at the 57th Grammy Awards . The album was also up for Top Rap Album at the 2015 Billboard Music Awards

		CONTEXT=In a positive review for '' Cuepoint '' , Robert Christgau argued that while Azalea may never demonstrate a powerful , soulful , or attractively melodic delivery , her " striving Australian-Atlantan cadence " is original and carries every song . He deemed ' ' The New Classic '' " plenty authentic -- and damn good to boot " while dismissing Azalea 's media naysayers : " predictably , the songs where she expresses wonderment that ' Impossible Is Nothing ' are more relatable than the ones where she flaunts her liquid assets . But the ones where she pledges to keep on striving are more relatable than that , because striving is built into her flow itself . That 's what her complexity is about . " Phil Johnson from '' The Independent '' called it " an instantly engaging showcase of the 23-year-old Aussie 's talents – poppy without diluting her fierce-flowing charisma . " Kellan Miller of '' XXL '' said despite some poor songs near the end of the record , it is " a persuasive indicator that Iggy Azalea will be around for the long haul . " '' The New Classic '' was named one of the best hip-hop albums of the year by '' XXL '' on a list published on 30 June 2014 , adding that " the album proved to a gang of skepts who doubted Iggy 's controversial style from the start that she was more than capable of making hip-hop tracks with a pop appeal . " It was placed at number twenty-five on Digital Spy 's top albums of 2014 and listed among Fuse 's 40 best albums of 2014 . The album won the Breakthrough Artist Release award at the 2014 ARIA Music Awards and Favorite Rap/Hip-Hop Album at the 2014 American Music Awards , beating out Drake 's '' Nothing Was the Same '' and Eminem 's '' The Marshall Mathers LP 2 '' . It received a nomination for Best Rap Album at the 57th Grammy Awards . The album was also up for Top Rap Album at the 2015 Billboard Music Awards

QUERY_ANSWERS={'Caltavuturo massacre'}

According to Ibn al-Athir ( '' The Complete History '' , VII .370.5 – 7 ) , in AH 268 ( 881/82 CE ) , the Aghlabid commander Abū Ṯawr was defeated by the Byzantines ( probably commanded by the '' strategos '' Mosilikes ) and his was army annihilated , with only seven men surviving . The locality was later named in Arabic '' Qalʿat Abī Ṯawr '' ( " Castle of Abū Ṯawr " ) , which is the origin of the modern name . Others instead maintain that the name derives from the Arabic word " qal ' at " ( fortress ) and the Sicilian " vuturu " ( vulture ) meaning of " fortress of vultures . " The town existed under Byzantine rule pre Arab conquest as Aziz Ahmad in “ A Islamic History of Sicily ” ( edinburgh university press 1975 ) states that in 852 Abbas raided Caltavuturo in the northern part of the Island and took many prisoners who were sold as slaves , The town was the site of the so-called Caltavuturo massacre on 20 January 1893 , when local authorities killed 13 and wounded 21 peasants that had occupied communal land that they claimed was theirs

		CONTEXT=Crispi was replaced as prime minister by Antonio Di Rudinì in February 1891 , who was succeeded by Giovanni Giolitti in May 1892 . On January 20 , 1893 , when peasants of Caltavuturo occupied communal land that they claimed was theirs , local authorities killed 13 and wounded 21 in the Caltavuturo massacre . Disturbances continued throughout the year . The Fasci started out as urban movements , animated by artisans , which evolved into a more popular and combative mass movement with the adherence of sulphur miners , and in a later stage with the involvement of peasants and sharecroppers . In the autumn of 1893 , labour conflicts in the cities and the mines came together with the protests and claims of the farmers . The movement reached its greatest breadth in the manifestations against taxes , involving the lowest tiers of the city and the countryside , becoming difficult , if not impossible , to control by its leaders

		CONTEXT=Carmelite and the children returned to the Beloit for the period from 1888 to 1890 for the children 's education and then returned to Turkey . In 1893 the family moved to Tarsus to take up a post at St. Paul 's College . Carmelite by character and situation assumed non-traditional roles overseas . As part of his duties , Thomas left Turkey to raise money or went to surrounding mission stations to support them . In addition to her family responsibilities , she was involved in the activities of St. Paul 's College and the education of women and a supporter of suffrage for unmarried women . After the 1895 massacre at Marash , Carmelite wrote letters describing the events which were published in American newspapers . She reported on deaths , woundings , damage to the schools in Marash and threats to the missionary workers . Her reports were personal , having spent fifteen years among those who were living through the crisis and in one letter , she reported that she and her husband had been warned regarding violence which might spread to Tarsus . By August , the rioting had reached them , though the Christies were not at the school when it was looted . In the face of the ongoing violence , the family fled to Mersina , and eventually Carmelite returned with the children to the United States between 1897 and 1898 for their safety and schooling

		CONTEXT=This understanding was formally ratified during a visit to Saint Petersburg , on which he accompanied the emperor in April 1897 . He took the lead in establishing the European concert during the Armenian massacres of 1896 , and again resisted isolated action on the part of any of the great powers during the Cretan troubles and the Greco-Turkish War . In November 1897 , when the Austro-Hungarian flag was insulted at Mersina , he threatened to bombard the town if instant reparation were not made , and by his firm attitude greatly enhanced Austrian prestige in the East . In his speech to the delegations in 1898 he dwelt on the necessity of expanding Austria 's mercantile marine , and of raising the fleet to a strength which , while not vying with the fleets of the great naval powers , would ensure respect for the Austrian flag wherever her interests needed protection . He also hinted at the necessity for European combination to resist American competition

Soon they became involved in wide-ranging counterguerrilla operations , which they carried out with great ruthlessness , based on their experiences in Yugoslavia . In the course of these operations , mass reprisals were carried out , resulting in war crimes such as at Kommeno on August 16 , the Massacre of Kalavryta in December and the Massacre of Distomo in June 1944 .

While all German police organizations were controlled by Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler in his capacity as Chief of German Police in the Interior Ministry , they were not at this time considered part of the SS , nor was the '' Polizei '' Division on par with the other Waffen-SS divisions . This status was reflected in the quality of the equipment they were issued and their retention of police insignia and rank structure . The division was transferred to the Waffen-SS in 1942 and was upgraded to a '' Panzergrenadier '' division .

On 5 April 1944 , the German occupation forces under the command of Karl Schümers , commander of the 7th regiment of the 4th Armored Division of the SS , the same unit to later that year commit the massacre in Distomo , slaughtered the women and children of Kleisoura in retaliation for the execution of three German soldiers by ELAS close to the village . The ELAS guerrillas , led by Alexis Rosios from Siatisti ( " Captain Ypsilantis " ) , who were active in the region , had attacked a German military phalanx at Daouli , close to Kleisoura , and had killed a vanguard of three motorcyclists . According to testimonies , the male residents , fearing retaliation , fled to the mountains surrounding the village . After finding the mutilated bodies of the Wehrmacht soldiers close to the local church , the German SS unit went to the homes , broke the doors of the majority of the houses , shot the people within , set fire to the buildings and also killed whom they found in the streets .

		CONTEXT=Operation Steinadler ( 3 – 13 July 1944 ) was the last counter-insurgency operation carried out by German forces in Macedonia . Although wide in its scope it ultimately failed to achieve its objectives as ELAS fighters successfully evaded the German patrols , returning to their hideouts once the operation was over . The civilian population thus became the main target for Axis reprisals . Shortly afterwards the German 1st Mountain Division and the 4th SS Polizei Panzergrenadier Division departed from the country , while in August Army Group E declared Greece a war zone . German shops and cultural institutions were closed , while civilians and older member of the army , secret police and SS were evacuated . Under Adolf Hitler 's orders the Wehrmacht adopted the policy of total war , in response to the rise of ELAS subversive activity which had hampered the summer harvest in areas still controlled by the collaborationist government . Army Group E 's staff deemed the preceding Distomo massacre and 1 May 1944 Kaisariani executions as excessive and even damaging to the image of the occupational authorities . The staff stressed the need to arrest insurgents rather than resorting to the collective punishment of civilians . Nevertheless , those orders were disregarded and atrocities continued unhindered . Between June and August , ELAS attacks led to the death of 30 German soldiers , 14 were wounded and 9 more were missing in action . German reprisals in their turn included the execution of 254 people

		CONTEXT=In May 1943 the division transferred for garrison duties to the Greek island of Cefalonia . After Italy 's surrender to the Allies on 3 September 1943 the divisions commanding general Antonio Gandin was left without clear orders from his superiors . Therefore , Gandin decided to let his soldiers vote on 13 September 1943 as to what to do to next . The troops voted overwhelmingly to fight their former allies the Germans , thus the '' Acqui '' became one of the very few Italian units to actively resist the Germans . The Germans therefore summarily executed over half of the divisions soldiers and all of its officers in revenge during the Massacre of the Acqui Division

		CONTEXT=Operation Steinadler ( 3 – 13 July 1944 ) was the last counter-insurgency operation carried out by German forces in Macedonia . Although wide in its scope it ultimately failed to achieve its objectives as ELAS fighters successfully evaded the German patrols , returning to their hideouts once the operation was over . The civilian population thus became the main target for Axis reprisals . Shortly afterwards the German 1st Mountain Division and the 4th SS Polizei Panzergrenadier Division departed from the country , while in August Army Group E declared Greece a war zone . German shops and cultural institutions were closed , while civilians and older member of the army , secret police and SS were evacuated . Under Adolf Hitler 's orders the Wehrmacht adopted the policy of total war , in response to the rise of ELAS subversive activity which had hampered the summer harvest in areas still controlled by the collaborationist government . Army Group E 's staff deemed the preceding Distomo massacre and 1 May 1944 Kaisariani executions as excessive and even damaging to the image of the occupational authorities . The staff stressed the need to arrest insurgents rather than resorting to the collective punishment of civilians . Nevertheless , those orders were disregarded and atrocities continued unhindered . Between June and August , ELAS attacks led to the death of 30 German soldiers , 14 were wounded and 9 more were missing in action . German reprisals in their turn included the execution of 254 people

QUERY_CONTEXT=Blaine 's career as a Republican newspaperman led naturally to involvement in Republican party politics . In 1856 , he was selected as a delegate to the first Republican National Convention . From the party 's early days , Blaine identified with the conservative wing , supporting Supreme Court Justice John McLean for the presidential nomination over the more radical John C. Frémont , the eventual nominee . The following year , Blaine was offered the editorship of the '' Portland Daily Advertiser '' , which he accepted , selling his interest in the '' Journal '' soon thereafter . He still maintained his home in Augusta , however , with his growing family . Although Blaine 's first son , Stanwood , died in infancy , he and Harriet had two more sons soon afterward : Walker , in 1855 , and Emmons , in 1857 . They would have four more children in years to come : Alice , James , Margaret , and Harriet . It was around this time that Blaine left the Presbyterian church of his childhood and joined his wife 's new denomination , becoming a member of the South Parish Congregational Church in Augusta

QUERY_CONTEXT=The first official Republican convention in Illinois was held on May 29 , 1856 , in Bloomington . Chairman John M. Palmer was elected convention president after his opening address . Nine vice presidents and five secretaries were then elected . The convention nominated Bissell for governor with Francis Hoffmann as lieutenant governor , Ozias M. Hatch for secretary of state , Jesse K. Dubois as auditor , and James Miller as treasurer . Hoffmann was found to be ineligible for his position due to a residency requirement , and John Wood was nominated in his place . The following resolutions defining the party platform were approved : Resolved , That foregoing all former differences of opinions upon other questions , we pledge ourselves to unite in opposition to the present administration and to the party which upholds and supports it and to use all honorable and constitutional means to wrest the Government from the unworthy hands which now control it and to bring it back in its administration to the principles and practices of Washington , Jefferson and their great and good compatriots of the Revolution . Resolved , That foregoing all former differences of opinions upon other questions , we pledge ourselves to unite in opposition to the present administration of the Government ; that under the Constitution Congress possesses the power to prohibit slavery in the Territories ; and that , whilst we will maintain all constitutional rights of the South , we also hold that justice , humanity , the principles of freedom as expressed in our Declaration of Independence and our national constitution , and the purity and perpetuity of our Government require that that power shall be exerted to prevent the extension of slavery into territory heretofore free . Resolved , That the repeal of the Missouri Compromise was unwise and injurious ; an open and aggravated violation of the plighted faith of the States , and that the attempt of the present administration to force slavery into Kansas against the known wishes of the legal voters of that Territory is an arbitrary and tyrannous violation of the rights of the people to govern themselves , and that we will strive by all constitutional means to secure to Kansas and Nebraska the legal guaranty against slavery of which they were deprived at the cost of the violation of the plighted faith of the nation . Resolved , That we are devoted to the Union and will , to the last extremity , defend it against the efforts now being made by the dis-unionists of this administration to compass its dissolution , and that we will support the Constitution of the United States , in all its provisions regarding it , as the sacred bond of our Union and the only safeguard for the preservation of the rights of ourselves and our posterity . Resolved , That we are in favor of the immediate admission of Kansas as a member of this Confederacy under the constitution adopted by the people of said Territory . Resolved , That the spirit of our institutions as well as the Constitution of our country , guarantees the liberty of conscience as well as political freedom , and that we will proscribe no one by legislation or otherwise on account of religious opinions , or in consequence of place of birth . Lincoln delivered the closing address . The speech was purportedly so captivating that no reporter made a record of it . The address has become known as Lincoln 's Lost Speech . The delegates to the convention were : The Democrats had nominated Richardson for governor at their convention earlier that month . The remnants of the Whig party declined to run a candidate .

		CONTEXT=He arrived at the club as an incredibly shy and underdeveloped personality , a fact that was noted by teammate Trent Cotchin who said though Martin was 18 “ he seemed much younger in some of the ways he behaved . ” Indeed , he struggled initially to adjust to the expectations of professional football . In one incident in the 2010 preseason he was removed from training and verbally reprimanded by club leadership when he was deemed unfit to train after a big night out . Despite these struggles , his on-field development was such that he would still debut in the 2010 season 's opening match , a 56-point Richmond loss against at the MCG . Martin recorded the sixth most disposals of any Tiger ( 18 ) to go along with four marks , three tackles and three clearances . Two weeks later Martin was convicted by the AFL tribunal for a high hit on Sydney 's Josh Kennedy in round 3 . He did not receive a suspension for the incident however , returning to football the following week . After four matches Martin ranked fourth in the league for clearances and eighth for hard-ball gets .

		CONTEXT=He arrived at the club as an incredibly shy and underdeveloped personality , a fact that was noted by teammate Trent Cotchin who said though Martin was 18 “ he seemed much younger in some of the ways he behaved . ” Indeed , he struggled initially to adjust to the expectations of professional football . In one incident in the 2010 preseason he was removed from training and verbally reprimanded by club leadership when he was deemed unfit to train after a big night out . Despite these struggles , his on-field development was such that he would still debut in the 2010 season 's opening match , a 56-point Richmond loss against at the MCG . Martin recorded the sixth most disposals of any Tiger ( 18 ) to go along with four marks , three tackles and three clearances . Two weeks later Martin was convicted by the AFL tribunal for a high hit on Sydney 's Josh Kennedy in round 3 . He did not receive a suspension for the incident however , returning to football the following week . After four matches Martin ranked fourth in the league for clearances and eighth for hard-ball gets . Media reports emerged after round 8 that the 18 year old Martin had received a significant contract offer from expansion club the Greater Western Sydney Giants . The offer , which the Herald Sun ’s Mark Robinson claimed to be worth $ 2.4 million over three seasons , would have taken effect in the new club 's first AFL season in 2012 . Martin later said he had never entertained the idea of moving to the start-up club . In round 10 he had gained attention for his on-field efforts again , this time being nominated for the 2010 AFL Rising Star award after a 21 disposal and 11 clearance match against Port Adelaide . Due to his previous tribunal conviction however , Martin was ruled ineligible for the award and thus did not officially place in the end of season award 's points tally . He drew the attention of Sydney coach Paul Roos by round 14 , prompting Roos to send veteran Brett Kirk onto Martin in a tagging role . Despite this extra attention , he still managed to record 18 disposals and a goal in the match at the MCG . After 17 rounds Martin ranked second at the club for clearances and inside 50s as well as third for disposals and contested possessions . At the same time he ranked first among that season 's Rising Star nominees in clearances , contested possessions and inside 50s . He was also fourth for average disposals and fifth for average tackles . In round 19 he was rested by the club before returning to play out the final five matches of the season . He missed just that one game in his debut season and finished the year ranked second at Richmond for clearances and inside 50s , as well as third for both contested possessions and disposals . In addition to winning the Fred Swift Medal for fourth place at the club 's best and fairest night , Martin also received six votes in the Brownlow Medal count that year , the most by any Richmond debutant since Craig Lambert in 1988 . At season 's end he reiterated his commitment to the club ( and rejection of the former GWS overtures ) by signing a two-year contract extension that would keep him at Richmond until the end of the 2013 season . The extension was reported by the Herald Sun to be in the vicinity of $ 400,000-a-year

		CONTEXT=The Newton family home is located at 904 McDonald Avenue in Santa Rosa , which is still standing . The stone railway station in the film was built in 1904 for the Northwestern Pacific Railroad and is one of the few commercial buildings in central Santa Rosa to survive the earthquake of April 18 , 1906 . The station is currently a visitor center . The library was a Carnegie Library which was demolished in 1964 due to seismic concerns . Some of the buildings in the center of Santa Rosa that are seen in the film were damaged or destroyed by earthquakes in 1969 ; much of the area was cleared of debris and largely rebuilt . The film was scored by Dimitri Tiomkin , his first collaboration with Hitchcock ( the others being '' Strangers on a Train '' , '' I Confess '' and '' Dial M for Murder '' ) . In his score , Tiomkin quotes the '' Merry Widow Waltz '' of Franz Lehár , often in somewhat distorted forms , as a leitmotif for Uncle Charlie and his serial murders . During the opening credits , the waltz theme is heard along with a prolonged shot of couples dancing

QUERY_CONTEXT=And Japan was eager to take every opportunity . In 1869 they took advantage of the defeat of the rebels of the Republic of Ezo to incorporate definitely the island of Hokkaido to Japan . For centuries , Japan viewed the Ryukyu Islands as one of its provinces . In 1871 the Mudan incident happened : cannibal Taiwanese aborigines murdered 54 Ryūkyūan sailors that had their ship shipwrecked . At that time the Ryukyu Islands were claimed by both Qing China and Japan , and the Japanese interpreted the incident as an attack on their citizens . They took steps to bring the islands in their jurisdiction : in 1872 the Japanese Ryukyu Domain was declared , and in 1874 a retaliatory incursion to Taiwan was sent , which was a success . The success of this expedition emboldened the Japanese : not even the Americans could defeat the Taiwanese cannibals in the Formosa Expedition of 1867 . Very few gave it much thought at the time , but this was the first move in the Japanese expansionism series . Japan occupied Taiwan for the rest of 1874 and then left owing to Chinese pressures , but in 1879 it finally annexed the Ryukyu Islands . In 1875 Qing China sent a 300-men force to subdue the Taiwanese cannibals , but unlike the Japanese the Chinese were routed , ambushed and 250 of their men were killed ; the failure of this expedition exposed once more the failure of Qing China to exert effective control in Taiwan , and acted as another incentive for the Japanese to annex Taiwan .

		CONTEXT=And Japan was eager to take every opportunity . In 1869 they took advantage of the defeat of the rebels of the Republic of Ezo to incorporate definitely the island of Hokkaido to Japan . For centuries , Japan viewed the Ryukyu Islands as one of its provinces . In 1871 the Mudan incident happened : cannibal Taiwanese aborigines murdered 54 Ryūkyūan sailors that had their ship shipwrecked . At that time the Ryukyu Islands were claimed by both Qing China and Japan , and the Japanese interpreted the incident as an attack on their citizens . They took steps to bring the islands in their jurisdiction : in 1872 the Japanese Ryukyu Domain was declared , and in 1874 a retaliatory incursion to Taiwan was sent , which was a success . The success of this expedition emboldened the Japanese : not even the Americans could defeat the Taiwanese cannibals in the Formosa Expedition of 1867 . Very few gave it much thought at the time , but this was the first move in the Japanese expansionism series . Japan occupied Taiwan for the rest of 1874 and then left owing to Chinese pressures , but in 1879 it finally annexed the Ryukyu Islands . In 1875 Qing China sent a 300-men force to subdue the Taiwanese cannibals , but unlike the Japanese the Chinese were routed , ambushed and 250 of their men were killed ; the failure of this expedition exposed once more the failure of Qing China to exert effective control in Taiwan , and acted as another incentive for the Japanese to annex Taiwan . Eventually , the spoils for winning the First Sino-Japanese War in 1894 included Taiwan

		SCORE=0.0007079687929945067
		CONTEXT=There were numerous exiled German communists in Moscow , and they all used to report on one another to the Soviet authorities during the surge in political purges that accompanied growing political tensions domestically and internationally at this time . Such information demonstrated loyalty and was often blended with impressions or combined with denunciations . Hotropp himself provided a written report on Herwarth Walden , a fellow teacher at the Foreign Languages Institute who was later arrested . There was a perception that reports of this nature did not in themselves cause the authorities to arrest suspects , but they were certainly used by the NKVD where they provided evidential support for arrests that took place . Albert Hotopp 's own turn came on 31 May 1941 when he was arrested . On 1 August 1942 he was condemned to death . Available records are silent as to what happened next , but it is likely that he died shortly afterwards , probably in a Soviet labour camp . His wife Gertrud and their daughters were sent to continue their lives in Kazakhstan . His widow finally made her way back to East Germany in 1955 , after which she survived another thirty years . Albert Hotopp was formally rehabilitated by the Soviets in 1960

QUERY_CONTEXT=Writing for '' The New York Times '' , John J. O'Connor described the production as " a richly textured tapestry crammed with the social details that were the speciality of Mr. Delderfield " , with " a steady flow of insightful and touching moments " . He praised the performances of the cast and that of Duttine in particular . '' People '' magazine called the series a " colorful chronicle of post-World War I England that never crosses over to the gooey side of sentiment . " In a review for the DVD release in 2011 , '' PopMatters '' was less enthusiastic , calling Delderfield 's material " inconsequential " and writing : " The action veers sluggishly from the mildly diverting to the excruciatingly dull . " The review summarised the series as " basically a dated , dull , tiresome , tedious old drama by an author whose reputation is far from robust . " The adaptation was nominated in the Best Drama Series category at the 1981 British Academy Television Awards and in the Outstanding Limited Series category at the 1983 Primetime Emmy Awards

		CONTEXT=The region had already experienced several large earthquakes , the very large 1855 Wairarapa Earthquake , and the 1934 Pahiatua earthquake in the Northern Wairarapa . The 1855 earthquake occurred on the Wairarapa Fault which is part of the North Island Fault System . At 11.16 pm a small and sharp but brief earthquake of magnitude 7.2 Ms ( Mw 6.9-7.2 ) shook a wide area in the lower North Island from Eketahuna to Masterton , Featherston and Wellington ; and was noticed from Auckland to near Dunedin . The main earthquake was of 7.2 Ms and the epicentre was near Masterton and 12 km deep . The quake lasted for over a minute and had been preceded by a foreshock three hours earlier at 8.15 pm . Many buildings in Masterton were damaged . The mayor Thomas Jordan declared a state of emergency and got troops to patrol the town . There was considerable damage in Palmerston North . In Wellington twenty thousand chimneys fell , and there was one death in the suburb of Kelburn when a 70-year old retired chemist Hedley Victor Evens ( sic ) was killed by coal gas from a fractured pipe . Some downtown pediments were damaged , but some had already been removed after the 1931 Hawke 's Bay earthquake . The city engineer K. E . Luke held that damage was less severe as the quake ended swiftly . Another shock in the area struck on 2nd August at 12.34 am , preceded by a foreshock on the late afternoon of the 1st . This was of magnitude 7.0 Ms ( Mw 6.8 ) or slightly less than the earlier quake . The epicentre was 40 km deep and at location 41.01 ° S and 175.52 ° E. Wairarapa except for Eketahuna did not suffer as badly , though in Masterton the June damage was exacerbated . The 2 August aftershock was followed by a third severe aftershock on 2 December , with about 600 aftershocks recorded to the end of the year . Repairs from the first quake were not completed , and the mortar for some repairs had not properly set . Some buildings weakened in June suffered further damage , though it was sometimes hard to tell if further damage had occurred . In Masterton many buildings were badly damaged by the first quake ; the fire station , the Bank of New Zealand , several shops and St Matthews Church ( which was later blown up by the Army ) . The Waiohine road bridge was badly sunken and was closed . After the second quake the Wairarapa Farmers Co-op building partly collapsed . In Wellington the first quake toppled some twenty thousand chimneys . In August there was serious damage in the Willis Street – Manners Street area to three buildings : Charles Begg 's music shop , the Duke of Edinburgh Hotel , and the Regent Hotel

QUERY_CONTEXT='' The Lovers '' was produced by Paul Breuls ' Corsan NV , Dale G. Bradley 's Limelight International Media Entertainment , Wei Han 's Bliss Media and co-financed by Ajey Jhankar 's Neelmudra Entertainment . Sales outfit Corsan World Sales , a division of Corsan NV , is handling international sales . Previously known as '' The Invaders '' , the film was in works from the late 1990s and was due originally to feature Hollywood actors Brendan Fraser and Neve Campbell and Bollywood actors Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Vivek Oberoi . The Anglo-Indian historical romance is Bipasha Basu 's first English language film . She was encouraged to take up her international debut by Oscar-winning actress Hilary Swank . Basu first met up with Swank at the New Seven Wonders of the World Official Declaration ceremony convened in Lisbon in 2007 and met her again at the 2011 International Indian Film Academy Awards in Toronto . Though originally planned for shooting partly in the United Kingdom , production began in Queensland , Australia , on 8 November 2010 . It concluded there on the third week of December 2010 . The production then moved to India on 31 March 2011 for a further five weeks , roaming the rocky terrain of Chambal , Orchha and Gwalior in the state of Madhya Pradesh . Principal photography wrapped on 23 April 2011 . The film was planned to premiere at the 65th annual Cannes International Film Festival in May 2012 , but in late 2011 the production company was placed in administration and all further filming was stopped when some ten percent remained . In June 2012 , Belgian-based financing and production outfit Corsan agreed to put further money into the production , and the final scenes were to be shot in London . In September 2012 , it was reported that the filming in London was finished , while some creditors were still waiting for payment .
