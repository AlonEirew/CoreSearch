		GOLD_MENTION=devastating floods
		CONTEXT=December 1861 and January 1862 brought about devastating floods that placed the future of the city in doubt . In order to resolve the situation , the city residents agreed that additional levee construction was necessary . However , the city was divided between camps that supported a relatively small grading of a few feet to raise the city just above the rivers ' cresting levels and those that supported a substantial grading to accommodate basements in city businesses . In the upcoming election of 1863 , the level at which the city should be raised became a primary factor ; a candidate that supported high-level grading won , and high-level grading renovation proceeded . Earth was removed from a dangerous bend nearby the confluence of the two rivers and used to raise city blocks in 1868 ; the city 's sidewalks , until construction was finally finished , were uneven because neighbors of raised city blocks often remained at the pre-construction level . After the filled regions beneath buildings had settled , new streets had to be paved . While planking had been used in the past , newly raised streets chose either the smooth ( though indurable ) Nicolson pavement or the easily dirtied ( though durable ) cobblestone pavement . Grading and paving processes were fully completed by 1873 , leaving the first floors of many buildings at the time as basements and leaving second floors as new main floors . Today , this system of 19th-century basements is known as the Sacramento Underground

		CONTEXT=The flood was preceded by rains from March 9 that did not stop until March 22 , 1936 . The storms brought warmer 50 °F ( 10 °C ) weather that was a cause of one stage of flooding and the continuous rains a second cause of flooding . The natural run-off of 1 to 3 inches ( 2.5 to 7.5 cm ) was far surpassed by the deluge of from 10 to 30 inches ( 25 to 75 cm ) of water in the region . The flood came before pending flood control legislation was enacted or any significant flood control measures implemented . The narrowness of the valleys and encroachment of buildings on the river banks contributed to record flooding . By the time nightfall came one-third of the city was under of water and by the time flooding was over twenty-five people lost their lives . The damages , estimated at $ 43 million , made it the worst flood since the flood of 1889 and the event is chronicled at the Johnstown Flood Museum After the flood , sweeping nationwide flood control laws were enacted and from 1938 to 1943 Johnstown saw many projects completed . These measures gave the people the feeling that the area was now " flood free " , and it was touted as such until the flood of 1977

		GOLD_MENTION=mass murder
		CONTEXT=In 1988 , the party made '' The Next Step '' into a bulletin for its supporters . Later that year , a monthly magazine called '' Living Marxism '' was set up for a wider readership . Despite its beginnings as a far-left outlet , the politics espoused by the magazine developed a pronounced libertarianism . In December 1990 , '' Living Marxism '' ran an article which argued that the corrosive effect of the collapse of both Stalinism and reformism on the working class meant that " for the time being at least , the working class has no political existence " . In 1997 , the point was put more forcefully : In today 's circumstances class politics can not be reinvented , rebuilt , reinvigorated or rescued . Why ? Because any dynamic political outlook needs to exist in an interaction with existing individual consciousness . And contemporary forms of consciousness in our atomised societies can not be used as the foundation for a more developed politics of solidarity . Between 1990 and 1997 , the party developed the view that more than capitalism itself the danger facing humanity was the absence of a force for social change ( in philosophical language , a " subject " of history ) and the culture of low expectations that suppressed it . Prefacing a 1996 '' Living Marxism '' manifesto , Mick Hume argued : Of course ... we could have produced a familiar list of left-wing slogans complaining about problems like unemployment , exploitation and poverty which continue to scar our society . But that would be to ignore the transformation which has taken place in the political climate ... . At different times , different issues matter most . Each era has thrown up its own great questions which define which side you are on ... . A t '' Living Marxism '' , we see our job today as doing much more than criticising capitalism . That is the easy bit . There is a more pressing need to criticise the fatalistic critics , to counter the doom-mongers and put a positive case for human action in pursuit of social liberation . ... D ealing with ... unconventional questions , and puncturing the anti-human prejudices which surround them , is the precondition for making political action possible in our time . In February 1997 , shortly after the party disbanded , '' Living Marxism '' re-branded as '' LM '' , possibly to further distance itself from its leftist origins . Articles in '' LM '' argued : This magazine ran at least two articles in which the authors argued that the mass murder carried out in Rwanda in 1994 should not be described as genocide . In December 1995 , '' LM '' carried a report from an aid worker in Rwanda which argued : The lesson I would draw from my visit is that we must reject the term ' genocide ' in Rwanda . It has been used inside and outside Rwanda to criminalise the majority of ordinary Rwandan people , to justify outside interference in the country 's affairs , and to lend legitimacy to a minority military government imposed on Rwanda by Western powers . '' LM '' continued to create controversy on a variety of issues , most notably on the British Independent Television News ( ITN ) coverage of the Balkan conflict in the 1990s . The controversy centred on '' LM '' featuring an article by Thomas Deichmann in which he alleged that the ITN coverage of a refugee detention centre in Trnopolje during the conflict gave the false impression that the Bosnian Muslims were being held against their will in Serbian concentration camps . The ensuing libel award and costs arising from legal action by the ITN against '' LM '' were estimated to total around £ 1 million . The action bankrupted the magazine and its publishers

		GOLD_MENTION=2010 AFL Rising Star
		CONTEXT=He arrived at the club as an incredibly shy and underdeveloped personality , a fact that was noted by teammate Trent Cotchin who said though Martin was 18 “ he seemed much younger in some of the ways he behaved . ” Indeed , he struggled initially to adjust to the expectations of professional football . In one incident in the 2010 preseason he was removed from training and verbally reprimanded by club leadership when he was deemed unfit to train after a big night out . Despite these struggles , his on-field development was such that he would still debut in the 2010 season 's opening match , a 56-point Richmond loss against at the MCG . Martin recorded the sixth most disposals of any Tiger ( 18 ) to go along with four marks , three tackles and three clearances . Two weeks later Martin was convicted by the AFL tribunal for a high hit on Sydney 's Josh Kennedy in round 3 . He did not receive a suspension for the incident however , returning to football the following week . After four matches Martin ranked fourth in the league for clearances and eighth for hard-ball gets . Media reports emerged after round 8 that the 18 year old Martin had received a significant contract offer from expansion club the Greater Western Sydney Giants . The offer , which the Herald Sun ’s Mark Robinson claimed to be worth $ 2.4 million over three seasons , would have taken effect in the new club 's first AFL season in 2012 . Martin later said he had never entertained the idea of moving to the start-up club . In round 10 he had gained attention for his on-field efforts again , this time being nominated for the 2010 AFL Rising Star award after a 21 disposal and 11 clearance match against Port Adelaide . Due to his previous tribunal conviction however , Martin was ruled ineligible for the award and thus did not officially place in the end of season award 's points tally . He drew the attention of Sydney coach Paul Roos by round 14 , prompting Roos to send veteran Brett Kirk onto Martin in a tagging role . Despite this extra attention , he still managed to record 18 disposals and a goal in the match at the MCG . After 17 rounds Martin ranked second at the club for clearances and inside 50s as well as third for disposals and contested possessions . At the same time he ranked first among that season 's Rising Star nominees in clearances , contested possessions and inside 50s . He was also fourth for average disposals and fifth for average tackles . In round 19 he was rested by the club before returning to play out the final five matches of the season . He missed just that one game in his debut season and finished the year ranked second at Richmond for clearances and inside 50s , as well as third for both contested possessions and disposals . In addition to winning the Fred Swift Medal for fourth place at the club 's best and fairest night , Martin also received six votes in the Brownlow Medal count that year , the most by any Richmond debutant since Craig Lambert in 1988 . At season 's end he reiterated his commitment to the club ( and rejection of the former GWS overtures ) by signing a two-year contract extension that would keep him at Richmond until the end of the 2013 season . The extension was reported by the Herald Sun to be in the vicinity of $ 400,000-a-year

Representative Jane Harman called him " terrorist number one " , and '' Investor 's Business Daily '' called him " the world 's most dangerous man " . In July 2010 , the US Treasury Department added him to its list of Specially Designated Global Terrorists , and the UN added him to its list of individuals associated with al-Qaeda . In August 2010 , al-Awlaki 's father initiated a lawsuit against the US government with the American Civil Liberties Union , challenging its order to kill al-Awlaki .

		CONTEXT=Hunt starred in Woody Allen 's '' The Curse of the Jade Scorpion '' ( 2001 ) , as an efficiency expert hypnotized by a crooked hypnotist into stealing jewels . Despite the film 's limited success , Roger Ebert asserted : " Hunt in particular has fun with a wisecracking dame role that owes something , perhaps , to Rosalind Russell in '' His Girl Friday '' . " In 2003 , Hunt returned to Broadway in Yasmina Reza 's '' Life x 3 '' , and in 2004 , she starred in the drama '' A Good Woman '' , as a femme fatale in 1930s NYC . '' AV Club '' , in its review for the latter , remarked : " Helen Hunt looks embarrassingly out of place trying to play an infamous seductress " . She played a socialite , as part of an ensemble cast , in Emilio Estevez 's drama '' Bobby '' ( 2006 ) , about the hours leading up to the Robert F. Kennedy assassination . As a member of the cast , she was nominated for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Cast in a Motion Picture but won the Hollywood Film Festival Award for Best Ensemble Cast . Hunt made her feature film directorial debut in '' Then She Found Me '' ( 2007 ) , in which she also starred as a 39-year-old Brooklyn elementary school teacher , who after years is contacted by the flamboyant host of a local talk show , played by Bette Midler , who introduces herself as her biological mother . After first reading Elinor Lipman 's novel , she tried to interest numerous studios in the material , and her unsuccessful efforts led her to begin writing the screenplay and raising funds to produce it herself . Upon its release , Ruthe Stein of the '' San Francisco Chronicle '' observed , " You would think that frontloading '' Then She Found Me '' with so much plot would make it play like a soap opera . But Hunt saves the movie from this fate in two ways . First she turns in a touchingly real performance , the best of her big-screen career . Forget that '' As Good as It Gets '' won her an Oscar . She 's eons better and more realistic in this one ... By directing '' Then She Found Me '' , Helen becomes its savior as well ... Hunt knows when to rein in the Divine Miss M instead of allowing her to go into full Kabuki mode . She also coaxes pitch-perfect performances from Broderick and Firth . " Hunt starred in the dramedy '' Every Day '' ( 2010 ) , as one half of a married couple pulled apart by increasing responsibilities . According to '' Los Angeles Times '' , the film " comes as a reminder of Hunt 's talent for understatement , and a wish to see more of her " . In the biographical drama '' Soul Surfer '' ( 2011 ) , she played the mother of the Hawaiian-born champion surfer Bethany Hamilton , on whose life the film was based . Her first wide release since 2001 's '' The Curse of the Jade Scorpion '' , '' Soul Surfer '' made US$ 47.1 million internationally . Hunt starred as sex surrogate Cheryl Cohen-Greene in '' The Sessions '' ( 2012 ) , alongside John Hawkes and William H. Macy . The role required Hunt to perform multiple scenes of full-frontal nudity , on which she further said : " Being naked was challenging , but even more than that was the vulnerability . I felt vulnerable because I was naked . I felt vulnerable because we were having such a vulnerable moment in this character 's life . This was a real journey that someone had gone on , and I wanted to do right by that . " Her performance was acclaimed by critics and earned her several award nominations , including an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress . Todd McCarthy of '' The Hollywood Reporter '' wrote : " Hunt 's performance may be physically bold but is equally marked by its maturity and composure . " Hunt played research geneticist Mary-Claire King in the independent drama '' Decoding Annie Parker '' ( 2013 ) , which was released to a mixed critical response . She wrote and directed the drama '' Ride '' ( 2014 ) , in which she also starred as a mother who travels cross-country to California to be with her son after he decides to drop out of school and become a surfer . Rotten Tomatoes ' critical consensus read : " '' Ride '' reaffirms Helen Hunt 's immense acting talent — but suggests that she still needs time to develop as a director . " In '' The Miracle Season '' ( 2018 ) , based on the true story of the Iowa City West High School volleyball team , Hunt played Kathy Bresnahan , a volleyball coach

		GOLD_MENTION=1896 Sanriku earthquake
		CONTEXT=Slower than normal rupture propagation is associated with the presence of relatively mechanically weak material in the fault zone . This is particularly the case for some megathrust earthquakes , where the rupture velocity is about 1.0 km per second . These tsunami earthquakes are dangerous because most of the energy release happens at lower frequencies than normal earthquakes and they lack the peaks of seismic wave activity that would alert coastal populations to a possible tsunami risk . Typically the surface wave magnitude for such an event is much smaller than moment magnitude as the former does not capture the longer wavelength energy release . The 1896 Sanriku earthquake went almost unnoticed , but the associated tsunami killed more than 22,000 people

		CONTEXT=Famines became common in northern China in the early 17th century because of unusually dry and cold weather that shortened the growing season – effects of a larger ecological event now known as the Little Ice Age . Famine , alongside tax increases , widespread military desertions , a declining relief system , and natural disasters such as flooding and inability of the government to properly manage irrigation and flood-control projects caused widespread loss of life and normal civility . The central government , starved of resources , could do very little to mitigate the effects of these calamities . Making matters worse , a widespread epidemic spread across China from Zhejiang to Henan , killing an unknown but large number of people . The deadliest earthquake of all time , the Shaanxi earthquake of 1556 , occurred during the Jiajing Emperor 's reign , killing approximately 830,000 people

Already since the early summer of 1943 , German troops had been pouring into Greece , fearing an Allied landing there ( in fact falling victims to a grand-scale Allied strategic deception operation , " Operation Barclay " ) . Soon they became involved in wide-ranging counterguerrilla operations , which they carried out with great ruthlessness , based on their experiences in Yugoslavia . In the course of these operations , mass reprisals were carried out , resulting in war crimes such as at Kommeno on August 16 , the Massacre of Kalavryta in December and the Massacre of Distomo in June 1944 .

		GOLD_MENTION=purge of the military 's leadership
		CONTEXT=The Red Army 's focus on mobile operations in the early 1930s was gravely disrupted by Stalin 's purge of the military 's leadership . Since the new doctrines were associated with officers who had been declared enemies of the state , the support for them declined . Many large mechanised formations were disbanded , with the tanks distributed to support the infantry . After the German blitzkrieg proved its potency in Poland and France , the Red Army started a frantic effort to rebuild the large mechanised corps , but the task was only partly finished when the Wehrmacht attacked in 1941 . The huge tank forces , powerful only on paper , were mostly annihilated by the Germans in the first months of Operation Barbarossa . Another factor contributing to the initial defeat was that the Soviet post-World War I rearmament effort was started too early , and in 1941 the majority of Soviet equipment was obsolete and inferior to that of the Wehrmacht

		GOLD_MENTION=surge in political purges
		CONTEXT=There were numerous exiled German communists in Moscow , and they all used to report on one another to the Soviet authorities during the surge in political purges that accompanied growing political tensions domestically and internationally at this time . Such information demonstrated loyalty and was often blended with impressions or combined with denunciations . Hotropp himself provided a written report on Herwarth Walden , a fellow teacher at the Foreign Languages Institute who was later arrested . There was a perception that reports of this nature did not in themselves cause the authorities to arrest suspects , but they were certainly used by the NKVD where they provided evidential support for arrests that took place . Albert Hotopp 's own turn came on 31 May 1941 when he was arrested . On 1 August 1942 he was condemned to death . Available records are silent as to what happened next , but it is likely that he died shortly afterwards , probably in a Soviet labour camp . His wife Gertrud and their daughters were sent to continue their lives in Kazakhstan . His widow finally made her way back to East Germany in 1955 , after which she survived another thirty years . Albert Hotopp was formally rehabilitated by the Soviets in 1960

		GOLD_MENTION=Great Terror
		CONTEXT=The British historian A. J. P. Taylor wrote in 1945 that National Socialism was inevitable because the Germans wanted " to repudiate the equality with the peoples of ( central and ) eastern Europe which had then been forced upon them " after 1918 . Taylor wrote that : " During the preceding eighty years the Germans had sacrificed to the '' Reich '' all their liberties ; they demanded as a reward the enslavement of others . No German recognized the Czechs or Poles as equals . Therefore , every German desired the achievement which only total war could give . By no other means could the '' Reich '' be held together . It had been made by conquest and for conquest ; if it ever gave up its career of conquest , it would dissolve . " During Stalin 's Great Terror in the Soviet Union , the largest ethnic shooting and deportation operation , known as the Polish Operation , took place from about 25 August 1937 through 15 November 1938 . According to Soviet NKVD archives , 111,091 Poles , and people accused of ties with Poland , were executed , and 28,744 were sentenced to death-ridden labor camps , for a total of 139,835 Polish victims . This number constitutes 10 per cent of the officially persecuted persons during the entire Yezhovshchina period , with confirming NKVD documents . The coordinated actions of the Soviet NKVD and the Communist Party in 1937 – 1938 against the Polish minority living in the Soviet Union was a targeting of 0.4 percent of Soviet citizens by ethnicity . US historian Timothy D. Snyder says : " It is hard not to see the Soviet " Polish Operation " of 1937-38 as genocidal . " Simon Sebag Montefiore presents a similar opinion , Prof. Marek Jan Chodakiewicz , Dr. Tomasz Sommer , and others . In typical Stalinist fashion , the murdered Polish families were accused of " anti-Soviet " activities and state terrorism . Michael Ellman has said in the context of the UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide that Stalin 's Polish Operation " might well qualify as genocide " but because there has been no legal tribunal to try the crimes of Stalinism , there is no authoritative ruling on the legal characterisation

		GOLD_MENTION=Portella della Ginestra massacre
		CONTEXT=The changing economic landscape of Sicily shifted the Mafia 's power base from rural to the urban areas . The Minister of Agriculture – a communist – pushed for reforms in which peasants were to get larger shares of produce , be allowed to form cooperatives and take over badly used land , and remove the system by which leaseholders ( known as '' " gabelloti " '' ) could rent land from landowners for their own short-term use . Owners of especially large estates were to be forced to sell off some of their land . The Mafia had connections to many landowners and murdered many socialist reformers . The most notorious attack was the Portella della Ginestra massacre , when 11 people were killed and 33 wounded during May Day celebrations on May 1 , 1947 . The bloodbath was perpetrated by bandit Salvatore Giuliano who was possibly backed by local Mafia bosses . In the end , though , they were unable to stop the process , and many landowners chose to sell their land to mafiosi , who offered more money than the government

		CONTEXT=The Red Army 's focus on mobile operations in the early 1930s was gravely disrupted by Stalin 's purge of the military 's leadership . Since the new doctrines were associated with officers who had been declared enemies of the state , the support for them declined . Many large mechanised formations were disbanded , with the tanks distributed to support the infantry . After the German blitzkrieg proved its potency in Poland and France , the Red Army started a frantic effort to rebuild the large mechanised corps , but the task was only partly finished when the Wehrmacht attacked in 1941 . The huge tank forces , powerful only on paper , were mostly annihilated by the Germans in the first months of Operation Barbarossa . Another factor contributing to the initial defeat was that the Soviet post-World War I rearmament effort was started too early , and in 1941 the majority of Soviet equipment was obsolete and inferior to that of the Wehrmacht

" Sava noted that while the episode was humorous , much of the comedy was undercut by the tragic and distressing nature of Finn 's story . Andrew Tran of Overmental argued that " the episode ... dissects vividly that bottomless feeling of midlife wanderlust ... not the road-trippy , running-through-the-fields kind but rather the life-map-disappearing-in-your-hands , what-the-hell-is-next kind . " Tran contended that , through the use of video game tropes , explores the idea that life is ultimately unpredictable that there " is no map that you can make for yourself ( or that anyone can give you ) that can account for everything you ’re going to encounter " . " The Hall of Egress " has been highly lauded by the show 's production staff , with series creator Pendleton Ward in particular naming it as one of his favorites .

Shortly thereafter , as part of the accords concluding the Balkan Wars , Oraio and Western Thrace were ceded to Bulgaria and remained a part of the latter until the end of World War I . Following the Bulgarian defeat in this war , Western Thrace , and thus Oraio , was given to Greece in the second half of April 1920 at San Remo conference of the prime ministers of the main allies of the Entente powers ( except the US ) . Later in 1923 it was left to Greece with the rest of Western Thrace region by the Treaty of Lausanne . It was occupied by Bulgaria in the period 1941 – 1944 during World War II . Later in 1944 it was left to Greece .

		CONTEXT=104th Jäger Division was a German infantry division of World War II . It was formed in April 1943 , by the redesignation of the 704th Infantry Division , which was itself formed in April 1941 . The division served in Yugoslavia in May 1941 where it took part in anti-partisan and security operations in the Independent State of Croatia . In April 1943 , it was reorganized and redesignated the 104th Jäger Division and took part in the Battle of the Sutjeska in June 1943 . Following the Italian surrender , elements from the division took part in the murder of thousands of Italians from the 33 Infantry Division Acqui in September 1943 , on the Greek island of Cefalonia in one of the largest-scale German atrocities to be committed by German Army troops instead of the Waffen SS

		GOLD_MENTION=Massacre of Kalavryta
		CONTEXT=The Germans now took over the Italian zone , and soon proved to be a totally different opponent from the demoralized , war-weary and far less brutal Italians . Already since the early summer of 1943 , German troops had been pouring into Greece , fearing an Allied landing there ( in fact falling victims to a grand-scale Allied strategic deception operation , " Operation Barclay " ) . Soon they became involved in wide-ranging counterguerrilla operations , which they carried out with great ruthlessness , based on their experiences in Yugoslavia . In the course of these operations , mass reprisals were carried out , resulting in war crimes such as at Kommeno on August 16 , the Massacre of Kalavryta in December and the Massacre of Distomo in June 1944 . At the same time , hundreds of villages were systematically torched and almost one million people left homeless

		GOLD_MENTION=purge of the military 's leadership
		CONTEXT=The Red Army 's focus on mobile operations in the early 1930s was gravely disrupted by Stalin 's purge of the military 's leadership . Since the new doctrines were associated with officers who had been declared enemies of the state , the support for them declined . Many large mechanised formations were disbanded , with the tanks distributed to support the infantry . After the German blitzkrieg proved its potency in Poland and France , the Red Army started a frantic effort to rebuild the large mechanised corps , but the task was only partly finished when the Wehrmacht attacked in 1941 . The huge tank forces , powerful only on paper , were mostly annihilated by the Germans in the first months of Operation Barbarossa . Another factor contributing to the initial defeat was that the Soviet post-World War I rearmament effort was started too early , and in 1941 the majority of Soviet equipment was obsolete and inferior to that of the Wehrmacht

		CONTEXT=The 387th Rifle Division was raised in 1941 as an infantry division of the Red Army , and served for the duration of the Great Patriotic War in that role . It began forming on September 1 , 1941 in the Central Asia Military District . It first served in the winter counteroffensive south of Moscow , then spent the spring and summer of 1942 on the relatively quiet fronts southwest of the capital in the area of Kaluga and Tula . In September it was withdrawn to the Reserve of the Supreme High Command where it joined the 1st Reserve Army . This became the 2nd Guards Army and the division fought south of Stalingrad against Army Group Don during the German attempt to relieve their encircled 6th Army in December . During January and into February , 1943 , 2nd Guards advanced on both sides of the lower Don River towards Rostov in a race to prevent Army Group A from escaping being trapped in the Caucasus region . The division was now part of Southern Front and it would remain in that Front ( later 4th Ukrainian ) until May , 1944 . During the summer advance through the Donbass and southern Ukraine the 387th served under several different army commands before returning to 2nd Guards for the Crimean Offensive in April , 1944 , during which it won a battle honor . After the Crimea was cleared the division remained there as part of the Separate Coastal Army until it went back to the Reserve in March , 1945 . It then was assigned to the 2nd Ukrainian Front as a separate rifle division , and spent the last weeks of the war in Hungary and Austria . It continued to serve briefly into the postwar period .

		CONTEXT=Around the early 16th century , following the construction of the Ribeira Palace beside the Tagus river , the Palace of Alcáçova began to lose its importance . An earthquake occurring in 1531 further damaged the old castle , contributing further to its decay and neglect . In 1569 , King Sebastian ordered the rebuilding of the royal apartments in the castle , intending to use it as his official residence . As part of the rebuilding , in 1577 Filippo Terzi demolished one of the towers near the principal facade of the Church of Loreto . However , many of the works were never completed after the young king 's apparent death during the Battle of Alcácer Quibir . The following Portuguese dynastic crisis opened the way for sixty years of Spanish rule and the castle was converted into military barracks and a prison . On 30 December 1642 , Teodósio de Frias the Younger was appointed master builder to continue the works begun by his father , Luís de Frias , and his grandfather , Teodósio de Frias . This was part of a greater plan by the Spanish forces to recommission the fortification . However , after Portugal regained its independence following the Portuguese Restoration War , the works were taken over by the Portuguese government . On 6 November 1648 , Nicolau de Langres was called upon to take over the design , execution and construction of a new fortification that would surround the Castle of São Jorge and the city walls of Lisbon . In 1650 the military architect Mateus do Couto was named master builder of the project and reconstruction took on a new formality : although the military engineer João Gillot built new walls in 1652 , construction again followed Couto 's plans between 1657 and 1733 . In 1673 , the Soldiers ' Hospital , dedicated to '' São João de Deus '' ( St John of God ) , was installed on the grounds beside the Rua do Recolhimento . At the end of the 17th century the '' Recolhimento do Castelo '' ( " Castle Shelter " ) was constructed along the southeast angle of the courtyard , and in 1733 , new projects were initiated by master Custódio Vieira

The commercial success of '' The Marriage of Maria Braun '' strengthened the negotiation position of Fassbinder in his subsequent film projects . He received a financing agreement for one of his favorite projects based on Pitigrilli 's novel '' Cocaine '' and was able to increase the budget for '' Berlin Alexanderplatz '' . Several German commercial film producers expressed an interest in making films with Fassbinder . The seasoned film producer Luggi Waldleitner would produce the Fassbinder film '' Lili Marleen '' with Hanna Schygulla in the main role . Horst Wendlandt would produce the two other films in the BRD Trilogy , '' Lola '' and '' Veronika Voss '' .

		CONTEXT=Invented in 2009 , the BSB achieves high energy efficiency and carbon reduction primarily through thermal insulation , preventing cool air from leaving indoors and hot air from coming in from outdoors when the weather is hot and vice versa when the weather is cold , and requires short construction time since parts are pre-fabricated in factories and assembled onsite . At the 2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference , President of Mexico , Felipe Calderón , called the BSB technology " a practical , imaginative , creative & bold endeavor '' and '' a new revolution of world 's architectural and housing industry " , which is bound to be transferred to developing countries leading to reduction in carbon emissions . BSB has also been tested to be able to resist a 9.0 magnitude earthquake and was recommended in a United Nations Environment Program report on the rebuilding of Sichuan after its catastrophic earthquake in 2008

		CONTEXT=The Earth Summits are decennial meetings of world leaders , organized since 1972 with help of the United Nations , to help defining ways to stimulate sustainable development at the global level . The aim is to bring together the best individuals and organisations humanity can bring forward from all kind of categories of life , to identify and update what are humanity 's most pressing challenges , to quantify them , identify solutions and develop a plan of action not to run into a wall . This plan of action is called Agenda 21 and implemented by many local governments under the name Local Agenda 21 . The plan of action is designed as a TQM - Total Quality Manual , designed smartly and open enough , so that also organisations , companies and individuals can use it as a basis for their own plan of action and guidance not to miss out on important issue ; it helps speed up understanding and identifying partners by e.g. using similar wordings and symbols . The 2000 - 2015 Millennium Development Goals and the 2015 - 2030 Global Goals are results from these Earth Summits . The first summit took place in Stockholm ( [ Sweden ] ) in 1972 , the second in Nairobi ( Kenya ) in 1982 , the third in Rio de Janeiro ( Brazil ) in 1992 and the fourth in Johannesburg ( South Africa ) in 2002 .

		CONTEXT=The reduction of carbon emissions , along with other greenhouse gases ( GHGs ) , has become a vitally important task of international , national and local actors . If we understand governance as the creation of “ conditions for ordered rule and collective action ” then , given the fact that the reduction of carbon emissions will require concerted collective action , it follows that the governance of carbon will be of paramount concern . We have seen numerous international conferences over the past 20 years tasked with finding a way of facilitating this , and while international agreements have been infamously difficult to reach , action at the national level has been much more effective . In the UK , the Climate Change Act 2008 committed the government to meeting significant carbon reduction targets . In England , these carbon emissions are governed using numerous different instruments , which involve a variety of actors . While it has been argued by authors like Rhodes that there has been a “ hollowing out ” of the nation state , and that governments have lost their capabilities to govern to a variety of non-state actors and the European Union , the case of carbon governance in England actually runs counter to this . The government body responsible for the task , the Department of Energy and Climate Change ( DECC ) , is the “ main external dynamic ” behind governing actions in this area , and “ rather than hollowing out ( there has actually been a strengthening of ) central co-ordination ” . The department may rely on other bodies to deliver its desired outcomes , but it is still ultimately responsible for the imposition of the rules and regulations that “ steer ( carbon ) governmental action at the national level ” . It is therefore evident that carbon governance in England is hierarchical in nature , in that “ legislative decisions and executive decisions ” are the main dynamic behind carbon governance action . This does not deny the existence of a network of bodies around DECC who are part of the process , but they are supplementary actors who are steered by central decisions . This article focuses on carbon governance in England as the other countries of the UK ( Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland ) all have devolved assemblies who are responsible for the governance of carbon emissions in their respective countries .

		CONTEXT=Chinese Premier Hu Jintao showed China 's willingness to be a positive partner in global development when he showed China 's meteoric rise in saying : " The scale and complexity of the challenges that we face in the course of development are unmatched anywhere else in the world and have been rarely seen in human history . We must make persistent efforts for a long time to come . The Chinese people suffered so much in modern history , and we therefore value peace , stability , harmony and freedom more than anything else . A prosperous and growing China dedicated to peace and cooperation is willing and able to make new and even greater contribution to mankind 's pursuit of peace and development . " India took the initiative to call for improving the importance of the BRIC and IBSA groups . Indian PM Singh also called for closer cooperation in the fields of energy and food security , as well as tapping into the potential of other sectors such as trade and investment , science and technology and infrastructure . He added that pooling together the experiences of each can lead to more inclusive growth . " We are four large countries with abundant resources , large populations and diverse societies ... We aspire for rapid growth for ourselves and for an external environment that is conducive to our development goals . Our people expect us to work together so as to bring the benefits of inclusive social and economic development to them . Our grouping includes two of the largest energy producers and two of the largest consumers in the world . We can cooperate in both upstream and downstream areas , and in the development of new fuels and clean energy technologies . " The Chinese president , Hu Jintao , brought forward his departure to April 15 ( before the actual talks ) instead of April 17 due to the earthquake in Qinghai .

		CONTEXT=The total population of children in Ghana under the age of 15 is 38.01 % . The youth constitute the most important human resource potential that can contribute significantly to the overall development of a nation . The idea of children on the streets violates the children 's act which states that under no circumstance should a person below the age of fifteen be allowed to work or fend for him or herself . Therefore , the increasing phenomenon of street - ism is a menace . The street children are viewed worldly as problem ( because some of them steal to survive ) rather than people whose first habitat is the street . Obviously , extreme deprivation and social exclusion create opportunities for engaging in crime . Street children are among the most physically visible of all children , living and working on various street corners and public squares in our cities ranging from Aflao to Bawku . Ironically , they are also among the most ' invisible ' , considering that they are the most difficult groups to reach with provision of vital services such as education and healthcare , and thus the hardest to protect . Once on the street , aside being exposed to the mercy of the weather , they are vulnerable to all forms of exploitation and abuse , a life far removed from the childhood envisioned in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child . Street children represent one of the most marginalized groups of children worldwide . They face multiple deprivation of their rights on a daily basis .

		GOLD_MENTION=1992 Eurovision Song Contest
		CONTEXT=Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny appears at his back door in his boxers and invites viewers for a look around his house ; including a ( now fully dressed ) encounter with his karaoke machine . He then sets off on his bicycle for an interview at RTÉ . Alas his attempts to get there unscathed come undone when his bike receives a puncture and he has to resort to queueing for a bus like the common person . When the bus arrives , he realises he has no money but after asking for some spare cash from an innocent bystander , he turns around to find the bus has pulled off again . In the RTÉ carpark , Pat Kenny sits in his car , casting his eyes over his fellow broadcasters and enviously longing to join them in their casual conversation . When he finally plucks up the courage to approach Marian Finucane and Joe Duffy , the latter is overheard insulting him and Pat heads back to his car . With Pat due on air in ten minutes , Tom decides to join him in the passenger seat but he must first overcome the clutches of George Hook , who once again attempts to lure him to Newstalk . Pat asks Tom what the world really thinks of him , believing that his assistant is the only person in the world who is loyal to him . Tom attempts to avoid the question , distracting Pat by ( wrongly ) telling him that Enda Kenny has just arrived . Eventually Tom opts to tell Pat , albeit with much hesitation , that he is '' " absolutely unbelievable " '' . At that moment Enda Kenny finally arrives at the studio , still in his biker gear and collapses with exhaustion on the steps having raced through Dublin to make the interview on schedule . Kenny and Kenny square off on air and , with Pat faced with an adversary so similar in perceived personality , popularity and name he is even more unable to cope with his feelings of unworthiness than usual . Pat breaks down live on air , mistaking Enda 's rival , Taoiseach Bertie Ahern , for his own rival , '' Liveline '' presenter Joe Duffy . This prompts Enda to join him in his moment of unrelenting emotion . The next morning Tom arrives at Pat 's house . Pat assumes he has come with his P45 or details of who is to take over the mantle of the station 's highest earning broadcaster . However Tom merely points to two giant sacks of complimentary mail he has carried on his bike from RTÉ headquarters . One of them even wants to sleep with the presenter , who quickly places the letter in the left front pocket of his dressing gown . Pat is astounded to discover he is all over the news and that celebrities such as 1992 Eurovision Song Contest winner Linda Martin , music mogul Louis Walsh and Boyzone lead singer Ronan Keating are talking about him . He hurries indoors to switch on his television . There he finds that figures from the worlds of sport and politics including Irish national football team manager Steve Staunton , Ireland rugby manager Eddie O'Sullivan and Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams are lining up in their droves to pay tribute to him . He is intrigued to find Fintan O'Toole has also spoken greatly of him but becomes irritated when he finds that Steve Staunton seems to have taken over the airwaves , typically reiterating how Pat has done a great job , how he works for the team , has delivered a great result and what else can you say . Meanwhile , Bertie Ahern repeatedly rings Tom 's mobile to request an interview with Pat , but on each occasion Tom tells him to ring back later . Pat and Tom stroll into RTÉ , where George Hook is astounded to hear of Pat 's newfound popularity . He is adamant that Tom will soon join him at Newstalk but Tom shows his unswaying loyalty by declaring he will go only where Pat goes . On Friday night George slips into RTÉ and just as an episode of '' The Late Late Show '' is coming to a close , approaches Pat 's dressing room . George is inadvertently knocked to the floor by a stray microphone where he lies moaning until Pat emerges from the dressing room . Pat steps over George and leaves RTÉ with Tom , telling his assistant that he should not allow anyone to undermine him before demanding that he open the door

		CONTEXT=Laberinto de Fortuna ( Labyrinth of Fortune ) is the major work of Juan de Mena , who completed the poem in 1444 . It is an epic poem written in " arte mayor " ( verses of 12 syllables ) . Though the title implies an examination of Fortune , the work is essentially a propagandistic piece in favor of Castilian political unity behind Álvaro de Luna , the court favorite of King Juan II of Castilla . It includes considerable social satire criticizing corrupt nobles and urging the king to take action against them . The Labyrinth was much read during the 15th and 16th centuries , although its linguistic and structural complexity led to the publication of a " glossed " version ( in which explanatory notes follow each stanza ) in 1499 . The work is also known as Las treszientas ( The Three - hundred ) because it consists of 300 stanzas ( although some manuscripts include only 297 ) .

		CONTEXT=The jazz orchestra dancing in Scandinavia was interrupted by the counterculture of the 1960s , whose influences of left-wing politics and LSD were altering the shape of popular music around the world . In 1967 the first psychedelic and progressive rock groups emerged in Stockholm 's Filips club , including Hansson & Karlsson , the Baby Grandmothers , and Mecki Mark Men . These groups were very popular in the Sweden of the late 60s , with television appearances , sold-out concerts , and tours around Europe . Mecki Mark Men even spent three months in the U.S. where they played big rock music festivals with Sly and the Family Stone , Jethro Tull , Pentangle , Mountain , Grand Funk Railroad , Paul Butterfield , and The Byrds . Aside from this music that blended rock , jazz , and folk music with improvisation and experimentation , Swedish progressive rock , or " progg " as it became known , was also fiercely political . Progg bands would go on to support efforts against war and nuclear power , or protest competitive events like Eurovision , stating , " Music can not be a contest . " The term " dansband " was coined around 1970 , when Swedish popular music developed a signature style with brightly characterized lyrics and catchy melodies . The following decade became the golden era of dansband music , with groups like Thorleifs , Flamingokvintetten , Ingmar Nordströms , Wizex and Matz Bladhs rising to popularity in Sweden . In 1977 , the song " Beatles " , performed by Swedish dansband Forbes , won the Swedish Melodifestivalen 1977 and finished 18th ( last ) in the Eurovision Song Contest 1977

		CONTEXT=After the commercial lackluster of her eighth studio album , '' Britney Jean '' ( 2013 ) , Spears started her Las Vegas residency show , Britney : Piece of Me , which attained commercial success . Later , in September 2014 , Spears posted a picture of herself in the studio , hinting that she was recording new music . In another interview , a month later , she revealed that she was working " very slowly , but progressively " on the album . In 2015 , she released the song " Pretty Girls " with Iggy Azalea , however the song was met with moderate impact and Spears headed back to the studio to record more songs , but did n't have plans to release a new album . In November 2015 , Spears teased on her Instagram account that she was working with songwriters Justin Tranter and Julia Michaels , by posting a picture of them looking " bemused " with the caption : " Working hard and hardly working ... new album ... wheeeee ! . " A month later , Tranter gave an interview for website NewNowNext about his work with Spears and commented : " Working with Britney is a fucking dream . She is so sweet , so inspiring and a master on the mic . Me and Julia had to leave the studio one day because our screams of excitement after every take she did were distracting the producers . " In late 2016 , during interviews to promote the album , Spears declared that she wanted to explore new things on the record , and that it was her " most hip-hop album , " explaining : " ... there are like two or three songs that go in the direction of more urban that I 've wanted to do for a long time now , and I just have n't really done that . " In May 2016 , in an exclusive interview for website '' Breathe Heavy '' , Tranter revealed : " Nobody ever talks about Britney as a writer and she ’s f " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " was written by Mattias Larsson , Robin Fredriksson , Julia Michaels , Justin Tranter and Sandy Chila , with production being done by Mattman & Robin . Mattman & Robin were also responsible for programming , drums , percussion , snaps , handclaps , synths , guitars , bass and kalimba , while Michaels and Jermaine Jackson provided background vocals . It was recorded at 158 Studios , Westlake Village , California , The Studio at the Palms , Las Vegas , Nevada , and at Wolf Cousins Studios , Stockholm , Sweden . " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is an electropop , and dance-pop song that lasts for three minutes and twenty-two seconds ( 3:22 ) . It features " subtle keyboards , a strummed guitar , " and " wobbly bass " in its instrumentation . For Brian Josephs of '' Spin '' , the song 's guitar slaps " recall her 2001 single ' I 'm a Slave 4 U. ' " Other critics also felt that the " strummed flamenco guitar " on the song is similar to those on Justin Timberlake 's " Like I Love You " . Bianca Gracie of '' Fuse '' opined that the song reminded her of " the glory days ( no pun intended ) of ' Circus ' and ' Femme Fatale ' . " Lyrically , " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is a flirty song about Spears " offer ing several reasons why her lover should come over and options , which can be seen in the lines " Nobody should be alone if they do n't have to be " and " I could get into that kissin ' and touchin ' / Or we could be good and do next to nothin ' . " Amy Roberts of '' Bustle '' noted that the lyrics are about hooking up , adding that they " celebrate the idea that casual relationships do n't need to be lacking respect or understanding . You do n't have to be in love with , or committing to , the person that you 're hooking up with , but that also does n't mean that you ca n't connect with them on a different level than just sex . In fact , Spears makes it clear that it 's kind of even cool if her hook-up does n't want to have sex . Her partner can draw the boundaries of where the massage she 's offering starts and ends , and if it remains as nothing more than a back rub then so be it – that 's totally cool . " For Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine , the song features " some dubious lyrics that seem to suggest masturbatory self-love " in the lines : " All I want is what you want/And all you want is me . " The chorus of the song features " a shouted gang " of backup singers , singing : " Whatever you want / whatever you need / I 'll do it ! . " Lewis Corner of Digital Spy called it " a thumping pop anthem , " praising " Britney 's seductive vocal delivery . " Gil Kaufman of '' Billboard '' named it a " fun , flirty " track . Bianca Gracie of '' Fuse '' described it as a " pulsating track that is a flirty booty call that is bound to own the dance floor . " Robbie Daw of Idolator found it to be " a traditional Spears-style chunk of dance-pop " and " arguably the best yet , with its thick whomping bass and that sparkling ' nobody should be alone if they do n't have to be ' breakdown . " Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine called it " impeccably produced downstairs music , " adding that it " is an irresistible slice of dance-pop , with an ebullient bassline and staccato acoustic guitar . " Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic declared that " some of the highlights on the album are the silliest songs , " citing " Do You Wan na Come Over " 's " overheated flamenco chorus " as an example . Maura Johnston of '' Boston Globe '' said the song was one of the album 's high points , noting that the song " is jolted to life by the slashed guitars that helped make ' Toxic ' a pop thrill . " John Murphy of musicOMH was positive while noting that the track " has a rush and urgency about it which marks it out as one of the album 's best songs . " Nolan Feeney of '' Entertainment Weekly '' also picked it as a highlight , praising the " acoustic guitars and gurgling bass lines that make for one freaky pop experiment . " Alex Macpherson of '' The Guardian '' wrote that the song " takes the party back to Britney 's heyday , " praising the inclusion of the flamenco guitar . For '' Los Angeles Times '' writer Mikael Wood , the song " restore s some of the sonic invention that once defined Spears ' biggest hits . " Nick Levine , writing for '' NME '' , echoed the same thought , writing : " The lusty strut of ‘ Do You Wan na Come Over ? ’ nods to her early-noughties Neptunes-produced hits . " In his Vice column , Robert Christgau selected " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " and " Clumsy " as his favorite tracks on the album . Amy Mackelden of '' Bustle '' elaborated about the track : With a strong '90s vibe , an upbeat tempo , and a surprising rhythm , " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " utilizes the best of Spears ' talents . ... " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " embraces the current trend for songs that are musically complicated , that layer up their beats and sound effects , and feature multiple voices and infectious shouting during their choruses . Much like Hailee Steinfeld and Gwen Stefani 's latest offerings , " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is melodic , has a fast tempo , and is instantly recognizable . And most importantly , it 's fun . On August 18 , 2016 , Spears added " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " , as well as " Make Me ... " , to the setlist of her Las Vegas residency show Britney : Piece of Me . Later , on September 1 , 2016 , a performance of the song was broadcast from Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas for Today . During the performance , she used " an outfit similar to her risqué costume from 2016 's VMAs , while her backup dancers stood out in brightly-colored tank tops and shorts , " as reported by '' Entertainment Weekly '' Ruth Kinane . The song was also included in Spears 's setlist for the iHeartRadio Music Festival on September 24 , 2016 . Spears also performed it at I Heart Radio Jingle Ball , Triple Show and B26 Pepsi Jingle Bash during December 2016 . Also performed it at Apple Music Festival which was held in United Kingdom

On May 27 , 2014 Cyrus performed the song during the World Music Awards held in Monte Carlo , Monaco ; where she also won four World Music Awards .

Cyrus has performed the song during her ongoing Bangerz Tour . A critic from the '' Nashville Scene '' praised the performance , writing , " Wrecking Ball was sung by Miley and earnestly shouted in unison by the arena , some of the audience tearing up . " Blake Hannon praised Cyrus ' vocal delivery , writing , " The crowd kept going when things slowed down for Wrecking Ball . It was the highlight of the night , and not because of anything visual . The costumed characters vanished and the screen was black , with Cyrus belting out one of the best pop power ballads in recent memory with only a smattering of lights .

		CONTEXT=After the failure of the 1921 Syrian revolt that he led , al-Qassam escaped to Haifa . According to Shai Lachman , between 1921 and 1935 al-Qassam often cooperated with Mufti of Jerusalem Mohammad Amin al-Husayni . They were on good terms , and al-Qassam 's various official appointments required the mufti 's prior consent . He suggests their cooperation increased after the 1929 riots , in which one source claims al-Qassam 's men were active . The two fell out in the mid-thirties , perhaps due to al-Qassam 's independent line of activism . When the Mufti rejected his plans to divert funding marked for mosque repairs for the purchase of weaponry , Qassam found support in the Arab Nationalist Istiqlal Party . Qassam continued his attempts to forge an alliance with the Mufti in order to attack the British . He was not successful for the Mufti , who headed the Supreme Muslim Council , was still committed to a diplomatic approach at the time . Qassam went ahead with his plans to attack the British on his own

		GOLD_MENTION=Stalinist terror
		CONTEXT=The crux of Nolte 's thesis was presented when he wrote : " It is a notable shortcoming of the literature about National Socialism that it does not know or does not want to admit to what degree all the deeds — with the sole exception of the technical process of gassing — that the National Socialists later committed had already been described in a voluminous literature of the early 1920s : mass deportations and shootings , torture , death camps , extermination of entire groups using strictly objective selection criteria , and public demands for the annihilation of millions of guiltless people who were thought to be " enemies " . It is probable that many of these reports were exaggerated . It is certain that the “ White Terror ” also committed terrible deeds , even though its program contained no analogy to the “ extermination of the bourgeoisie ” . Nonetheless , the following question must seem permissible , even unavoidable : Did the National Socialists or Hitler perhaps commit an “ Asiatic ” deed merely because they and their ilk considered themselves to be the potential victims of an “ Asiatic ” deed ? Was n’t the ' Gulag Archipelago ' more original than Auschwitz ? Was the Bolshevik murder of an entire class not the logical and factual '' prius '' of the " racial murder " of National Socialism ? Can not Hitler 's most secret deeds be explained by the fact that he had '' not '' forgotten the rat cage ? Did Auschwitz in its root causes not originate in a past that would not pass ? " Nolte wrote the principle problem " for the coming generations ... must be liberation from collectivist thinking " , which Nolte claimed dominated scholarship on Nazi Germany . Nolte ended his essay with calling for a " more comprehensive debate " about the memory of Nazi Germany that would allow for " the past that will not go away " to finally go away " as is suitable for every past " . Nolte subsequently presented a 1940 book by American author Theodore N. Kaufman entitled '' Germany Must Perish ! '' . The text contends that all German men should be sterilized , evidencing , according to Nolte , the alleged " Jewish " desire to " annihilate " Germans prior to the Holocaust . An August 1941 appeal to the world by a group of Soviet Jews seeking support against Germany was also cited by Nolte as evidence of Jewish determination to thwart the '' Reich '' . Nolte argued that the Nazis felt forced to undertake the Holocaust by Hitler 's conclusion that the entire Jewish population of the world had declared war on Germany . From Nolte 's point of view , the Holocaust was an act of “ Asiatic barbarism ” forced on the Germans by the fear of what Joseph Stalin , whom Nolte believed to have significant Jewish support , might do to them . Nolte contends that the U.S. internment of Japanese Americans in the wake of the Pearl Harbor attack provides a parallel to the German " internment " of the Jewish population of Europe in concentration camps , in light of what Nolte alleges was the " Jewish " declaration of war on Germany in 1939 which Weizmann 's letter allegedly constitutes . Subsequently , Nolte expanded upon these views in his 1987 book '' Der europäische Bürgerkrieg , 1917 – 1945 '' ( '' The European Civil War , 1917 – 1945 '' ) in which he claimed that the entire 20th century was an age of genocide , totalitarianism , and tyranny , and that the Holocaust had been merely one chapter in the age of violence , terror and population displacement . Nolte claimed that this age had started with the genocide of the Armenians during World War I , and also included the Stalinist terror in the Soviet Union , the expulsion of ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe , Maoist terror in China as manifested in such events as the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution , compulsory population exchanges between Greece and Turkey from 1922 to 1923 , American war crimes in the Vietnam War , the Khmer Rouge genocide in Cambodia , and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan . In particular , Nolte argued that the expulsion of ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe in 1945 – 46 was " to be categorized ... under the concept of genocide " . As part of this argument , Nolte cited the 1979 book of the American historian Alfred-Maurice de Zayas , '' Die Wehrmacht Untersuchungsstelle '' , which argues that the Allies were just as guilty of war crimes as the Germans as the " happy evidence of the will to objectivity on the part of a foreigner " In Nolte 's opinion , Hitler was a " European citizen " who fought in defence of the values of the West against " Asiatic " Bolshevism , but due to his " total egocentrism " waged this struggle with unnecessary violence and brutality Since in Nolte 's view , the '' Shoah '' was not a unique crime , there is no reason to single out Germans for special criticism for the Holocaust . In addition , Nolte sees his work as the beginning of a much-needed revisionist treatment to end the " negative myth " of the Third Reich that dominates contemporary perceptions . Nolte took the view that the principle problem of German history was this “ negative myth ” of the Third Reich , which cast the Nazi era as the '' ne plus ultra '' of evil . Nolte wrote that after the American Civil War , the defeated South was cast as the symbol of total evil by the victorious North , but later “ revisionism ” became the dominant historical interpretation against the “ negative myth ” of the South , which led to a more balanced history of the Civil War with a greater understanding of the “ motives and way of life of the defeated Southern states ” , and led to the leaders of the Confederacy becoming great American heroes . Nolte urged that a similar “ revisionism ” destroy the “ negative myth ” of the Third Reich . Nolte argued that the Vietnam War , the Khmer Rouge genocide , the expulsion of " boat people " from Vietnam , the Islamic revolution in Iran , and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan meant the traditional picture of Nazi Germany as the ultimate in evil was no longer tenable , and proved the need for " revisionism " to put an end to the " negative myth " of the Third Reich . In Nolte 's view , the first efforts at revisionism of the Nazi period failed because A. J. P. Taylor 's 1961 book '' The Origins of the Second World War '' was only a part of the " anti-German literature of indictment " while David Hoggan in '' Der erzwugnene Krieg '' , by only seeking to examine why World War II broke out in 1939 , " cut himself off from the really decisive questions " . Then the next revisionist efforts Nolte cites were the Italian historian Domenico Settembrini 's favorable treatment of Fascism for saving Italy from Communism , and the British historian Timothy Mason 's studies in working class German history . The best of the revisionists according to Nolte is David Irving , with whom Nolte finds some fault , although " not all of Irving 's theses and points can be dismissed with such ease " . Nolte praises Irving as the first to understand that Weizmann 's letter to Chamberlain was a " Jewish declaration of war " on Germany that justified the " interning " of the Jews of Europe . Nolte went on to praise Irving for putting the Holocaust " in a more comprehensive perspective " by comparing it to the British fire-bombing of Hamburg in 1943 , which Nolte views as just much of an act of genocide as the " Final Solution " . The sort of revisionism needed to end the " negative myth " of the Third Reich is , in Nolte 's opinion , an examination of the impact of the Russian Revolution on Germany

		GOLD_MENTION=3rd Moscow International Film Festival
		CONTEXT=The first feature film Ján Kadár and Elmar Klos were able to make in five years showed a decided return to classical black-and-white filmmaking with barely a trace of Kadár 's more experimental work at the '' Laterna magika '' . A gradual relaxation of communist control in Czechoslovakia , whose first signs came from Slovakia , enabled the Bratislava journalist and writer Ladislav Mňačko to publish his novel '' Death Is Called Engelchen '' ( '' Smrť sa volá Engelchen '' , 1959 ) and Kadár and Klos to reach for it from Prague after their suspension was over . The novel and their film '' Death is Called Engelchen '' ( , , 1963 ) spotlighted a new take on the massive pro-democratic Slovak revolt of 1944 that had previously been portrayed only as invariably glorious . It showed some of its aspects that brought about human tragedy . The film was entered into the 3rd Moscow International Film Festival where it won a Golden Prize . The directors ' next film , '' Accused '' aka '' Defendant '' ( '' Obžalovaný '' , 1964 ) , rehashed the propagandist structures of the earlier Socialist-Realist filmmaking , but turned them around by replacing the content mandated in the 1950s with committed social criticism that was quickly becoming one of the hallmarks of Slovak and Czech cinema of the 1960s

		CONTEXT=The ceremony was held on a night other than Sunday for the first time since 1976 ( the 28th Primetime Emmy Awards were also staged on a Monday that year , May 17 ) . The ceremony 's unusual date — a Monday night in late August — was due to two factors , primary being NBC 's commitment to '' Sunday Night Football '' ; since acquiring the National Football League 's Sunday night game package in 2006 , NBC , when it is their turn in the four-network rotation to air the Primetime Emmy Awards , usually schedules the ceremony for the Sunday before Labor Day weekend , to avoid conflicts with '' SNF '' in mid-September ( when ABC , CBS , or Fox normally air the ceremony ) . NBC 's ideal date on the 2014 calendar for the ceremony ( Sunday , August 24 ) led to the other scheduling factor — MTV 's Video Music Awards , which were set for that night more than a year in advance ( and would be staged in the L.A. area as well , at The Forum in Inglewood ) . On January 28 , 2014 , rather than go head-to-head with the VMA 's , NBC announced that the ceremony would take place on Monday , August 25 . The move would allow NBC to commit to a preseason '' Sunday Night Football '' broadcast for the 24th ( a game between the Cincinnati Bengals and Arizona Cardinals ) ; it also ensured the tradition of staging the Primetime Emmy Awards the weekend after the Creative Arts Emmy Awards ( that ceremony was already set for August 16 )

		GOLD_MENTION=first Republican National Convention
		CONTEXT=The first official Republican convention in Illinois was held on May 29 , 1856 , in Bloomington . Chairman John M. Palmer was elected convention president after his opening address . Nine vice presidents and five secretaries were then elected . The convention nominated Bissell for governor with Francis Hoffmann as lieutenant governor , Ozias M. Hatch for secretary of state , Jesse K. Dubois as auditor , and James Miller as treasurer . Hoffmann was found to be ineligible for his position due to a residency requirement , and John Wood was nominated in his place . The following resolutions defining the party platform were approved : Resolved , That foregoing all former differences of opinions upon other questions , we pledge ourselves to unite in opposition to the present administration and to the party which upholds and supports it and to use all honorable and constitutional means to wrest the Government from the unworthy hands which now control it and to bring it back in its administration to the principles and practices of Washington , Jefferson and their great and good compatriots of the Revolution . Resolved , That foregoing all former differences of opinions upon other questions , we pledge ourselves to unite in opposition to the present administration of the Government ; that under the Constitution Congress possesses the power to prohibit slavery in the Territories ; and that , whilst we will maintain all constitutional rights of the South , we also hold that justice , humanity , the principles of freedom as expressed in our Declaration of Independence and our national constitution , and the purity and perpetuity of our Government require that that power shall be exerted to prevent the extension of slavery into territory heretofore free . Resolved , That the repeal of the Missouri Compromise was unwise and injurious ; an open and aggravated violation of the plighted faith of the States , and that the attempt of the present administration to force slavery into Kansas against the known wishes of the legal voters of that Territory is an arbitrary and tyrannous violation of the rights of the people to govern themselves , and that we will strive by all constitutional means to secure to Kansas and Nebraska the legal guaranty against slavery of which they were deprived at the cost of the violation of the plighted faith of the nation . Resolved , That we are devoted to the Union and will , to the last extremity , defend it against the efforts now being made by the dis-unionists of this administration to compass its dissolution , and that we will support the Constitution of the United States , in all its provisions regarding it , as the sacred bond of our Union and the only safeguard for the preservation of the rights of ourselves and our posterity . Resolved , That we are in favor of the immediate admission of Kansas as a member of this Confederacy under the constitution adopted by the people of said Territory . Resolved , That the spirit of our institutions as well as the Constitution of our country , guarantees the liberty of conscience as well as political freedom , and that we will proscribe no one by legislation or otherwise on account of religious opinions , or in consequence of place of birth . Lincoln delivered the closing address . The speech was purportedly so captivating that no reporter made a record of it . The address has become known as Lincoln 's Lost Speech . The delegates to the convention were : The Democrats had nominated Richardson for governor at their convention earlier that month . The remnants of the Whig party declined to run a candidate . The first Republican National Convention met that June , nominating John C. Fremont for president . Fremont was defeated handily in his bid for president , including in Illinois , but the Republican state ticket in Illinois was successful . Bissell became the first Governor from a party other than the Democrats since 1838 . Republicans would win every subsequent gubernatorial election through 1893

		GOLD_MENTION=Republican Presidential nomination
		CONTEXT=While the early scenes of Lincoln 's life are remarkably accurate , much of the later scenes contain historical inaccuracies . The famous Lincoln-Douglas debates , in addition to the historically accurate topic of the extension of slavery , have been turned into an argument about secession . Lincoln was famously an underdog for the Republican Presidential nomination in 1860 ; in the film it is suggested he is the sole nominee as a result of the Lincoln-Douglas debates . The outbreak of the Civil War seems to be the Union firing on Charleston , South Carolina from Fort Sumter , rather than the other way around . Also , early in hostilities , General Winfield Scott is depicted as being overconfident of a quick victory ( and something of a buffoon ) , when in reality he was one of the voices in the minority claiming the war would be long , costly , and bloody . Lincoln receives a report from the Secret Service that some copperheads in the North have issued threats against him . The Secret Service was not created until two months after Lincoln 's death . Finally , in the climax of the film , Lincoln delivers a conflation of famous words from the Gettysburg Address and Second Inaugural Address at Ford 's Theatre on April 14 , 1865 – just moments before being assassinated . This was Griffith 's second portrayal of Lincoln 's assassination , the first being in '' The Birth of a Nation ''

		CONTEXT=During the 1840s , Bowser painted banners for a diverse range of clients , including the Know Nothing Party , and received a commission to paint the portrait of prominent abolitionist and real estate developer Jacob C. White . Active in that decade 's efforts to repeal the clause in Pennsylvania 's Constitution which prohibited blacks from voting , Bowser and his family also became so involved with the abolition movement that their home became a stop on the Underground Railroad . In 1858 , politics and advocacy merged with art when Bower painted the portrait of abolitionist John Brown while Brown was visiting the Bowser home . During this same period , Bowser also completed work on his painting , '' The Firebell in the Night '' . In addition , he was also active , during this phase of his life , with the Grand United Order of Odd Fellows . As Grand Master of the Order in Philadelphia , he delivered the keynote address at the Annual Moveable Committee of the G.U.O. of O.F. in Toronto , Canada on October 17 , 1859 as its members celebrated the organization 's thirteenth anniversary . According to news reports , he was " listened to throughout with much attention , and was frequently rapturously applauded " as he " defined in eloquent terms the nature of the work of Odd Fellows — especially that great and leading principle , Charity , " and " remarked upon the practical good effected by Odd Fellowship , in alleviating distress and bestowing many of the comforts of life upon the aged and infirm of the Order , as well as conferring benefactions upon the widow and orphan . " Bowser 's work on the first banner was paid for through a commission awarded by the Contraband Relief Association ( CRA ) , an organization headed by Elizabeth Keckley , the formerly enslaved woman who became Mary Todd Lincoln 's dressmaker . It was then presented by the CRA to the leaders of 1st United States Colored Infantry . With respect to the other Bowser-designed battle flags , historians at the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission note that : " The 127th and 3rd regiments marched carrying banners reading ' We will prove ourselves men ' and ' Rather Die Freemen , Than Live To Be Slaves . ' Beneath these , black soldiers protect white women representing Columbia , the symbol of the republic . The 45th 's banner , proclaiming ' One Cause , One Country , ' shows a black soldier proudly holding an American flag in front of a bust of George Washington as black troops fight in the background . The 24th 's banner shows a black soldier ascending a hill , his arms outstretched in prayer , beneath the words ' Let Soldiers in War , Be Citizens in Peace . ' " For the 22nd USCT banner , Bowser depicted a black soldier pointing " a bayonet at the chest of a Confederate who has allowed his flag to fall and who is tossing aside his sword , " beneath the words , " Sic semper tyrannis " ( " thus always to tyrants " ) , a phrase which would come to have an entirely different meaning two years later when shouted by John Wilkes Booth after his assassination of Lincoln at Ford 's Theater

During the U.S. Presidential campaign of 1844 , he gave stump speeches for Henry Clay due to the Whig Party 's platform that opposed admitting Texas into the Union because it was a slave state . In the U.S. Presidential campaign of 1848 , Gibson supported Whig candidate , " Rough and Ready " General Zachary Taylor . However , he was concerned about the Whig Party 's lack of opposition to the abolition of slavery and personally visited Henry Clay at his home in Ashland , Kentucky in 1848 to discuss this issue . He lost as a Whig candidate for Ohio Attorney General in 1853 . In 1853 , following the large defeat of the Whig candidate General Winfield Scott in the U.S. Presidential election of 1852 , Gibson threw his support to the Free Soil Party and began organizing what would become the Republican Party in Ohio . He attended the first organization meeting of the Republican Party in spring of 1856 in Pittsburgh .

The 45th 's banner , proclaiming ' One Cause , One Country , ' shows a black soldier proudly holding an American flag in front of a bust of George Washington as black troops fight in the background . The 24th 's banner shows a black soldier ascending a hill , his arms outstretched in prayer , beneath the words ' Let Soldiers in War , Be Citizens in Peace . ' " For the 22nd USCT banner , Bowser depicted a black soldier pointing " a bayonet at the chest of a Confederate who has allowed his flag to fall and who is tossing aside his sword , " beneath the words , " Sic semper tyrannis " ( " thus always to tyrants " ) , a phrase which would come to have an entirely different meaning two years later when shouted by John Wilkes Booth after his assassination of Lincoln at Ford 's Theater

		CONTEXT=While the early scenes of Lincoln 's life are remarkably accurate , much of the later scenes contain historical inaccuracies . The famous Lincoln-Douglas debates , in addition to the historically accurate topic of the extension of slavery , have been turned into an argument about secession . Lincoln was famously an underdog for the Republican Presidential nomination in 1860 ; in the film it is suggested he is the sole nominee as a result of the Lincoln-Douglas debates . The outbreak of the Civil War seems to be the Union firing on Charleston , South Carolina from Fort Sumter , rather than the other way around . Also , early in hostilities , General Winfield Scott is depicted as being overconfident of a quick victory ( and something of a buffoon ) , when in reality he was one of the voices in the minority claiming the war would be long , costly , and bloody . Lincoln receives a report from the Secret Service that some copperheads in the North have issued threats against him . The Secret Service was not created until two months after Lincoln 's death . Finally , in the climax of the film , Lincoln delivers a conflation of famous words from the Gettysburg Address and Second Inaugural Address at Ford 's Theatre on April 14 , 1865 – just moments before being assassinated .

		CONTEXT=The first official Republican convention in Illinois was held on May 29 , 1856 , in Bloomington . Chairman John M. Palmer was elected convention president after his opening address . Nine vice presidents and five secretaries were then elected . The convention nominated Bissell for governor with Francis Hoffmann as lieutenant governor , Ozias M. Hatch for secretary of state , Jesse K. Dubois as auditor , and James Miller as treasurer . Hoffmann was found to be ineligible for his position due to a residency requirement , and John Wood was nominated in his place . The following resolutions defining the party platform were approved : Resolved , That foregoing all former differences of opinions upon other questions , we pledge ourselves to unite in opposition to the present administration and to the party which upholds and supports it and to use all honorable and constitutional means to wrest the Government from the unworthy hands which now control it and to bring it back in its administration to the principles and practices of Washington , Jefferson and their great and good compatriots of the Revolution . Resolved , That foregoing all former differences of opinions upon other questions , we pledge ourselves to unite in opposition to the present administration of the Government ; that under the Constitution Congress possesses the power to prohibit slavery in the Territories ; and that , whilst we will maintain all constitutional rights of the South , we also hold that justice , humanity , the principles of freedom as expressed in our Declaration of Independence and our national constitution , and the purity and perpetuity of our Government require that that power shall be exerted to prevent the extension of slavery into territory heretofore free . Resolved , That the repeal of the Missouri Compromise was unwise and injurious ; an open and aggravated violation of the plighted faith of the States , and that the attempt of the present administration to force slavery into Kansas against the known wishes of the legal voters of that Territory is an arbitrary and tyrannous violation of the rights of the people to govern themselves , and that we will strive by all constitutional means to secure to Kansas and Nebraska the legal guaranty against slavery of which they were deprived at the cost of the violation of the plighted faith of the nation . Resolved , That we are devoted to the Union and will , to the last extremity , defend it against the efforts now being made by the dis-unionists of this administration to compass its dissolution , and that we will support the Constitution of the United States , in all its provisions regarding it , as the sacred bond of our Union and the only safeguard for the preservation of the rights of ourselves and our posterity . Resolved , That we are in favor of the immediate admission of Kansas as a member of this Confederacy under the constitution adopted by the people of said Territory . Resolved , That the spirit of our institutions as well as the Constitution of our country , guarantees the liberty of conscience as well as political freedom , and that we will proscribe no one by legislation or otherwise on account of religious opinions , or in consequence of place of birth . Lincoln delivered the closing address . The speech was purportedly so captivating that no reporter made a record of it . The address has become known as Lincoln 's Lost Speech . The delegates to the convention were : The Democrats had nominated Richardson for governor at their convention earlier that month . The remnants of the Whig party declined to run a candidate . The first Republican National Convention met that June , nominating John C. Fremont for president . Fremont was defeated handily in his bid for president , including in Illinois , but the Republican state ticket in Illinois was successful . Bissell became the first Governor from a party other than the Democrats since 1838 . Republicans would win every subsequent gubernatorial election through 1893

		CONTEXT=During the 1840s , Bowser painted banners for a diverse range of clients , including the Know Nothing Party , and received a commission to paint the portrait of prominent abolitionist and real estate developer Jacob C. White . Active in that decade 's efforts to repeal the clause in Pennsylvania 's Constitution which prohibited blacks from voting , Bowser and his family also became so involved with the abolition movement that their home became a stop on the Underground Railroad . In 1858 , politics and advocacy merged with art when Bower painted the portrait of abolitionist John Brown while Brown was visiting the Bowser home . During this same period , Bowser also completed work on his painting , '' The Firebell in the Night '' . In addition , he was also active , during this phase of his life , with the Grand United Order of Odd Fellows . As Grand Master of the Order in Philadelphia , he delivered the keynote address at the Annual Moveable Committee of the G.U.O. of O.F. in Toronto , Canada on October 17 , 1859 as its members celebrated the organization 's thirteenth anniversary . According to news reports , he was " listened to throughout with much attention , and was frequently rapturously applauded " as he " defined in eloquent terms the nature of the work of Odd Fellows — especially that great and leading principle , Charity , " and " remarked upon the practical good effected by Odd Fellowship , in alleviating distress and bestowing many of the comforts of life upon the aged and infirm of the Order , as well as conferring benefactions upon the widow and orphan . " Bowser 's work on the first banner was paid for through a commission awarded by the Contraband Relief Association ( CRA ) , an organization headed by Elizabeth Keckley , the formerly enslaved woman who became Mary Todd Lincoln 's dressmaker . It was then presented by the CRA to the leaders of 1st United States Colored Infantry . With respect to the other Bowser-designed battle flags , historians at the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission note that : " The 127th and 3rd regiments marched carrying banners reading ' We will prove ourselves men ' and ' Rather Die Freemen , Than Live To Be Slaves .

		CONTEXT=Prior to and during the Civil War , Pennsylvania was a divided state . Although Pennsylvania had outlawed slavery , many conservative Pennsylvanians believed that the federal government should not interfere with the institution of slavery . One such individual was Democrat James Buchanan , the last pre-Civil War president . Buchanan 's party had generally won presidential and gubernatorial elections in Pennsylvania . However , the nascent Republican Party 's first convention took place in Philadelphia , and the 1860 elections saw the Republican Party win the state 's presidential vote and the governor 's office . After the failure of the Crittenden Compromise , the secession of the South , and the Battle of Fort Sumter , the Civil War began with Pennsylvania as a key member of the Union . Despite the Republican victory the 1860 election , Democrats remained powerful in the state , and several " copperheads " called for peace during the war . The Democrats re-took control of the state legislature in the 1862 election , but incumbent Republican Governor Andrew Curtin retained control of the governorship in 1863 . In the 1864 election , President Lincoln narrowly defeated Pennsylvania native George B. McClellan for the state 's electoral votes

		CONTEXT=The first official Republican convention in Illinois was held on May 29 , 1856 , in Bloomington . Chairman John M. Palmer was elected convention president after his opening address . Nine vice presidents and five secretaries were then elected . The convention nominated Bissell for governor with Francis Hoffmann as lieutenant governor , Ozias M. Hatch for secretary of state , Jesse K. Dubois as auditor , and James Miller as treasurer . Hoffmann was found to be ineligible for his position due to a residency requirement , and John Wood was nominated in his place . The following resolutions defining the party platform were approved : Resolved , That foregoing all former differences of opinions upon other questions , we pledge ourselves to unite in opposition to the present administration and to the party which upholds and supports it and to use all honorable and constitutional means to wrest the Government from the unworthy hands which now control it and to bring it back in its administration to the principles and practices of Washington , Jefferson and their great and good compatriots of the Revolution . Resolved , That foregoing all former differences of opinions upon other questions , we pledge ourselves to unite in opposition to the present administration of the Government ; that under the Constitution Congress possesses the power to prohibit slavery in the Territories ; and that , whilst we will maintain all constitutional rights of the South , we also hold that justice , humanity , the principles of freedom as expressed in our Declaration of Independence and our national constitution , and the purity and perpetuity of our Government require that that power shall be exerted to prevent the extension of slavery into territory heretofore free . Resolved , That the repeal of the Missouri Compromise was unwise and injurious ; an open and aggravated violation of the plighted faith of the States , and that the attempt of the present administration to force slavery into Kansas against the known wishes of the legal voters of that Territory is an arbitrary and tyrannous violation of the rights of the people to govern themselves , and that we will strive by all constitutional means to secure to Kansas and Nebraska the legal guaranty against slavery of which they were deprived at the cost of the violation of the plighted faith of the nation . Resolved , That we are devoted to the Union and will , to the last extremity , defend it against the efforts now being made by the dis-unionists of this administration to compass its dissolution , and that we will support the Constitution of the United States , in all its provisions regarding it , as the sacred bond of our Union and the only safeguard for the preservation of the rights of ourselves and our posterity . Resolved , That we are in favor of the immediate admission of Kansas as a member of this Confederacy under the constitution adopted by the people of said Territory . Resolved , That the spirit of our institutions as well as the Constitution of our country , guarantees the liberty of conscience as well as political freedom , and that we will proscribe no one by legislation or otherwise on account of religious opinions , or in consequence of place of birth . Lincoln delivered the closing address . The speech was purportedly so captivating that no reporter made a record of it . The address has become known as Lincoln 's Lost Speech . The delegates to the convention were : The Democrats had nominated Richardson for governor at their convention earlier that month . The remnants of the Whig party declined to run a candidate . The first Republican National Convention met that June , nominating John C. Fremont for president . Fremont was defeated handily in his bid for president , including in Illinois , but the Republican state ticket in Illinois was successful . Bissell became the first Governor from a party other than the Democrats since 1838 . Republicans would win every subsequent gubernatorial election through 1893

		CONTEXT=In the aftermath of the battle over the national bank , Jackson 's political opponents coalesced into the Whig Party . By taking a name rooted in American and British history , the Whigs implicitly criticized Jackson as a tyrannical executive . Although National Republicans like Clay and Webster formed the core of the Whig Party , Anti-Masonic leaders like William H. Seward and states ' rights Democrats like John Tyler also joined the new party . The Whig Party proved more durable than the National Republican Party and , along with the Democrats , the Whigs became one of the two major parties of the Second Party System , which would extend into the 1850s . By 1834 , Webster supporters such as Caleb Cushing , Rufus Choate , Abbott Lawrence , and Edward Everett had begun preparing for his candidacy in the 1836 presidential election . With Clay showing no indication of making another run , Webster hoped to become the main Whig candidate in the 1836 election , but General William Henry Harrison and Senator Hugh Lawson White retained strong support in the West and the South , respectively . Rather than uniting behind one presidential candidate , Whig leaders settled on a strategy of running multiple candidates in order to force a contingent election in the House of Representatives . Webster was nominated for president by the Massachusetts legislature , but Harrison won the backing of most Whigs outside of the South . Although Webster had a far greater reputation as a national figure than Harrison , many Whigs hoped that Harrison 's military record would allow him to replicate Jackson 's 1832 victory . Webster 's chances also suffered from his lingering association with the Federalist Party , his close relationship with elite politicians and businessmen , and his lack of appeal among the broad populace ; Remini writes that the American public " admired and revered him but did not love or trust him . " With little support outside of his home state , Webster attempted to withdraw his presidential candidacy , but , to his eventual regret , Massachusetts Whig leaders convinced him to stay in the race . Meanwhile , the 1835 Democratic National Convention nominated Van Buren , Jackson 's preferred successor , for president . In the 1836 election , Van Buren won a majority of the popular and electoral vote , Harrison finished a distant second , and White carried two Southern states . Webster won only the electoral votes of Massachusetts . Adding to his displeasure , Webster lost a major Supreme Court decision , '' Charles River Bridge v. Warren Bridge '' , shortly after the election

		CONTEXT=The Moldavian Revolution of 1848 is the name used for the unsuccessful Romanian liberal and Romantic nationalist movement inspired by the Revolutions of 1848 in the principality of Moldavia . Initially seeking accommodation within the political framework defined by the Regulamentul Organic , it eventually rejected it as imposed by foreign powers ( the Russian Empire ) and called for more thorough political reforms . Led by a group of young intellectuals , the movement was mostly limited to petitioning and constitutional projects , unlike the successful uprising taking place later that year in neighbouring Wallachia , and it was quickly suppressed . This was despite the fact that the Moldavian revolutionaries were more moderate and willing to compromise in their demands for reforms than their Wallachian counterparts , as Moldavian political and social life continued to be dominated by a landed , conservative aristocracy , with the middle class still embryonic .

		CONTEXT=With the defeat of Adams , Clay became the de facto leader of the National Republicans , and he began making preparations for a presidential campaign in the 1832 election . In 1831 , Jackson made it clear that he was going to run for re-election , ensuring that support or opposition to his presidency would be a central feature of the upcoming race . Jackson 's Democrats rallied around his policies towards the national bank , internal improvements , Indian removal , and nullification , but these policies also earned Jackson various enemies , including Vice President John C. Calhoun . However , Clay rejected overtures from the fledgling Anti-Masonic Party , and his attempt to convince Calhoun to serve as his running mate failed , leaving the opposition to Jackson split among different factions . Inspired by the Anti-Masonic Party 's national convention , Clay 's National Republican followers arranged for a national convention that nominated Clay for president

Although Pennsylvania had outlawed slavery , many conservative Pennsylvanians believed that the federal government should not interfere with the institution of slavery . One such individual was Democrat James Buchanan , the last pre-Civil War president . Buchanan 's party had generally won presidential and gubernatorial elections in Pennsylvania . However , the nascent Republican Party 's first convention took place in Philadelphia , and the 1860 elections saw the Republican Party win the state 's presidential vote and the governor 's office . After the failure of the Crittenden Compromise , the secession of the South , and the Battle of Fort Sumter , the Civil War began with Pennsylvania as a key member of the Union . Despite the Republican victory the 1860 election , Democrats remained powerful in the state , and several " copperheads " called for peace during the war . The Democrats re-took control of the state legislature in the 1862 election , but incumbent Republican Governor Andrew Curtin retained control of the governorship in 1863 . In the 1864 election , President Lincoln narrowly defeated Pennsylvania native George B. McClellan for the state 's electoral votes

Du Bois , Ida B. Wells and Mary Church Terrell to establish the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People . Walling and Ovington both argued inside the party that it had not done enough to oppose racism and they were joined by other left-wing intellectuals who published articles in the party press about the importance of anti-racism to the socialist cause , including Hubert Harrison and I.

		GOLD_MENTION=1835 Democratic National Convention
		CONTEXT=In the aftermath of the battle over the national bank , Jackson 's political opponents coalesced into the Whig Party . By taking a name rooted in American and British history , the Whigs implicitly criticized Jackson as a tyrannical executive . Although National Republicans like Clay and Webster formed the core of the Whig Party , Anti-Masonic leaders like William H. Seward and states ' rights Democrats like John Tyler also joined the new party . The Whig Party proved more durable than the National Republican Party and , along with the Democrats , the Whigs became one of the two major parties of the Second Party System , which would extend into the 1850s . By 1834 , Webster supporters such as Caleb Cushing , Rufus Choate , Abbott Lawrence , and Edward Everett had begun preparing for his candidacy in the 1836 presidential election . With Clay showing no indication of making another run , Webster hoped to become the main Whig candidate in the 1836 election , but General William Henry Harrison and Senator Hugh Lawson White retained strong support in the West and the South , respectively . Rather than uniting behind one presidential candidate , Whig leaders settled on a strategy of running multiple candidates in order to force a contingent election in the House of Representatives . Webster was nominated for president by the Massachusetts legislature , but Harrison won the backing of most Whigs outside of the South . Although Webster had a far greater reputation as a national figure than Harrison , many Whigs hoped that Harrison 's military record would allow him to replicate Jackson 's 1832 victory . Webster 's chances also suffered from his lingering association with the Federalist Party , his close relationship with elite politicians and businessmen , and his lack of appeal among the broad populace ; Remini writes that the American public " admired and revered him but did not love or trust him . " With little support outside of his home state , Webster attempted to withdraw his presidential candidacy , but , to his eventual regret , Massachusetts Whig leaders convinced him to stay in the race . Meanwhile , the 1835 Democratic National Convention nominated Van Buren , Jackson 's preferred successor , for president . In the 1836 election , Van Buren won a majority of the popular and electoral vote , Harrison finished a distant second , and White carried two Southern states . Webster won only the electoral votes of Massachusetts . Adding to his displeasure , Webster lost a major Supreme Court decision , '' Charles River Bridge v. Warren Bridge '' , shortly after the election

		CONTEXT=While the early scenes of Lincoln 's life are remarkably accurate , much of the later scenes contain historical inaccuracies . The famous Lincoln-Douglas debates , in addition to the historically accurate topic of the extension of slavery , have been turned into an argument about secession . Lincoln was famously an underdog for the Republican Presidential nomination in 1860 ; in the film it is suggested he is the sole nominee as a result of the Lincoln-Douglas debates . The outbreak of the Civil War seems to be the Union firing on Charleston , South Carolina from Fort Sumter , rather than the other way around . Also , early in hostilities , General Winfield Scott is depicted as being overconfident of a quick victory ( and something of a buffoon ) , when in reality he was one of the voices in the minority claiming the war would be long , costly , and bloody . Lincoln receives a report from the Secret Service that some copperheads in the North have issued threats against him . The Secret Service was not created until two months after Lincoln 's death . Finally , in the climax of the film , Lincoln delivers a conflation of famous words from the Gettysburg Address and Second Inaugural Address at Ford 's Theatre on April 14 , 1865 – just moments before being assassinated . This was Griffith 's second portrayal of Lincoln 's assassination , the first being in '' The Birth of a Nation ''

		CONTEXT=RS Ophiuchi ( RS Oph ) is a recurrent nova system approximately 5,000 light - years away in the constellation Ophiuchus . In its quiet phase it has an apparent magnitude of about 12.5 . It has been observed to erupt in 1898 , 1933 , 1958 , 1967 , 1985 , and 2006 and reached about magnitude 5 on average . A further two eruptions , in 1907 and 1945 , have been inferred from archival data . The recurrent nova is produced by a white dwarf star and a red giant in a binary system . About every 20 years , enough material from the red giant builds up on the surface of the white dwarf to produce a thermonuclear explosion . The white dwarf orbits close to the red giant , with an accretion disc concentrating the overflowing atmosphere of the red giant onto the white dwarf .

		CONTEXT=HD 140283 ( or the Methuselah star ) [ 10 ] is a metal - poor subgiant star about 200 light years away from the Earth in the constellation Libra , near the boundary with Ophiuchus in the Milky Way Galaxy . Its apparent magnitude is 7.205 . It is the oldest star known as of 2021 . The star 's light is somewhat blueshifted as it is moving toward rather than away from the Earth and it has been known to astronomers for over a century as a high - velocity star based on its other vectors ( proper motion ) . An early spectroscopic analysis by Joseph W. Chamberlain and Lawrence Aller revealed it to have a substantially lower metal content than the Sun . [ 11 ] Modern spectroscopic analyses find an iron content about a factor of 250 lower than that of the Sun . It is one of the closest metal - poor ( Population II ) stars to Earth .

		CONTEXT=RR Caeli is a double star in the constellation Caelum . It is approximately 66 light years from Earth . It was first noted to be a high - proper motion star in 1955 by Jacob Luyten , and given the name LFT 349 . Discovered to be an eclipsing binary in 1979 , it has a baseline magnitude of 14.36 , dimming markedly every 7.2 hours for an interval of around 10 minutes , due to the total eclipse of the brighter star by the fainter one . Its variability in brightness led to its being given the variable star designation RR Caeli in 1984 . This star system consists of a red dwarf of spectral type M6 and a white dwarf that orbit each other every seven hours ; the former is 18 % as massive as the Sun , while the latter has 44 % of the Sun 's mass . The red dwarf is tidally locked with the white dwarf , meaning it displays the same side to the heavier star . The system is also a post-common-envelope binary , and the red dwarf star is transferring material onto the white dwarf . In approximately 9 – 20 billion years , RR Caeli will likely become a cataclysmic variable star due to the period 's gradual shortening , leading to increasing rates of transfer of hydrogen to the surface of the white dwarf . The white dwarf is likely to have a plain helium core , as its density is too low for the carbon - oxygen core .

		CONTEXT=Symbiotic novae are slow irregular eruptive variable stars with very slow nova - like outbursts with an amplitude of between 9 and 11 magnitudes . The symbiotic nova remains at maximum for one or a few decades , and then declines towards its original luminosity . Variables of this type are double star systems with one red giant , which probably is a Mira variable , and one white dwarf , with markedly contrasting spectra and whose proximity and mass characteristics indicate it as a symbiotic star . The red giant fills its Roche lobe so that matter is transferred to the white dwarf and accumulates until a nova - like outburst occurs , caused by ignition of thermonuclear fusion . The temperature at maximum is estimated to rise up to 200,000 K , similar to the energy source of novae , but dissimilar to the dwarf novae . The slow luminosity increase would then be simply due to time needed for growth of the ionization front in the outburst .

		CONTEXT=In the field of astronomy the term chord typically refers to a line crossing an object which is formed during an occultation event . By taking accurate measurements of the start and end times of the event , in conjunction with the known location of the observer and the object 's orbit , the length of the chord can be determined giving an indication of the size of the occulting object . By combining observations made from several different locations , multiple chords crossing the occulting object can be determined giving a more accurate shape and size model . This technique of using multiple observers during the same event has been used to derive more sophisticated shape models for asteroids , whose shape can be highly irregular . A notable example of this occurred in 2002 when the asteroid 345 Tercidina underwent a stellar occultation of a very bright star as seen from Europe . During this event a team of at least 105 observers recorded 75 chords across the asteroid 's surface allowing for a very accurate size and shape determination .

		CONTEXT=He arrived at the club as an incredibly shy and underdeveloped personality , a fact that was noted by teammate Trent Cotchin who said though Martin was 18 “ he seemed much younger in some of the ways he behaved . ” Indeed , he struggled initially to adjust to the expectations of professional football . In one incident in the 2010 preseason he was removed from training and verbally reprimanded by club leadership when he was deemed unfit to train after a big night out . Despite these struggles , his on-field development was such that he would still debut in the 2010 season 's opening match , a 56-point Richmond loss against at the MCG . Martin recorded the sixth most disposals of any Tiger ( 18 ) to go along with four marks , three tackles and three clearances . Two weeks later Martin was convicted by the AFL tribunal for a high hit on Sydney 's Josh Kennedy in round 3 . He did not receive a suspension for the incident however , returning to football the following week . After four matches Martin ranked fourth in the league for clearances and eighth for hard-ball gets . Media reports emerged after round 8 that the 18 year old Martin had received a significant contract offer from expansion club the Greater Western Sydney Giants . The offer , which the Herald Sun ’s Mark Robinson claimed to be worth $ 2.4 million over three seasons , would have taken effect in the new club 's first AFL season in 2012 . Martin later said he had never entertained the idea of moving to the start-up club . In round 10 he had gained attention for his on-field efforts again , this time being nominated for the 2010 AFL Rising Star award after a 21 disposal and 11 clearance match against Port Adelaide . Due to his previous tribunal conviction however , Martin was ruled ineligible for the award and thus did not officially place in the end of season award 's points tally . He drew the attention of Sydney coach Paul Roos by round 14 , prompting Roos to send veteran Brett Kirk onto Martin in a tagging role . Despite this extra attention , he still managed to record 18 disposals and a goal in the match at the MCG . After 17 rounds Martin ranked second at the club for clearances and inside 50s as well as third for disposals and contested possessions . At the same time he ranked first among that season 's Rising Star nominees in clearances , contested possessions and inside 50s . He was also fourth for average disposals and fifth for average tackles . In round 19 he was rested by the club before returning to play out the final five matches of the season . He missed just that one game in his debut season and finished the year ranked second at Richmond for clearances and inside 50s , as well as third for both contested possessions and disposals . In addition to winning the Fred Swift Medal for fourth place at the club 's best and fairest night , Martin also received six votes in the Brownlow Medal count that year , the most by any Richmond debutant since Craig Lambert in 1988 . At season 's end he reiterated his commitment to the club ( and rejection of the former GWS overtures ) by signing a two-year contract extension that would keep him at Richmond until the end of the 2013 season . The extension was reported by the Herald Sun to be in the vicinity of $ 400,000-a-year

		CONTEXT=He arrived at the club as an incredibly shy and underdeveloped personality , a fact that was noted by teammate Trent Cotchin who said though Martin was 18 “ he seemed much younger in some of the ways he behaved . ” Indeed , he struggled initially to adjust to the expectations of professional football . In one incident in the 2010 preseason he was removed from training and verbally reprimanded by club leadership when he was deemed unfit to train after a big night out . Despite these struggles , his on-field development was such that he would still debut in the 2010 season 's opening match , a 56-point Richmond loss against at the MCG . Martin recorded the sixth most disposals of any Tiger ( 18 ) to go along with four marks , three tackles and three clearances . Two weeks later Martin was convicted by the AFL tribunal for a high hit on Sydney 's Josh Kennedy in round 3 . He did not receive a suspension for the incident however , returning to football the following week . After four matches Martin ranked fourth in the league for clearances and eighth for hard-ball gets . Media reports emerged after round 8 that the 18 year old Martin had received a significant contract offer from expansion club the Greater Western Sydney Giants . The offer , which the Herald Sun ’s Mark Robinson claimed to be worth $ 2.4 million over three seasons , would have taken effect in the new club 's first AFL season in 2012 . Martin later said he had never entertained the idea of moving to the start-up club . In round 10 he had gained attention for his on-field efforts again , this time being nominated for the 2010 AFL Rising Star award after a 21 disposal and 11 clearance match against Port Adelaide . Due to his previous tribunal conviction however , Martin was ruled ineligible for the award and thus did not officially place in the end of season award 's points tally . He drew the attention of Sydney coach Paul Roos by round 14 , prompting Roos to send veteran Brett Kirk onto Martin in a tagging role . Despite this extra attention , he still managed to record 18 disposals and a goal in the match at the MCG . After 17 rounds Martin ranked second at the club for clearances and inside 50s as well as third for disposals and contested possessions . At the same time he ranked first among that season 's Rising Star nominees in clearances , contested possessions and inside 50s . He was also fourth for average disposals and fifth for average tackles . In round 19 he was rested by the club before returning to play out the final five matches of the season . He missed just that one game in his debut season and finished the year ranked second at Richmond for clearances and inside 50s , as well as third for both contested possessions and disposals . In addition to winning the Fred Swift Medal for fourth place at the club 's best and fairest night , Martin also received six votes in the Brownlow Medal count that year , the most by any Richmond debutant since Craig Lambert in 1988 . At season 's end he reiterated his commitment to the club ( and rejection of the former GWS overtures ) by signing a two-year contract extension that would keep him at Richmond until the end of the 2013 season . The extension was reported by the Herald Sun to be in the vicinity of $ 400,000-a-year

		CONTEXT=Saint Joan of the Stockyards ( ) is a play written by the German modernist playwright Bertolt Brecht between 1929 and 1931 , after the success of his musical The Threepenny Opera and during the period of his radical experimental work with the Lehrstücke . It is based on the musical that he co-authored with Elisabeth Hauptmann , Happy End ( 1929 ) . In this version of the story of Joan of Arc , Brecht transforms her into " Joan Dark " , a member of the " Black Straw Hats " ( a Salvation Army - like group ) in 20th - century Chicago . The play charts Joan 's battle with Pierpont Mauler , the unctuous owner of a meat - packing plant . Like her predecessor , Joan is a doomed woman , a martyr and ( initially , at least ) an innocent in a world of strike - breakers , fat cats , and penniless workers . Like many of Brecht 's plays it is laced with humor and songs as part of its epic dramaturgical structure and deals with the theme of emancipation from material suffering and exploitation .

		GOLD_MENTION=surge in political purges
		CONTEXT=There were numerous exiled German communists in Moscow , and they all used to report on one another to the Soviet authorities during the surge in political purges that accompanied growing political tensions domestically and internationally at this time . Such information demonstrated loyalty and was often blended with impressions or combined with denunciations . Hotropp himself provided a written report on Herwarth Walden , a fellow teacher at the Foreign Languages Institute who was later arrested . There was a perception that reports of this nature did not in themselves cause the authorities to arrest suspects , but they were certainly used by the NKVD where they provided evidential support for arrests that took place . Albert Hotopp 's own turn came on 31 May 1941 when he was arrested . On 1 August 1942 he was condemned to death . Available records are silent as to what happened next , but it is likely that he died shortly afterwards , probably in a Soviet labour camp . His wife Gertrud and their daughters were sent to continue their lives in Kazakhstan . His widow finally made her way back to East Germany in 1955 , after which she survived another thirty years . Albert Hotopp was formally rehabilitated by the Soviets in 1960

		GOLD_MENTION=S7 Airlines Flight 778
		CONTEXT=Rasputin 's daughter Maria died in the 2006 crash of S7 Airlines Flight 778 , and his wife died six years later . He died in Moscow on 14 March 2015 , a day short of his 78th birthday . Patriarch Kirill of the Russian Orthodox Church conducted his funeral service , and President Vladimir Putin paid his respects . ( In 2014 Rasputin had co-signed a letter by writers in support of Putin 's annexation of the Crimea . ) Rasputin is closely associated with a movement in post-war Soviet literature known as " village prose , " or sometimes " rural prose " ( деревенская проза ) . Beginning in the time of the Khrushchev Thaw ( оттепель ) , village prose was praised for its stylistic and thematic departures from socialist realism . Village prose works usually focused on the hardships of the Soviet peasantry , espoused an idealized picture of traditional village life , and implicitly or explicitly criticized official modernization projects . Rasputin 's 1979 novel '' Farewell to Matyora '' , which depicts a fictional Siberian village which is to be evacuated and cleared so that a hydroelectric dam can be constructed further down the Angara River , was considered the epitome of this genre . The opening paragraph below is a good example of Rasputin 's writing style ( exceptional even for the village prose writers ) , and the novel 's theme of natural cycles disrupted by modernization : '' Once more spring had come , one more in the never-ending cycle , but for Matyora this spring would be the last , the last for both the island and the village that bore the same name . Once more , rumbling passionately , the ice broke , piling up mounds on the banks , and the liberated Angara River opened up , stretching out into a mighty , sparkling flow . Once more the water gushed boisterously at the island ’s upper tip , before cascading down both channels of the riverbed ; once more greenery flared on the ground and in the greens , the first rains soaked the earth , the swifts and swallows flew back , and at dusk in the bogs the awakened frogs croaked their love of life . It had all happened many times before . '' ( From Rasputin 's novel '' Farewell to Matyora '' , translated by Antonina W. Bouis , 1979 ) Rasputin 's nonfiction works contain similar themes , often in support of relevant political causes . He directed particularly trenchant criticism at large-scale dam building , like the project that flooded his own hometown , and water management projects , like the diversion of the Siberian rivers to Central Asia . He argued that these projects were destructive not simply in an ecological sense , but in a moral sense as well

		GOLD_MENTION=2009 Heilongjiang mine explosion
		CONTEXT=Safety has long been a concern in the mining business , especially in sub-surface mining . The Courrières mine disaster , Europe 's worst mining accident , involved the death of 1,099 miners in Northern France on March 10 , 1906 . This disaster was surpassed only by the Benxihu Colliery accident in China on April 26 , 1942 , which killed 1,549 miners . While mining today is substantially safer than it was in previous decades , mining accidents still occur . Government figures indicate that 5,000 Chinese miners die in accidents each year , while other reports have suggested a figure as high as 20,000 . Mining accidents continue worldwide , including accidents causing dozens of fatalities at a time such as the 2007 Ulyanovskaya Mine disaster in Russia , the 2009 Heilongjiang mine explosion in China , and the 2010 Upper Big Branch Mine disaster in the United States . Mining has been identified by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ( NIOSH ) as a priority industry sector in the National Occupational Research Agenda ( NORA ) to identify and provide intervention strategies regarding occupational health and safety issues . The Mining Safety and Health Administration ( MSHA ) was established in 1978 to " work to prevent death , illness , and injury from mining and promote safe and healthful workplaces for US miners . " Since its implementation in 1978 , the number of miner fatalities has decreased from 242 miners in 1978 to 28 miners in 2015

		CONTEXT=The Big Bounce is a hypothesized cosmological model for the origin of the known universe . It was originally suggested as a phase of the cyclic model or oscillatory universe interpretation of the Big Bang , where the first cosmological event was the result of the collapse of a previous universe . It receded from serious consideration in the early 1980s after inflation theory emerged as a solution to the horizon problem , which had arisen from advances in observations revealing the large - scale structure of the universe . In the early 2000s , inflation was found by some theorists to be problematic and unfalsifiable in that its various parameters could be adjusted to fit any observations , so that the properties of the observable universe are a matter of chance . Alternative pictures including a Big Bounce may provide a predictive and falsifiable possible solution to the horizon problem , and are under active investigation as of 2017 .

		CONTEXT=The concept of " curvature of space " is fundamental to cosmology . A space without curvature is called a " flat space " or Euclidean space . Whether the universe is “ flat ″ could determine its ultimate fate ; whether it will expand forever , or ultimately collapse back into itself . The geometry of spacetime has been measured by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe ( WMAP ) to be nearly flat . According to the WMAP 5 - year results and analysis , “ WMAP determined that the universe is flat , from which it follows that the mean energy density in the universe is equal to the critical density ( within a 1 % margin of error ) . This is equivalent to a mass density of 9.9 × 10 − 30 g / cm 3 , which is equivalent to only 5.9 protons per cubic meter . ” The WMAP data are consistent with a flat geometry , with Ω = 1.02 + / - 0.02 .

		CONTEXT=The LHCb ( Large Hadron Collider beauty ) experiment is one of eight particle physics detector experiments collecting data at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN . LHCb is a specialized b - physics experiment , designed primarily to measure the parameters of CP violation in the interactions of b - hadrons ( heavy particles containing a bottom quark ) . Such studies can help to explain the matter - antimatter asymmetry of the Universe . The detector is also able to perform measurements of production cross sections , exotic hadron spectroscopy , charm physics and electroweak physics in the forward region . The LHCb collaboration , who built , operate and analyse data from the experiment , is composed of approximately 1260 people from 74 scientific institutes , representing 16 countries . Chris Parkes succeeded on July 1 , 2020 as spokesperson for the collaboration to Giovanni Passaleva ( spokesperson 2017 - 2020 ) . The experiment is located at point 8 on the LHC tunnel close to Ferney - Voltaire , France just over the border from Geneva . The ( small ) MoEDAL experiment shares the same cavern .

		CONTEXT=Neutrinos are subatomic particles that have extremely small mass . These particles most closely resemble electrons but have no charge , and nearly zero interaction with any sort of matter , making the detection of neutrinos very difficult for astronomers . Neutrinos , given the nickname ghost particles , may just seem like " nothing " as described by University of California at Davis Physics Professor John Conway , but are essential in understanding the physics of our universe . Types of neutrinos include atmospheric , supernova , the diffuse supernova neutrino background , and solar neutrinos . Solar neutrinos are specifically neutrinos that originate from the sun , and are the most common type of neutrino passing through a person or any other source observed on Earth at any particular moment . These neutrinos are born from a process known as Nuclear fusion that occurs in our sun 's core .

		CONTEXT=Nemesis is a hypothetical red dwarf or brown dwarf , originally postulated in 1984 to be orbiting the Sun at a distance of about 95,000 AU ( 1.5 light - years ) , somewhat beyond the Oort cloud , to explain a perceived cycle of mass extinctions in the geological record , which seem to occur more often at intervals of 26 million years . , more than 1800 brown dwarfs have been identified . There are actually fewer brown dwarfs in our cosmic neighborhood than previously thought . Rather than one star for every brown dwarf , there may be as many as six stars for every brown dwarf . The majority of solar - type stars are single . The previous idea stated half or perhaps most stellar systems were binary , trinary , or multiple - star systems associated with clusters of stars , rather than the single - star systems that tend to be seen most often . In a 2017 paper , Sarah Sadavoy and Steven Stahler argued that the Sun was likely part of a binary system at the time of its formation , leading them to suggest " there probably was a Nemesis , a long time ago " . Such a star would have separated from this binary system over four billion years ago , meaning it could not be responsible for the more recent perceived cycle of mass extinctions , Douglas Vakoch told Business Insider , adding that " If the sun really was part of a binary star system in its early days , its early twin deserves a benign name like Companion , rather than the threatening Nemesis .

		CONTEXT=Around the early 16th century , following the construction of the Ribeira Palace beside the Tagus river , the Palace of Alcáçova began to lose its importance . An earthquake occurring in 1531 further damaged the old castle , contributing further to its decay and neglect . In 1569 , King Sebastian ordered the rebuilding of the royal apartments in the castle , intending to use it as his official residence . As part of the rebuilding , in 1577 Filippo Terzi demolished one of the towers near the principal facade of the Church of Loreto . However , many of the works were never completed after the young king 's apparent death during the Battle of Alcácer Quibir . The following Portuguese dynastic crisis opened the way for sixty years of Spanish rule and the castle was converted into military barracks and a prison . On 30 December 1642 , Teodósio de Frias the Younger was appointed master builder to continue the works begun by his father , Luís de Frias , and his grandfather , Teodósio de Frias . This was part of a greater plan by the Spanish forces to recommission the fortification . However , after Portugal regained its independence following the Portuguese Restoration War , the works were taken over by the Portuguese government . On 6 November 1648 , Nicolau de Langres was called upon to take over the design , execution and construction of a new fortification that would surround the Castle of São Jorge and the city walls of Lisbon . In 1650 the military architect Mateus do Couto was named master builder of the project and reconstruction took on a new formality : although the military engineer João Gillot built new walls in 1652 , construction again followed Couto 's plans between 1657 and 1733 . In 1673 , the Soldiers ' Hospital , dedicated to '' São João de Deus '' ( St John of God ) , was installed on the grounds beside the Rua do Recolhimento . At the end of the 17th century the '' Recolhimento do Castelo '' ( " Castle Shelter " ) was constructed along the southeast angle of the courtyard , and in 1733 , new projects were initiated by master Custódio Vieira

Based near Hong Kong , Boggs constantly raided outgoing clipper ships carrying highly valuable cargo of opium throughout the decade . He is most particularly known for his cruelty , as in one recorded incident he had the body of a captured Chinese merchant cut into small pieces and had them delivered to shore in small buckets as a warning against interference in his criminal activities . In 1857 , after a violent and bloody siege , Boggs was forced to swim ashore after his junk was destroyed by rival pirates . However , after holding his captors at bay with a knife , Boggs was finally apprehended and imprisoned in a Hong Kong jail for three years , eventually being tried for murder before his deportation to the United States in 1857 . The closing statement he made at his trial resounded with George Wingrove Cooke and triggered an investigation into one of Hong Kong 's earliest political scandals : the collaboration between government 's Daniel Caldwell and pirate Ma Chow Wong .

		CONTEXT=Later recollections occur as Polja is practically dead and Žana is urging Marija to rest as much as possible . These involve an early run-in with antisemitism : fourteen-year-old Marija , who grew up in the Vojvodina , was sent to the country to escape the persecution of Jews only to hear from a girl her age that she and her ancestors are guilty of killing Christ . She hastens home to her parents ; her drunk father explains to her what is happening to the area 's Jewish population , a truth she is not prepared to hear but then accepts .

		GOLD_MENTION=Korićani Cliffs massacre
		CONTEXT=Trnopolje was described variously as a ghetto , a prison and a detention camp . A United Nations ( UN ) report from 1994 reported that Trnopolje was a concentration camp which functioned as a staging area for mass deportations mainly of women , children , and elderly men . The reported found that : Refugees reported that Trnopolje was a " decent " camp in comparison to Omarska and Keraterm as there were no systematic killings , only arbitrary ones . Indeed , many non-Serbs entered the camp voluntarily , " simply to avoid the rampaging militias plundering their streets and villages " . This phenomenon led British journalist Ed Vulliamy to describe Trnopolje as " a perverse haven " for the Bosniaks and Croats of Prijedor . Author Hariz Halilovich writes : Many inmates were starved and physically or verbally abused during their imprisonment . By August 1992 , Trnopolje held about 3,500 people . On 7 August 1992 , reporters from Independent Television News ( ITN ) , a British television station , took footage of the prisoners at Omarska and Trnopolje , and recorded their living conditions . The images were shown around the world and caused public outrage . This prompted the Bosnian Serb authorities to allow journalists and the International Red Cross ( IRC ) access to some of the Prijedor camps , but not before the most emaciated of the prisoners were killed or shipped off to camps far from the public eye . Some 200 former male inmates were separated and killed in the Korićani Cliffs massacre on 21 August 1992 . The publicity generated by the discovery of the Prijedor camps led to their closure by the end of August . In mid-August , Trnopolje was placed into the hands of the IRC . The camp was officially shut down that November

		CONTEXT=The ceremony was held on a night other than Sunday for the first time since 1976 ( the 28th Primetime Emmy Awards were also staged on a Monday that year , May 17 ) . The ceremony 's unusual date — a Monday night in late August — was due to two factors , primary being NBC 's commitment to '' Sunday Night Football '' ; since acquiring the National Football League 's Sunday night game package in 2006 , NBC , when it is their turn in the four-network rotation to air the Primetime Emmy Awards , usually schedules the ceremony for the Sunday before Labor Day weekend , to avoid conflicts with '' SNF '' in mid-September ( when ABC , CBS , or Fox normally air the ceremony ) . NBC 's ideal date on the 2014 calendar for the ceremony ( Sunday , August 24 ) led to the other scheduling factor — MTV 's Video Music Awards , which were set for that night more than a year in advance ( and would be staged in the L.A. area as well , at The Forum in Inglewood ) . On January 28 , 2014 , rather than go head-to-head with the VMA 's , NBC announced that the ceremony would take place on Monday , August 25 . The move would allow NBC to commit to a preseason '' Sunday Night Football '' broadcast for the 24th ( a game between the Cincinnati Bengals and Arizona Cardinals ) ; it also ensured the tradition of staging the Primetime Emmy Awards the weekend after the Creative Arts Emmy Awards ( that ceremony was already set for August 16 )

It got so bad when we toured for '' Slippery When Wet '' that there were times I was freaking out … We indulged in everything that was on offer . But it was n't real , and what I wanted above all else was to be given credit for the work I put into the songs and into the recording … The problem was that I did n't notice how the image overtook what we were about . " Of the omission of recordings from this tour from '' One Wild Night Live 1985 – 2001 '' , Jon Bon Jovi remarked : " It makes sense for the '' Slippery '' tour not to be represented , because at that time I was dosed up on cortisone and my voice was shot .

" Sava noted that while the episode was humorous , much of the comedy was undercut by the tragic and distressing nature of Finn 's story . Andrew Tran of Overmental argued that " the episode ... dissects vividly that bottomless feeling of midlife wanderlust ... not the road-trippy , running-through-the-fields kind but rather the life-map-disappearing-in-your-hands , what-the-hell-is-next kind . " Tran contended that , through the use of video game tropes , explores the idea that life is ultimately unpredictable that there " is no map that you can make for yourself ( or that anyone can give you ) that can account for everything you ’re going to encounter " . " The Hall of Egress " has been highly lauded by the show 's production staff , with series creator Pendleton Ward in particular naming it as one of his favorites . According to the crew , " It was just so thoughtfully done . " At the 68th Primetime Emmy Awards in 2016 , " The Hall of Egress " was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Short-format Animation .

		CONTEXT=The dangers to journalists in Russia have been well known since the early 1990s but concern over the number of unsolved killings soared after Anna Politkovskaya 's murder in Moscow on 7 October 2006 . While international monitors mentioned a dozen deaths , some sources within Russia talked of over two hundred fatalities . The evidence has since been examined and documented in two reports , published in Russian and English , by international organizations . These revealed a basic confusion in terminology that explained the seemingly enormous numerical discrepancy : statistics of premature death among journalists ( from work accidents , crossfire incidents , and purely criminal or domestic cases of manslaughter ) were repeatedly equated with the much smaller number of targeted ( contract ) killings or work - related murders . The Remembrance Day of Journalists Killed in the Line of Duty in Russia is observed on 15 December every year .

		GOLD_MENTION=S7 Airlines Flight 778
		CONTEXT=Rasputin 's daughter Maria died in the 2006 crash of S7 Airlines Flight 778 , and his wife died six years later . He died in Moscow on 14 March 2015 , a day short of his 78th birthday . Patriarch Kirill of the Russian Orthodox Church conducted his funeral service , and President Vladimir Putin paid his respects . ( In 2014 Rasputin had co-signed a letter by writers in support of Putin 's annexation of the Crimea . ) Rasputin is closely associated with a movement in post-war Soviet literature known as " village prose , " or sometimes " rural prose " ( деревенская проза ) . Beginning in the time of the Khrushchev Thaw ( оттепель ) , village prose was praised for its stylistic and thematic departures from socialist realism . Village prose works usually focused on the hardships of the Soviet peasantry , espoused an idealized picture of traditional village life , and implicitly or explicitly criticized official modernization projects . Rasputin 's 1979 novel '' Farewell to Matyora '' , which depicts a fictional Siberian village which is to be evacuated and cleared so that a hydroelectric dam can be constructed further down the Angara River , was considered the epitome of this genre . The opening paragraph below is a good example of Rasputin 's writing style ( exceptional even for the village prose writers ) , and the novel 's theme of natural cycles disrupted by modernization : '' Once more spring had come , one more in the never-ending cycle , but for Matyora this spring would be the last , the last for both the island and the village that bore the same name . Once more , rumbling passionately , the ice broke , piling up mounds on the banks , and the liberated Angara River opened up , stretching out into a mighty , sparkling flow . Once more the water gushed boisterously at the island ’s upper tip , before cascading down both channels of the riverbed ; once more greenery flared on the ground and in the greens , the first rains soaked the earth , the swifts and swallows flew back , and at dusk in the bogs the awakened frogs croaked their love of life . It had all happened many times before . '' ( From Rasputin 's novel '' Farewell to Matyora '' , translated by Antonina W. Bouis , 1979 ) Rasputin 's nonfiction works contain similar themes , often in support of relevant political causes . He directed particularly trenchant criticism at large-scale dam building , like the project that flooded his own hometown , and water management projects , like the diversion of the Siberian rivers to Central Asia . He argued that these projects were destructive not simply in an ecological sense , but in a moral sense as well

In the wake of the devastating fires following the earthquake , many insurance companies fought paying their policyholders , often by quibbling over causality ( since the insurance was not for earthquakes ) , or paying only 75 % of the amounts due . This led to many lawsuits from policyholders . At least 14 insurers went bankrupt , and some insurers – mostly German and Austrian – simply disappeared and denied all coverage

		CONTEXT=The pattern of displacement along the Imperial Fault was very similar to that observed for the northern part of the rupture during the 1940 El Centro earthquake , although on this occasion the rupture did not extend across the border into Mexico . This had been explained as the behavior of individual slip patches along the Imperial Fault with two patches rupturing in 1940 and only the northern one in 1979 . The faulting that gave rise to the earthquake has been modeled by comparing synthetic seismograms with near-source strong motion recordings . This analysis showed that the rupture speed had at times exceeded the shear wave velocity , making this the first earthquake for which supershear rupture was inferred

		GOLD_MENTION=1896 Sanriku earthquake
		CONTEXT=Slower than normal rupture propagation is associated with the presence of relatively mechanically weak material in the fault zone . This is particularly the case for some megathrust earthquakes , where the rupture velocity is about 1.0 km per second . These tsunami earthquakes are dangerous because most of the energy release happens at lower frequencies than normal earthquakes and they lack the peaks of seismic wave activity that would alert coastal populations to a possible tsunami risk . Typically the surface wave magnitude for such an event is much smaller than moment magnitude as the former does not capture the longer wavelength energy release . The 1896 Sanriku earthquake went almost unnoticed , but the associated tsunami killed more than 22,000 people

I am absolutely convinced that the main task here is raiding with the help of the State . The goal is to take Baturina 's business from her for a pittance . And criminal cases are just the way to do it . It 's disgusting to take part in marauding , and I will never do it . Thus , the story of my conflict with Baturina is from now one completely over . " Luzhkov was dismissed by President Medvedev on 28 September 2010 , after returning from a holiday in Austria , citing " loss of trust " , a traditional Russian legal formula for dishonorable dismissal . In recent years , the Kremlin had consistently been replacing old regional heads , elected already during Boris Yeltsin 's time , with younger candidates . Pundits had been predicting Luzhkov 's imminent ousting for years . The September 2010 dismissal followed weeks of speculation regarding Luzhkov 's position , caused by his questioning of Medvedev 's leadership . Luzhkov had recently criticised Medvedev 's decision to halt the construction of a new highway through the Khimki Forest amid protests by environmentalists . Luzkhov had also called for a " stronger leadership " of Russia . Government-controlled television channels had run programmes criticising Luzhkov 's handling of the 2010 summer peat fires and accused him and his wife of corruption . Some observers have seen this as being part of a struggle between Medvedev and then-Prime Minister Putin . Luzhkov has officially declared that he has left the United Russia party . Luzhkov had sent a letter to the President on the 27th of September criticising Medvedev 's policy and his administration 's actions . According to the President 's press-secretary Medvedev read the letter after the decision had been made but it would not have affected his decision in any case

		GOLD_MENTION=S7 Airlines Flight 778
		CONTEXT=Rasputin 's daughter Maria died in the 2006 crash of S7 Airlines Flight 778 , and his wife died six years later . He died in Moscow on 14 March 2015 , a day short of his 78th birthday . Patriarch Kirill of the Russian Orthodox Church conducted his funeral service , and President Vladimir Putin paid his respects . ( In 2014 Rasputin had co-signed a letter by writers in support of Putin 's annexation of the Crimea . ) Rasputin is closely associated with a movement in post-war Soviet literature known as " village prose , " or sometimes " rural prose " ( деревенская проза ) . Beginning in the time of the Khrushchev Thaw ( оттепель ) , village prose was praised for its stylistic and thematic departures from socialist realism . Village prose works usually focused on the hardships of the Soviet peasantry , espoused an idealized picture of traditional village life , and implicitly or explicitly criticized official modernization projects . Rasputin 's 1979 novel '' Farewell to Matyora '' , which depicts a fictional Siberian village which is to be evacuated and cleared so that a hydroelectric dam can be constructed further down the Angara River , was considered the epitome of this genre . The opening paragraph below is a good example of Rasputin 's writing style ( exceptional even for the village prose writers ) , and the novel 's theme of natural cycles disrupted by modernization : '' Once more spring had come , one more in the never-ending cycle , but for Matyora this spring would be the last , the last for both the island and the village that bore the same name . Once more , rumbling passionately , the ice broke , piling up mounds on the banks , and the liberated Angara River opened up , stretching out into a mighty , sparkling flow . Once more the water gushed boisterously at the island ’s upper tip , before cascading down both channels of the riverbed ; once more greenery flared on the ground and in the greens , the first rains soaked the earth , the swifts and swallows flew back , and at dusk in the bogs the awakened frogs croaked their love of life . It had all happened many times before . '' ( From Rasputin 's novel '' Farewell to Matyora '' , translated by Antonina W. Bouis , 1979 ) Rasputin 's nonfiction works contain similar themes , often in support of relevant political causes . He directed particularly trenchant criticism at large-scale dam building , like the project that flooded his own hometown , and water management projects , like the diversion of the Siberian rivers to Central Asia . He argued that these projects were destructive not simply in an ecological sense , but in a moral sense as well

		CONTEXT=Early test screenings did not go well , with the strong violence in some scenes being too much . At the first test screening , eighty people walked out during a graphic torture scene involving Johnnie Farragut . Lynch decided not to cut anything from the film and at the second screening one hundred people walked out during this scene . Lynch remembers , " By then , I knew the scene was killing the film . So I cut it to the degree that it was powerful but did n't send people running from the theatre " . In retrospect , the filmmaker said , " But that was part of what '' Wild at Heart '' was about : really insane and sick and twisted stuff going on . " The film was completed one day before it debuted at the 1990 Cannes Film Festival in the 2,400-seat Grand Auditorium . After the screening , it received " wild cheering " from the audience . When Jury President Bernardo Bertolucci announced '' Wild at Heart '' as the Palme d'Or winner at the awards ceremony , the boos almost drowned out the cheers , with film critic Roger Ebert leading the vocal detractors . Barry Gifford remembers that there was a prevailing mood that the media was hoping Lynch would fail . " All kinds of journalists were trying to cause controversy and have me say something like ' This is nothing like the book ' or ' He ruined my book ' . I think everybody from '' Time '' magazine to '' What 's On In London '' was disappointed when I said ' This is fantastic . This is wonderful . It 's like a big , dark , musical comedy ' "

		CONTEXT=" Metaphors of a Magnifico " is a poem from Wallace Stevens 's first book of poetry , Harmonium ( 1923 ) . It was first published in 1918 , so it is in the public domain . The poem experiments with perspective . It explores the difference between detached reportage in its various foci : twenty men , a single bridge , a village ; twenty villages ; or one man , one bridge , one village , on one hand and immediate lived experience – the boots , the boards , the first white wall of the village rising through the first fruit trees on the other . Stevens ' preference for immediate lived experience addressed in his scornful treatment of William Carlos Williams in " Nuances of a Theme by Williams " , is what commentators have in mind when they speak of his sensualism . Magnifico may be one of those men crossing the bridge , shifting from viewing himself and the world from various external perspectives to the first - person viewpoint ( " Of what was it I was thinking " ? ) . What explicitly will not declare itself is subjective experience , and yet it declares itself through the action of the poem . The meanings that enable objective description of the world do not declare themselves , and yet the poem ends with them in a reduction that is an usurpation of the subjective .

		CONTEXT=In 1983 , Chéreau directed the film '' The Wounded Man ( L'Homme Blessé '' ) , a more personal project for him . He and his co-writer , Hervé Guibert , worked for six years on the scenario , which tells of a love affair between an older man involved in prostitution and a teenage boy , a dark view in the context of HIV/AIDS . His 1994 film was '' La Reine Margot '' , based on the 1845 historical novel of the same name by Alexandre Dumas . It won the Jury Prize and Best Actress Award ( Virna Lisi ) at Cannes , as well as five César Awards . Set in the 16th-century , depicting the conflict between Catholics and Protestants in France , it shows battles and the St Bartholomew 's day massacre . A scene of the queen with the head of her lover is reminiscent of the opera '' Salome '' , uniting cult and obsession ( " Einheit von Kult und Obsession " ) , as Koch remarks . The film was Chéreau 's longest , most expensive production , and his greatest financial success . " I t was erotic and violent , and offers poured in from Hollywood , " but , he said , " I was always being offered films based in the Renaissance and involving a massacre . I even had an offer from the UK to do a film about Guy Fawkes . " He refused similar offers : " It 's useless to repeat something you already did . " In 1993 , in a rare acting role , he appeared as General Montcalm in Michael Mann 's '' The Last of the Mohicans ''

		CONTEXT=In 1988 , the party made '' The Next Step '' into a bulletin for its supporters . Later that year , a monthly magazine called '' Living Marxism '' was set up for a wider readership . Despite its beginnings as a far-left outlet , the politics espoused by the magazine developed a pronounced libertarianism . In December 1990 , '' Living Marxism '' ran an article which argued that the corrosive effect of the collapse of both Stalinism and reformism on the working class meant that " for the time being at least , the working class has no political existence " . In 1997 , the point was put more forcefully : In today 's circumstances class politics can not be reinvented , rebuilt , reinvigorated or rescued . Why ? Because any dynamic political outlook needs to exist in an interaction with existing individual consciousness . And contemporary forms of consciousness in our atomised societies can not be used as the foundation for a more developed politics of solidarity . Between 1990 and 1997 , the party developed the view that more than capitalism itself the danger facing humanity was the absence of a force for social change ( in philosophical language , a " subject " of history ) and the culture of low expectations that suppressed it . Prefacing a 1996 '' Living Marxism '' manifesto , Mick Hume argued : Of course ... we could have produced a familiar list of left-wing slogans complaining about problems like unemployment , exploitation and poverty which continue to scar our society . But that would be to ignore the transformation which has taken place in the political climate ... . At different times , different issues matter most . Each era has thrown up its own great questions which define which side you are on ... . A t '' Living Marxism '' , we see our job today as doing much more than criticising capitalism . That is the easy bit . There is a more pressing need to criticise the fatalistic critics , to counter the doom-mongers and put a positive case for human action in pursuit of social liberation . ... D ealing with ... unconventional questions , and puncturing the anti-human prejudices which surround them , is the precondition for making political action possible in our time . In February 1997 , shortly after the party disbanded , '' Living Marxism '' re-branded as '' LM '' , possibly to further distance itself from its leftist origins . Articles in '' LM '' argued : This magazine ran at least two articles in which the authors argued that the mass murder carried out in Rwanda in 1994 should not be described as genocide . In December 1995 , '' LM '' carried a report from an aid worker in Rwanda which argued : The lesson I would draw from my visit is that we must reject the term ' genocide ' in Rwanda . It has been used inside and outside Rwanda to criminalise the majority of ordinary Rwandan people , to justify outside interference in the country 's affairs , and to lend legitimacy to a minority military government imposed on Rwanda by Western powers . '' LM '' continued to create controversy on a variety of issues , most notably on the British Independent Television News ( ITN ) coverage of the Balkan conflict in the 1990s . The controversy centred on '' LM '' featuring an article by Thomas Deichmann in which he alleged that the ITN coverage of a refugee detention centre in Trnopolje during the conflict gave the false impression that the Bosnian Muslims were being held against their will in Serbian concentration camps . The ensuing libel award and costs arising from legal action by the ITN against '' LM '' were estimated to total around £ 1 million . The action bankrupted the magazine and its publishers

		GOLD_MENTION=Sundance last January
		CONTEXT=On January 27 , 2011 the festival sent 9 filmmakers to 9 cities across the US to screen and discuss their films . The cities and films included : Bob Tourtellotte of Reuters wrote " Sundance 2011 has proven to be exceptionally strong , audiences and filmmakers seem to agree . " Tourtellotte reported that Robert Redford said that three years ago the Sundance Institute " set out to get back to its roots of supporting alternative voices in cinema and he felt like this year that strategy paid off . " Redford said " This year , what has excited me , is I think the quality is increasing in diversity and is increasing in depth . " The AP reported that Redford said it 's " always a relief " when the festival ends because " it 's really exhausting . " Kenneth Turan , film critic for the '' Los Angeles Times '' , wrote " though the festival has gotten ever bigger — and ( thankfully ) more efficient in moving its close to 50,000 attendees in and out of its far-flung theaters — it still retains the scrappy , antic spirit that has animated it from the start . " Turan wrote " One of the paradoxes of Sundance is that the quirkiness and charm around the edges of the festival are not always fully appreciated because so much of the media focus is on the premieres section and the U.S. dramatic competition " which he said " are , frankly , often the weakest parts of the festival . " Turan said " Sundance 's insistence on giving equal weight to documentaries and dramas has made it into as important a nonfiction showcase as any festival in the world ; witness the fact that four out of the five Oscar-nominated docs this year debuted at Sundance last January . " He also wrote that the foreign language film competition " is a strength at Sundance , and yet that field is given even less popular attention than the documentaries . " Peter Knegt wrote that this year 's festival " probably wo n't replicate last year 's Oscar record . " He said " Despite a huge surge in sales , this year 's Sundance slate looks like it might be the least Oscar-friendly in some time . " He noted that the U.S. Dramatic Grand Jury Prize winners have been nominated for Best Picture for two years ( referring to '' Precious '' and '' Winter 's Bone '' ) . Knegt speculated on films that might be nominated for the Oscars . Films he deemed " most likely to succeed " at being nominated included : '' Like Crazy '' for Best Picture , Michael Shannon of '' Take Shelter '' for Best Actor , Elizabeth Olsen of '' Martha Marcy May Marlene '' for Best Actress , Felicity Jones of '' Like Crazy '' for Best Actress , Jessica Chastain of '' Take Shelter '' for Best Supporting Actress , '' Project Nim '' for Best Documentary Feature , '' Page One '' for Best Documentary Feature , and '' The Interrupters '' for Best Documentary Feature . He wrote " It 's reasonable to feel assured that at least one of Sundance 's docs will end up an Oscar nominee , if not two , three or four . " Jada Yuan of '' New York '' magazine wrote " perhaps the biggest highlight of the festival is just how ripe it 's been for acquisitions , with nearly 30 films getting picked up , the most at any Sundance ever . " On " why everyone is suddenly so bullish on independent film " , Owen Gleiberman wrote that the " energy and optimism at Sundance this year was n't just hype . " He said the factors he thought were driving a new evolving vision of the indie film world included : " The deals have n’t gotten cheaper — they 've gotten smarter " , a belief that last year 's new festival director John Cooper and director of programming Trevor Groth " have re-energized the festival , heightening its quality and organizing the movies with a tempting new shape and vision " , video on demand gives distributors a safety net and more confidence , and the audiences for Sundance movies are not going away , saying " The Oscars ... have become a testament to the central place that Sundance movies now occupy . " Redford was happy about the success of the festival , with about 45 films being sold vs 14 in 2010 , an increase of about 220 % . Redford said studios are realizing " there are audiences " for indie films

		CONTEXT=Film scholars Jean-Paul Berthomé and François Thomas have called '' Don Quixote '' " the archetype of an unfinished Welles film , unfinished because it was unfinishable . … Welles is almost certainly alone among major filmmakers in having invented the means to allow himself to assert his full right not to show his work to the public until he judged the moment had come , even if that meant he never showed it at all . " In May 1986 , the first public exhibition of the '' Don Quixote '' footage was shown at the Cannes Film Festival . The footage consisted of 45 minutes of scenes and outtakes from the film , assembled by the archivists from the Cinémathèque Française and supervised by the director Costa-Gavras
