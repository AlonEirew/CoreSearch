" Television critic Frazier Moore commented that Rock 's performance was a " needed pick-me-up , presiding over the broadcast with saucy finesse . " He added , " In sum , the broadcast felt brisk , though not rushed . It felt modern and refreshingly free of chronic self-importance . " Brian Lowry of '' Variety '' gave an average review of Rock but remarked , " For all the hand-wringing about the awards descending into the muck , the 77th Academy Awards proved a classy affair , with precious little red meat to satiate Hollywood bashers .
