		GOLD_MENTION=London bombings
		CONTEXT=In a May 2005 column in the '' Weekly Standard '' , Daveed Gartenstein-Ross wrote about his May 14 , 2005 , debate with Bray on PAX-TV 's Faith Under Fire program . He noted that a '' Chicago Tribune '' article had detailed how the fundamentalist Islamist Muslim Brotherhood operates in the US through MAS , and that MAS wants to see the US governed by sharia law . He noted that MAS , " except in its most public of statements " , was open about its agenda . He argued that while Bray " tries to portray MAS as an organization that embraces these shared liberal democratic values , the group simultaneously teaches its members that all government should become Islamic and that non-Islamic judicial systems should be boycotted . " In July 2005 , after the London bombings that killed 52 people , Bray said : " Let me say to the terrorists very clearly , that you will have no comfort in our community . Our community offers you no harbor . Our message is clear , you do no service to Islam , you do a great disservice to Islam and for the love of God , stop this madness . " When the '' Philadelphia Inquirer '' published some of the cartoons of Mohammed in the 2005 Mohammed cartoons controversy , Bray said : " This has nothing to do with free speech ; its pure sensationalism that reeks of religious disrespect . What the '' Philadelphia Inquirer '' has done is irresponsible , provocative , and reckless . " When in November 2006 , two imams from Boston-area mosques were arrested and charged with being involved in a scheme that secured religious worker visas for immigrants who instead got secular jobs , Bray said : " If this was sic clerics who were anything other than Muslims , would they have had to face this ? " After the September 2007 resignation of Esam Omeish from a Virginia Commission on Immigration , after it was revealed that he had publicly endorsed " the jihad way " in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict , Bray said " What 's the big news ? Everybody knows Muslims feel passionately about the Palestinian issue . What in the world is wrong about talking about the invasion of Lebanon or the plight of the Palestinian people ? " Bray served on the Board of Directors of the Interfaith Alliance and the National Interfaith Committee for Worker Justice , and is a National Co-convener of Religions for Peace-USA . He is a Washington , DC , television and radio talk show host , and has appeared on CBS News , Fox , MSNBC , CNN , C-SPAN , Aljazeera , and many TV and radio talk shows . Bray also organized protests against the U.S. war in Afghanistan , the Iraq war , and the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza

		CONTEXT=Since the early 2000s , Sinai has been the site of several terror attacks against tourists , the majority of whom are Egyptian . Investigations have shown that these were mainly motivated by a resentment of the poverty faced by many Bedouin in the area . Attacking the tourist industry was viewed as a method of damaging the industry so that the government would pay more attention to their situation . ( See 2004 Sinai bombings , 2005 Sharm El Sheikh bombings and 2006 Dahab bombings ) . Since the 2011 Egyptian Revolution , unrest has become more prevalent in the area including the 2012 Egyptian-Israeli border attack in which 16 Egyptian soldiers were killed by militants . ( See Sinai insurgency . ) Also on the rise are kidnappings of refugees . According to Meron Estifanos , Eritrean refugees are often kidnapped by Bedouin in the northern Sinai , tortured , raped , and only released after receiving a large ransom

		CONTEXT=The UK government had investigated expelling Bakri even before the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 , and in July 2003 the headquarters of al-Muhajiroun , and the homes of Bakri and Choudary , were raided by the police . The following year , under new anti-terrorist legislation , the government announced that it wanted to ban al-Muhajiroun . In 2005 Bakri learned that he was at risk of prosecution for his support of the 7 July 2005 London bombers , and in August left the UK for Lebanon , where he claimed that he was on holiday . After leaving a television station where he said " I will not return to Britain unless I want to go there as a visitor or as a tourist " , he was detained by Lebanon 's general security department and held in a Beirut prison . Several days later , Bakri was excluded from returning to Britain by the Home Secretary , Charles Clarke , on the grounds that his presence in Britain was " not conducive to the public good . " Choudary condemned the decision and demanded to know what Bakri had done to justify the ban . He claimed that ministers were inventing rules to ensure that Bakri could not return . In November , Choudary and three other followers of Bakri were deported from Lebanon and returned to the UK . Choudary blamed the Foreign and Commonwealth Office for orchestrating their deportations , claiming that the four were there to help Bakri set up a madrasah

		GOLD_MENTION=Hollywood Film Festival Award
		CONTEXT=Hunt starred in Woody Allen 's '' The Curse of the Jade Scorpion '' ( 2001 ) , as an efficiency expert hypnotized by a crooked hypnotist into stealing jewels . Despite the film 's limited success , Roger Ebert asserted : " Hunt in particular has fun with a wisecracking dame role that owes something , perhaps , to Rosalind Russell in '' His Girl Friday '' . " In 2003 , Hunt returned to Broadway in Yasmina Reza 's '' Life x 3 '' , and in 2004 , she starred in the drama '' A Good Woman '' , as a femme fatale in 1930s NYC . '' AV Club '' , in its review for the latter , remarked : " Helen Hunt looks embarrassingly out of place trying to play an infamous seductress " . She played a socialite , as part of an ensemble cast , in Emilio Estevez 's drama '' Bobby '' ( 2006 ) , about the hours leading up to the Robert F. Kennedy assassination . As a member of the cast , she was nominated for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Cast in a Motion Picture but won the Hollywood Film Festival Award for Best Ensemble Cast . Hunt made her feature film directorial debut in '' Then She Found Me '' ( 2007 ) , in which she also starred as a 39-year-old Brooklyn elementary school teacher , who after years is contacted by the flamboyant host of a local talk show , played by Bette Midler , who introduces herself as her biological mother . After first reading Elinor Lipman 's novel , she tried to interest numerous studios in the material , and her unsuccessful efforts led her to begin writing the screenplay and raising funds to produce it herself . Upon its release , Ruthe Stein of the '' San Francisco Chronicle '' observed , " You would think that frontloading '' Then She Found Me '' with so much plot would make it play like a soap opera . But Hunt saves the movie from this fate in two ways . First she turns in a touchingly real performance , the best of her big-screen career . Forget that '' As Good as It Gets '' won her an Oscar . She 's eons better and more realistic in this one ... By directing '' Then She Found Me '' , Helen becomes its savior as well ... Hunt knows when to rein in the Divine Miss M instead of allowing her to go into full Kabuki mode . She also coaxes pitch-perfect performances from Broderick and Firth . " Hunt starred in the dramedy '' Every Day '' ( 2010 ) , as one half of a married couple pulled apart by increasing responsibilities . According to '' Los Angeles Times '' , the film " comes as a reminder of Hunt 's talent for understatement , and a wish to see more of her " . In the biographical drama '' Soul Surfer '' ( 2011 ) , she played the mother of the Hawaiian-born champion surfer Bethany Hamilton , on whose life the film was based . Her first wide release since 2001 's '' The Curse of the Jade Scorpion '' , '' Soul Surfer '' made US$ 47.1 million internationally . Hunt starred as sex surrogate Cheryl Cohen-Greene in '' The Sessions '' ( 2012 ) , alongside John Hawkes and William H. Macy . The role required Hunt to perform multiple scenes of full-frontal nudity , on which she further said : " Being naked was challenging , but even more than that was the vulnerability . I felt vulnerable because I was naked . I felt vulnerable because we were having such a vulnerable moment in this character 's life . This was a real journey that someone had gone on , and I wanted to do right by that . " Her performance was acclaimed by critics and earned her several award nominations , including an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress . Todd McCarthy of '' The Hollywood Reporter '' wrote : " Hunt 's performance may be physically bold but is equally marked by its maturity and composure . " Hunt played research geneticist Mary-Claire King in the independent drama '' Decoding Annie Parker '' ( 2013 ) , which was released to a mixed critical response . She wrote and directed the drama '' Ride '' ( 2014 ) , in which she also starred as a mother who travels cross-country to California to be with her son after he decides to drop out of school and become a surfer . Rotten Tomatoes ' critical consensus read : " '' Ride '' reaffirms Helen Hunt 's immense acting talent — but suggests that she still needs time to develop as a director . " In '' The Miracle Season '' ( 2018 ) , based on the true story of the Iowa City West High School volleyball team , Hunt played Kathy Bresnahan , a volleyball coach

		CONTEXT=Hunt starred in Woody Allen 's '' The Curse of the Jade Scorpion '' ( 2001 ) , as an efficiency expert hypnotized by a crooked hypnotist into stealing jewels . Despite the film 's limited success , Roger Ebert asserted : " Hunt in particular has fun with a wisecracking dame role that owes something , perhaps , to Rosalind Russell in '' His Girl Friday '' . " In 2003 , Hunt returned to Broadway in Yasmina Reza 's '' Life x 3 '' , and in 2004 , she starred in the drama '' A Good Woman '' , as a femme fatale in 1930s NYC . '' AV Club '' , in its review for the latter , remarked : " Helen Hunt looks embarrassingly out of place trying to play an infamous seductress " . She played a socialite , as part of an ensemble cast , in Emilio Estevez 's drama '' Bobby '' ( 2006 ) , about the hours leading up to the Robert F. Kennedy assassination . As a member of the cast , she was nominated for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Cast in a Motion Picture but won the Hollywood Film Festival Award for Best Ensemble Cast . Hunt made her feature film directorial debut in '' Then She Found Me '' ( 2007 ) , in which she also starred as a 39-year-old Brooklyn elementary school teacher , who after years is contacted by the flamboyant host of a local talk show , played by Bette Midler , who introduces herself as her biological mother . After first reading Elinor Lipman 's novel , she tried to interest numerous studios in the material , and her unsuccessful efforts led her to begin writing the screenplay and raising funds to produce it herself . Upon its release , Ruthe Stein of the '' San Francisco Chronicle '' observed , " You would think that frontloading '' Then She Found Me '' with so much plot would make it play like a soap opera . But Hunt saves the movie from this fate in two ways . First she turns in a touchingly real performance , the best of her big-screen career . Forget that '' As Good as It Gets '' won her an Oscar . She 's eons better and more realistic in this one ... By directing '' Then She Found Me '' , Helen becomes its savior as well ... Hunt knows when to rein in the Divine Miss M instead of allowing her to go into full Kabuki mode . She also coaxes pitch-perfect performances from Broderick and Firth . " Hunt starred in the dramedy '' Every Day '' ( 2010 ) , as one half of a married couple pulled apart by increasing responsibilities . According to '' Los Angeles Times '' , the film " comes as a reminder of Hunt 's talent for understatement , and a wish to see more of her " . In the biographical drama '' Soul Surfer '' ( 2011 ) , she played the mother of the Hawaiian-born champion surfer Bethany Hamilton , on whose life the film was based . Her first wide release since 2001 's '' The Curse of the Jade Scorpion '' , '' Soul Surfer '' made US$ 47.1 million internationally . Hunt starred as sex surrogate Cheryl Cohen-Greene in '' The Sessions '' ( 2012 ) , alongside John Hawkes and William H. Macy . The role required Hunt to perform multiple scenes of full-frontal nudity , on which she further said : " Being naked was challenging , but even more than that was the vulnerability . I felt vulnerable because I was naked . I felt vulnerable because we were having such a vulnerable moment in this character 's life . This was a real journey that someone had gone on , and I wanted to do right by that . " Her performance was acclaimed by critics and earned her several award nominations , including an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress . Todd McCarthy of '' The Hollywood Reporter '' wrote : " Hunt 's performance may be physically bold but is equally marked by its maturity and composure . " Hunt played research geneticist Mary-Claire King in the independent drama '' Decoding Annie Parker '' ( 2013 ) , which was released to a mixed critical response . She wrote and directed the drama '' Ride '' ( 2014 ) , in which she also starred as a mother who travels cross-country to California to be with her son after he decides to drop out of school and become a surfer . Rotten Tomatoes ' critical consensus read : " '' Ride '' reaffirms Helen Hunt 's immense acting talent — but suggests that she still needs time to develop as a director . " In '' The Miracle Season '' ( 2018 ) , based on the true story of the Iowa City West High School volleyball team , Hunt played Kathy Bresnahan , a volleyball coach

On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes , the show holds an approval rating of 43 % based on 30 critics , and summarized , " The 90th Academy Awards played it safe and hit no major snags -- but by clocking in at over four hours , returning host Jimmy Kimmel and company wore out their welcome long before the surprise ending . " Hank Stuever of '' The Washington Post '' marked , " In his second year , Kimmel has shown that the telecast need n't be anything but sharp and sure , with a funny host whose bits are manageable , shareable and – best of all – forgotten . We 're not making showbiz history here ; we 're just trying to get through another Oscar night . " Chief critic David Edelstein of '' Vulture '' wrote , " This was the best , most inspiring , and most sheerly likable Academy Awards telecast I 've ever seen . ... It was also – in terms of the actual awards – among the most disappointing . " '' Vanity Fair '' s , Richard Lawson wrote , " As a host , Kimmel struck a careful , appropriately measured tone ... All told , Sunday 's ceremony did an admirable job of recognizing all the turmoil surrounding it while maintaining the silly , chintzy trappings that so many of us tune into the Oscars for . " CNN 's Brian Lowry quipped , " The Oscars are a big , unwieldy beast , which invariably try to serve too many masters . Yet if the intent was ultimately to maintain a celebratory tone without ignoring either the outside world or the elephant in the room throughout this year 's awards , host Jimmy Kimmel and the show itself largely succeeded . " Others were more critical of the show . Television critic Maureen Ryan of '' Variety '' said , " All things considered , the show had a more or less low-key vibe . Normally it takes about two hours for the numbing effect to set in , but despite host Jimmy Kimmel 's best efforts , Sunday 's telecast started to feel a bit languid and low-energy far earlier . " Television critic James Poniewozik of '' The New York Times '' said , " despite the recent upheaval in Hollywood , the ceremony at large still focused mainly on celebration and glitter literally , in the case of the blinding set , which looked as if the ceremony were encased in an enormous geode . There 's also the perennial problem of bloat . The hitch , of course , is that every part of the show has its constituency . " Darren Franich of '' Entertainment Weekly '' wrote , " What fun we had at this year 's Oscars ! Long show , sure , but where to cut it ? " Writing for '' Deadline '' Greg Evans said , " Did the nearly four-hour running time contain any moments for the Oscar ages ? Probably not . " David Wiegand of the '' San Francisco Chronicle '' wrote , " Even the hope that the noise of clapping might keep the audience at home and in the theater awake , there was little of that for anything except the entrance of actors of advance age . " '' The Oregonian '' columnist Kristi Turnquist wrote , " Was it respectful ? Absolutely . Did it make for kind of a dull , earnest Oscars show ? Yeah , kind of . " Attaining 26.5 million U.S. viewers according to Nielsen ratings , the ceremony 's telecast had a 16-percent drop in viewership from last year 's ceremony and had the lowest U.S. viewership in Oscar history . On March 6 , after the final ratings were confirmed , President Donald Trump took to his Twitter account , saying , " Lowest rated Oscars in HISTORY . Problem is , we do n't have stars anymore – except your President ( just kidding , of course ) ! " . In response , Kimmel also tweeted , saying , " Thanks , lowest rated President in HISTORY .

		CONTEXT=Pope Pius XII 's response to the Roman razzia ( Italian for roundup ) , or mass deportation of Jews , on October 16 , 1943 is a significant issue relating to Pope Pius XII and the Holocaust . Under Mussolini , no policy of abduction of Jews had been implemented in Italy . Following the capitulation of Italy in 1943 , Nazi forces invaded and occupied much of the country , and began deportations of Jews to extermination camps . Pius XII protested at diplomatic levels , while several thousand Jews found refuge in Catholic networks , institutions and homes across Italy , including in Vatican City and Pope Pius ' Summer Residence . The Catholic Church and some historians have credited this rescue in large part to the direction of Pope Pius XII . However , historian Susan Zuccotti researched the matter in detail and discovered that although the pope was aware of the Holocaust , he did not issue a rescue order . Zuccotti states that there is " considerable evidence of papal disapproval of the hiding of Jews and other fugitives in Vatican properties . "

According to the secret Treaty of London and the Treaty of Rapallo in 1920 , the former Austrian Littoral and western part of the former Inner Carniola were annexed to the Kingdom of Italy . Whereas only a few thousand Italians were left in the new South Slavic state , a population of half a million Slavs , both Slovenes and Croats , was subjected to forced Italianization until the fall of Fascism in Italy . Most of the region known as the Slovenian Littoral was transferred to Yugoslavia under the terms of the Treaty of Peace with Italy , 1947 .

		CONTEXT=I vitelloni ( ; lit . " The Bullocks / The layabouts " ) is a 1953 Italian comedy - drama directed by Federico Fellini from a screenplay by Fellini , Ennio Flaiano and Tullio Pinelli . The film launched the career of Alberto Sordi , one of post-war Italy 's most significant and popular comedians , who stars with Franco Fabrizi and Franco Interlenghi in a story of five young Italian men at crucial turning points in their small town lives . Recognized as a pivotal work in the director 's artistic evolution , the film has distinct autobiographical elements that mirror important societal changes in 1950s Italy . Recipient of both the Venice Film Festival Silver Lion in 1953 , and an Academy Award nomination for Best Writing in 1958 , the film 's success restored Fellini 's reputation after the commercial failure of The White Sheik ( 1952 ) .

		CONTEXT=In Italy as in other countries the outbreak of the First World War created new opportunities and channels for propaganda . The unusual circumstances of Italy ’s entry into the war meant that the government played no active role in propaganda work during the early years of the war . Public opinion was served by a pro-war nationalist press that avoided the unpleasant details of life in the front , while the army regarded discipline as more important than morale , leaving soldiers ’ welfare to the Church . The momentous Italian defeat at Caporetto saw an end to this laissez - faire approach and the beginnings of a more centralised and managed effort to motivate the public and the army to the national cause .

		CONTEXT=the dogs of war is a phrase spoken by Mark Antony in Act 3 , Scene 1 , line 273 of William Shakespeare 's '' Julius Caesar '' : " Cry ' Havoc ! , ' and let slip the dogs of war . " In the scene , Mark Antony is alone with Julius Caesar 's body , shortly after Caesar 's assassination . In a soliloquy , he reveals his intention to incite the crowd at Caesar 's funeral to rise up against the assassins . Foreseeing violence throughout Italy , Antony even imagines Caesar 's spirit joining in the exhortations : " ranging for revenge , with Ate by his side come hot from hell , shall in these confines with a Monarch 's voice cry ' Havoc ! ' and let slip the dogs of war . " In a literal reading , " dogs " are the familiar animals , trained for warfare ; " havoc " is a military order permitting the seizure of spoil after a victory and " let slip " is to release from the leash . Shakespeare 's source for '' Julius Caesar '' was '' The Life of Marcus Brutus '' from Plutarch 's '' Lives '' , and the concept of the war dog appears in that work , in the section devoted to the Greek warrior Aratus

		CONTEXT=Acting eventually became her focus , and she became particularly known for her film work with Rainer Werner Fassbinder . During the making of '' Effi Briest '' ( 1974 ) , an adaptation of a German novel by Theodor Fontane , Fassbinder and Schygulla fell out over divergent interpretations of the character . Another issue for Schygulla was low pay , and she led a revolt against Fassbinder during the making of '' Effi Briest '' , shot in September 1972 some time before its commercial release . His response was typically blunt : " I ca n't stand the sight of your face any more . You bust my balls " . They did not work together again for several years until '' The Marriage of Maria Braun '' in 1978 . The film was entered into the 29th Berlin International Film Festival , where she won the Silver Bear for Best Actress for her performance . In 1980 she acted in Fassbinder 's miniseries adaptation of '' Berlin Alexanderplatz ''

		CONTEXT=The film was not the official German submission to the 51st Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film . Instead Hans W. Geißendörfer 's '' The Glass Cell '' was chosen to be the official German submission . Almost one year later the film was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 37th Golden Globe Awards , but this success was overshadowed by the success of Volker Schlöndorff 's '' The Tin Drum '' at the 52nd Academy Awards . The commercial success of '' The Marriage of Maria Braun '' strengthened the negotiation position of Fassbinder in his subsequent film projects . He received a financing agreement for one of his favorite projects based on Pitigrilli 's novel '' Cocaine '' and was able to increase the budget for '' Berlin Alexanderplatz '' . Several German commercial film producers expressed an interest in making films with Fassbinder . The seasoned film producer Luggi Waldleitner would produce the Fassbinder film '' Lili Marleen '' with Hanna Schygulla in the main role . Horst Wendlandt would produce the two other films in the BRD Trilogy , '' Lola '' and '' Veronika Voss '' . His success also allowed him to realize his last project , '' Querelle '' which was co-financed by Gaumont

		CONTEXT=In 2015 , Arnab Goswami , the former editor-in-chief of India 's most popular English news channel Times Now , criticised the hegemony of Western media has ruined the balance of power that is required . He also supported his argument by citing that US and UK together contribute 74 % of the source of global news , whereas all of Asia contributes only 3 % . He said . " If I had to summarise that in one line , it basically says that Indians are the ' least insular people , most open-minded ' , ' Americans are the most insular people ' , but they have complete dominance over the global narrative in terms of news . " Following the Chinese 2014 Kunming attack , in which Uyghur Muslim Xinjiang secessionists killed 31 people , Chinese state media and Chinese social media users criticized major Western media outlets that placed quotation marks around the word " terrorism " in news articles about the event . While some Chinese Internet users interpreted the quotation marks as attribution to the statements of the Chinese government , others accused the Western media of sympathizing with the separatists . China accused " Western commentators , with their focus on Uighur rights , of hypocrisy and double standards on terrorism . " Russian media and government often claims that Western media is biased against Russia . Human Rights Watch wrote in 2018 that the Russian Foreign Ministry has promoted conspiracy theories about " the Western media " and denounced critical news coverage . In 2005 , Russia established Russia Today ( later RT ) ; Julia Ioffe , writing in the '' Columbia Journalism Review '' , writes that RT was established as a soft power and propaganda instrument , aimed at countering Western media outlets and promoting Russian foreign policy . In the second half of 2012 , between 2.25 and 2.5 million Britons watched RT broadcasting ( making it the third-most watched rolling news channel in Britain , behind BBC News and Sky News ) . An article by Andrei P. Tsygankov on editorials in the '' New York Times '' , '' Washington Post '' , and '' Wall Street Journal '' related to Russian domestic politics from 2008 to 2014 found that the editorials were overwhelmingly negative of the Russian government , based on such issues as " elections , opposition and minority rights , the justice system , protection of property rights , freedom of media , development of NGOs and civil society , protection of citizens against crime and terrorism , mechanisms for the transfer of power , attitudes of Putin and Medvedev , and relations with Western nations . " Tsygankov asserted that the editorials failed to adequately reflect " neutral and positive frames and such as those stressing the country 's relative progress or objective difficulties faced in its development . " By contrast , James Nixey of the Russia and Eurasia Programme at Chatham House argued that fair reporting does not require false equivalence between Russian and Western actions , and that negative coverage of Russia was understandable given its conduct in Crimea , Georgia , and Syria , and its poor human rights record . Piers Robinson argues that both Russian media and Western media is biased , writing " mainstream media , wherever it may be based , is widely acknowledged to be overly deferential to political and economic power and that means , as consumers of news .

In previous years , countries that received a top 10 placing were automatically granted a spot in the next year 's final without having to compete in a semi-final , but for 2008 , the EBU changed the automatic qualification regulations so that all countries except the " Big 4 " ( France , Germany , Spain , and the United Kingdom ) and host country , would have to pass through one of two semi-finals . The EBU split up countries with a friendly voting history into separate semi-finals , to give a better chance for other countries to win . Greece and Cyprus had often been accused of favoring each other , with each awarding the other the maximum number of points ( twelve ) at the previous contest . On January 28 , 2008 , the EBU held a special draw which determined that Greece would be in '' Semi-final 1 '' held on May 20 , 2008 in Belgrade , Serbia ; Cyprus was subsequently placed in the second semi-final

It was also the UK 's strongest showing since winning the 1981 Contest with " Making Your Mind Up . " The song was a contemporary ballad about a man and a woman who are both too afraid to plunge head-first with their emotions into a love affair ; while both of them want to be loved by the other , both of them are letting their heads rule their hearts . In the chorus , Vikki sings that " love is " the product of a number of impulsive decisions , such as " taking a chance on two hearts beating as one . " Vikki nominally used a single chair as a prop , first sitting in it while singing the song , then circling it and abandoning it entirely by the second half of the song

The events at Altamont Free Concert shocked many Americans , including those who had strongly identified with hippie culture .

Nevertheless , the turbulent political atmosphere that featured the bombing of Cambodia and shootings by National Guardsmen at Jackson State University and Kent State University still brought people together . These shootings inspired the May 1970 song by Quicksilver Messenger Service " What About Me ? " , where they sang , " You keep adding to my numbers as you shoot my people down " , as well as Neil Young 's " Ohio " , a song that protested the Kent State massacre , recorded by Crosby , Stills , Nash and Young

		CONTEXT=Music critics favorably reviewed " Never Catch Me " . Named Best New Track by '' Pitchfork Media '' , editor Jayson Greene praised Lamar 's performance , writing " his hyper-vaulting flow and embedded rhyme patterns within rhyme patterns " . For its year-end list of " The 100 Best Tracks of 2014 " , '' Pitchfork '' ranked the song at number 23 . Also commenting on Lamar , '' Billboard '' 's Chris Payne wrote , " There are n't many A-list rappers who could handle a beat like this , but Kendrick is clearly one of them . " '' Rolling Stone '' editor Jon Dolan gave the song three-and-a-half out of five stars , commenting " Over offhandedly lovely , warp-speed psychedelic soul-jazz , Lamar unleashes a word-mad waterfall with a worried emotional core ( " analyze my demise I say I 'm super-anxious " , he raps ) . " '' Consequence of Sound '' editor Nina Corcoran wrote : " when combined with one of Lamar ’s hottest verses to date ( before '' To Pimp a Butterfly '' ) , the song explodes . But it does n’t stop there . FlyLo shows off his talent by shifting gears post-Kendrick verse the only way you can : insane keys , double-time bass drum , and unrelenting hand claps . Eventually , it ’s all swallowed up in massive swelling synth and choral hums , fading to a beautiful , passionate outro . " Directed by Hiro Murai , the video begins at a funeral ( including attendees Flying Lotus and Thundercat in cameo roles ) . Seemingly a sad video , it turns instantly joyful when the two late children - a boy and a girl - bound out of their caskets at the front of the church and dance gleefully down the aisle . The mourners ca n't see the children as they dance right out of the church and out onto a blacktop , but a group of other kids chases after them as they hop in a hearse and drive away . The clip was featured by several publications on their year-end list of best videos , including '' Pitchfork '' , '' Spin '' , and Stereogumwith the latter listing it at number one . The video received two nominations at the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards : Best Choreography and Best Cinematography , ultimately winning the latter

		CONTEXT=Crispi was replaced as prime minister by Antonio Di Rudinì in February 1891 , who was succeeded by Giovanni Giolitti in May 1892 . On January 20 , 1893 , when peasants of Caltavuturo occupied communal land that they claimed was theirs , local authorities killed 13 and wounded 21 in the Caltavuturo massacre . Disturbances continued throughout the year . The Fasci started out as urban movements , animated by artisans , which evolved into a more popular and combative mass movement with the adherence of sulphur miners , and in a later stage with the involvement of peasants and sharecroppers . In the autumn of 1893 , labour conflicts in the cities and the mines came together with the protests and claims of the farmers . The movement reached its greatest breadth in the manifestations against taxes , involving the lowest tiers of the city and the countryside , becoming difficult , if not impossible , to control by its leaders

		CONTEXT=The Generation of the '30s ( ) was a group of Greek writers , poets , artists , intellectuals , critics , and scholars who made their debut in the 1930s and introduced modernism in Greek art and literature . The Generation of the '30s is also cited as a social movement . The previous Medieval and post-Byzantine Greek eras , which glorified religion , Jesus , and the certainty of Enlightenment thinking , were rejected by modernism . Elements of surrealism and utopianism were introduced in efforts to renew contemporary literature . Most notable among the Generation of the ‘ 30s is Giorgos Seferis , a Greek poet of the 20th century who instigated the turning point into modernity with surrealism in his poetry . After the Balkan Wars and the disastrous Greco - Turkish War of 1922 , literature could no longer boast nationalistic aspirations of the previous generation . Thus , there was a need to establish a new dogma , or Greekness ( ) , that would aestheticize Hellenocentric opinions , attitudes , and symbols , and foster a new national identity . The Generation of the ‘ 30s enacted this by publishing various art and literature that were autonomous from other foreign models , and institutionalized modern literature to open up new perspectives and explore new ways to understand Greekness .

		GOLD_MENTION=first Republican National Convention
		CONTEXT=The first official Republican convention in Illinois was held on May 29 , 1856 , in Bloomington . Chairman John M. Palmer was elected convention president after his opening address . Nine vice presidents and five secretaries were then elected . The convention nominated Bissell for governor with Francis Hoffmann as lieutenant governor , Ozias M. Hatch for secretary of state , Jesse K. Dubois as auditor , and James Miller as treasurer . Hoffmann was found to be ineligible for his position due to a residency requirement , and John Wood was nominated in his place . The following resolutions defining the party platform were approved : Resolved , That foregoing all former differences of opinions upon other questions , we pledge ourselves to unite in opposition to the present administration and to the party which upholds and supports it and to use all honorable and constitutional means to wrest the Government from the unworthy hands which now control it and to bring it back in its administration to the principles and practices of Washington , Jefferson and their great and good compatriots of the Revolution . Resolved , That foregoing all former differences of opinions upon other questions , we pledge ourselves to unite in opposition to the present administration of the Government ; that under the Constitution Congress possesses the power to prohibit slavery in the Territories ; and that , whilst we will maintain all constitutional rights of the South , we also hold that justice , humanity , the principles of freedom as expressed in our Declaration of Independence and our national constitution , and the purity and perpetuity of our Government require that that power shall be exerted to prevent the extension of slavery into territory heretofore free . Resolved , That the repeal of the Missouri Compromise was unwise and injurious ; an open and aggravated violation of the plighted faith of the States , and that the attempt of the present administration to force slavery into Kansas against the known wishes of the legal voters of that Territory is an arbitrary and tyrannous violation of the rights of the people to govern themselves , and that we will strive by all constitutional means to secure to Kansas and Nebraska the legal guaranty against slavery of which they were deprived at the cost of the violation of the plighted faith of the nation . Resolved , That we are devoted to the Union and will , to the last extremity , defend it against the efforts now being made by the dis-unionists of this administration to compass its dissolution , and that we will support the Constitution of the United States , in all its provisions regarding it , as the sacred bond of our Union and the only safeguard for the preservation of the rights of ourselves and our posterity . Resolved , That we are in favor of the immediate admission of Kansas as a member of this Confederacy under the constitution adopted by the people of said Territory . Resolved , That the spirit of our institutions as well as the Constitution of our country , guarantees the liberty of conscience as well as political freedom , and that we will proscribe no one by legislation or otherwise on account of religious opinions , or in consequence of place of birth . Lincoln delivered the closing address . The speech was purportedly so captivating that no reporter made a record of it . The address has become known as Lincoln 's Lost Speech . The delegates to the convention were : The Democrats had nominated Richardson for governor at their convention earlier that month . The remnants of the Whig party declined to run a candidate . The first Republican National Convention met that June , nominating John C. Fremont for president . Fremont was defeated handily in his bid for president , including in Illinois , but the Republican state ticket in Illinois was successful . Bissell became the first Governor from a party other than the Democrats since 1838 . Republicans would win every subsequent gubernatorial election through 1893

		CONTEXT=The 1860 Republican National Convention nominated Lincoln , a moderate former Congressman from Illinois , as its standard-bearer . The Republican Party platform promised not to interfere with slavery in the states , but opposed the further extension of slavery into the territories . The first 1860 Democratic National Convention adjourned without agreeing on a nominee , but a second convention nominated Senator Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois for president . Douglas 's support for the concept of popular sovereignty , which called for each individual territory to decide on the status of slavery , alienated many Southern Democrats . The Southern Democrats , with the support of President Buchanan , held their own convention and nominated Vice President John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky for president .

		COREF_ID=881739
		ANSWER=NA_RETRIEVER
		GOLD_MENTION=Republican Presidential nomination
		CONTEXT=While the early scenes of Lincoln 's life are remarkably accurate , much of the later scenes contain historical inaccuracies . The famous Lincoln-Douglas debates , in addition to the historically accurate topic of the extension of slavery , have been turned into an argument about secession . Lincoln was famously an underdog for the Republican Presidential nomination in 1860 ; in the film it is suggested he is the sole nominee as a result of the Lincoln-Douglas debates . The outbreak of the Civil War seems to be the Union firing on Charleston , South Carolina from Fort Sumter , rather than the other way around . Also , early in hostilities , General Winfield Scott is depicted as being overconfident of a quick victory ( and something of a buffoon ) , when in reality he was one of the voices in the minority claiming the war would be long , costly , and bloody . Lincoln receives a report from the Secret Service that some copperheads in the North have issued threats against him . The Secret Service was not created until two months after Lincoln 's death . Finally , in the climax of the film , Lincoln delivers a conflation of famous words from the Gettysburg Address and Second Inaugural Address at Ford 's Theatre on April 14 , 1865 – just moments before being assassinated . This was Griffith 's second portrayal of Lincoln 's assassination , the first being in '' The Birth of a Nation ''

		CONTEXT=The Georgia Platform was a statement executed by a Georgia Convention in Milledgeville , Georgia on December 10 , 1850 , in response to the Compromise of 1850 . Supported by Unionists , the document affirmed the acceptance of the Compromise as a final resolution of the sectional slavery issues while declaring that no further assaults on Southern rights by the North would be acceptable . The Platform had political significance throughout the South . In the short term it was an effective antidote to secession , but in the long run it contributed to sectional solidarity and the demise of the Second Party System in the South . Much of the document was written by Charles J. Jenkins , a Whig lawyer and state legislator from Augusta .

		CONTEXT=The Georgia Platform was a statement executed by a Georgia Convention in Milledgeville , Georgia on December 10 , 1850 , in response to the Compromise of 1850 . Supported by Unionists , the document affirmed the acceptance of the Compromise as a final resolution of the sectional slavery issues while declaring that no further assaults on Southern rights by the North would be acceptable . The Platform had political significance throughout the South . In the short term it was an effective antidote to secession , but in the long run it contributed to sectional solidarity and the demise of the Second Party System in the South . Much of the document was written by Charles J. Jenkins , a Whig lawyer and state legislator from Augusta .

		CONTEXT=By the time the 1920 Republican National Convention began in June , a Senate sub-committee had tallied the monies spent by the various candidates , with totals as follows : Wood $ 1.8 million ; Lowden $ 414,000 ; Johnson $ 194,000 ; and Harding $ 114,000 ; the committed delegate count at the opening gavel was : Wood124 ; Johnson112 ; Lowden72 ; Harding39 . Still , at the opening , less than one-half of the delegates were committed , and many expected the convention to nominate a compromise candidate like Pennsylvania Senator Philander C. Knox , Massachusetts Senator Henry Cabot Lodge , or 1916 nominee Charles Evans Hughes . No candidate was able to corral a majority after nine ballots . After the convention adjourned for the day , Republican Senators and other leaders , who were divided and without a singular political boss , met in Room 404 of the Blackstone Hotel in Chicago . After a nightlong session , these party leaders tentatively concluded Harding was the best possible compromise candidate ; this meeting has often been described as having taken place in a " smoke-filled room . " The next day , on the tenth ballot , Harding was nominated for president . Delegates then selected Massachusetts governor Calvin Coolidge to be his vice-presidential running mate

		CONTEXT=Hayes had pledged himself to a one-term presidency , and the Republican nomination in 1880 attracted many candidates , including Sherman . Hayes 's preference was for Sherman to succeed him , but he made no official endorsement , and he did not think Sherman could win the nomination . Among the early favorites for the nomination were former President Grant , Senator James G. Blaine of Maine , and Senator George F. Edmunds of Vermont . Grant did not actively promote his candidacy , but his entry into the race energized his partisans , and when the convention met in Chicago in June 1880 , they instantly divided the delegates into Grant and anti-Grant factions , with Blaine the most popular choice of the latter group . After Grant and Blaine had been nominated , James Garfield nominated Sherman with an eloquent speech , saying " You ask for his monuments , I point you to twenty-five years of national statutes . Not one great beneficent statute has been placed in our statute books without his intelligent and powerful aid . " The speech , while heartfelt , was not particularly stirring . As Senator George Frisbie Hoar later explained , " t here was nothing stimulant or romantic in the plain wisdom of John Sherman "

In one incident in the 2010 preseason he was removed from training and verbally reprimanded by club leadership when he was deemed unfit to train after a big night out . Despite these struggles , his on-field development was such that he would still debut in the 2010 season 's opening match , a 56-point Richmond loss against at the MCG . Martin recorded the sixth most disposals of any Tiger ( 18 ) to go along with four marks , three tackles and three clearances . Two weeks later Martin was convicted by the AFL tribunal for a high hit on Sydney 's Josh Kennedy in round 3 . He did not receive a suspension for the incident however , returning to football the following week . After four matches Martin ranked fourth in the league for clearances and eighth for hard-ball gets . Media reports emerged after round 8 that the 18 year old Martin had received a significant contract offer from expansion club the Greater Western Sydney Giants . The offer , which the Herald Sun ’s Mark Robinson claimed to be worth $ 2.4 million over three seasons , would have taken effect in the new club 's first AFL season in 2012 . Martin later said he had never entertained the idea of moving to the start-up club . In round 10 he had gained attention for his on-field efforts again , this time being nominated for the 2010 AFL Rising Star award after a 21 disposal and 11 clearance match against Port Adelaide . Due to his previous tribunal conviction however , Martin was ruled ineligible for the award and thus did not officially place in the end of season award 's points tally . He drew the attention of Sydney coach Paul Roos by round 14 , prompting Roos to send veteran Brett Kirk onto Martin in a tagging role . Despite this extra attention , he still managed to record 18 disposals and a goal in the match at the MCG . After 17 rounds Martin ranked second at the club for clearances and inside 50s as well as third for disposals and contested possessions . At the same time he ranked first among that season 's Rising Star nominees in clearances , contested possessions and inside 50s .

At season 's end he reiterated his commitment to the club ( and rejection of the former GWS overtures ) by signing a two-year contract extension that would keep him at Richmond until the end of the 2013 season .

		CONTEXT=He arrived at the club as an incredibly shy and underdeveloped personality , a fact that was noted by teammate Trent Cotchin who said though Martin was 18 “ he seemed much younger in some of the ways he behaved . ” Indeed , he struggled initially to adjust to the expectations of professional football . In one incident in the 2010 preseason he was removed from training and verbally reprimanded by club leadership when he was deemed unfit to train after a big night out . Despite these struggles , his on-field development was such that he would still debut in the 2010 season 's opening match , a 56-point Richmond loss against at the MCG . Martin recorded the sixth most disposals of any Tiger ( 18 ) to go along with four marks , three tackles and three clearances . Two weeks later Martin was convicted by the AFL tribunal for a high hit on Sydney 's Josh Kennedy in round 3 . He did not receive a suspension for the incident however , returning to football the following week . After four matches Martin ranked fourth in the league for clearances and eighth for hard-ball gets . Media reports emerged after round 8 that the 18 year old Martin had received a significant contract offer from expansion club the Greater Western Sydney Giants . The offer , which the Herald Sun ’s Mark Robinson claimed to be worth $ 2.4 million over three seasons , would have taken effect in the new club 's first AFL season in 2012 . Martin later said he had never entertained the idea of moving to the start-up club . In round 10 he had gained attention for his on-field efforts again , this time being nominated for the 2010 AFL Rising Star award after a 21 disposal and 11 clearance match against Port Adelaide . Due to his previous tribunal conviction however , Martin was ruled ineligible for the award and thus did not officially place in the end of season award 's points tally . He drew the attention of Sydney coach Paul Roos by round 14 , prompting Roos to send veteran Brett Kirk onto Martin in a tagging role . Despite this extra attention , he still managed to record 18 disposals and a goal in the match at the MCG . After 17 rounds Martin ranked second at the club for clearances and inside 50s as well as third for disposals and contested possessions . At the same time he ranked first among that season 's Rising Star nominees in clearances , contested possessions and inside 50s . He was also fourth for average disposals and fifth for average tackles . In round 19 he was rested by the club before returning to play out the final five matches of the season . He missed just that one game in his debut season and finished the year ranked second at Richmond for clearances and inside 50s , as well as third for both contested possessions and disposals . In addition to winning the Fred Swift Medal for fourth place at the club 's best and fairest night , Martin also received six votes in the Brownlow Medal count that year , the most by any Richmond debutant since Craig Lambert in 1988 . At season 's end he reiterated his commitment to the club ( and rejection of the former GWS overtures ) by signing a two-year contract extension that would keep him at Richmond until the end of the 2013 season . The extension was reported by the Herald Sun to be in the vicinity of $ 400,000-a-year

		CONTEXT=The Japanese invasion of Taiwan ( ) ( May – October 1895 ) was a conflict between the Empire of Japan and the armed forces of the short - lived Republic of Formosa following the Qing Dynasty 's cession of Taiwan to Japan in April 1895 at the end of the First Sino - Japanese War . The Japanese sought to take control of their new possession , while the Republican forces fought to resist Japanese occupation . The Japanese landed near Keelung on the northern coast of Taiwan on 29 May 1895 , and in a five - month campaign swept southwards to Tainan . Although their advance was slowed by guerrilla activity , the Japanese defeated the Formosan forces ( a mixture of regular Chinese units and local Hakka militias ) whenever they attempted to make a stand . The Japanese victory at Baguashan on 27 August , the largest battle ever fought on Taiwanese soil , doomed the Formosan resistance to an early defeat . The fall of Tainan on 21 October ended organised resistance to Japanese occupation , and inaugurated five decades of Japanese rule in Taiwan .

		CONTEXT=The discovery of LFEs originates in Japan at the Nankai trough and is in part due to the nationwide collaboration of seismological research following the Kobe earthquake of 1995 . Low frequency earthquakes in Japan were first observed in a subduction setting where the Philippine Sea plate subducts at the Nankai trough near Shikoku . The low-frequency continuous tremor researchers observed was initially interpreted to be a result of dehydration reactions in the subducting plate . The source of these tremors occurred at an average depth of around 30 kilometers , and they were distributed along the strike of the subduction interface over a length of 600 kilometers . Similar to Cascadia , these low frequency tremors occurred with slow slip events that had a recurrence interval of approximately 6 months . The later discovery of LFEs forming tremor confirmed the widespread existence of LFEs at Japanese subduction zones , and LFEs are widely observed and believed to occur as a result of SSEs

		CONTEXT=The Ryukyu Kingdom was a kingdom in the Ryukyu Islands from 1429 to 1879 . It was ruled as a tributary state of imperial China by the Ryukyuan monarchy , who unified Okinawa Island to end the Sanzan period , and extended the kingdom to the Amami Islands and Sakishima Islands . The Ryukyu Kingdom played a central role in the maritime trade networks of medieval East Asia and Southeast Asia despite its small size . The Ryukyu Kingdom became a vassal state of the Satsuma Domain of Japan after the invasion of Ryukyu in 1609 but retained de jure independence until it was transformed into the Ryukyu Domain by the Empire of Japan in 1872 . The Ryukyu Kingdom was formally annexed and dissolved by Japan in 1879 to form Okinawa Prefecture , and the Ryukyuan monarchy was integrated into the new Japanese nobility .

		CONTEXT=Tukhachevsky fervently criticised the Red Army ’s performance during the 1926 Summer manoeuvres . He criticised the officer ’s inability to determine what course of action to take and communicate that with their troops especially harshly . Tukhachevsky noted that initiative among officers was lacking , that they responded slow to changes in the situation and that communication was poor . This was not purely the officer ’s fault as the only way of communication from local unit headquarters to the field positions was a single telephone line . In contrast German divisions mobilised shortly after during the interwar period had telephones , radio , horse , cycle and motorcycle messengers , signal lights and flags and pieces of cloth with which messages were to be conveyed mostly to aircraft . Tukhachevsky reached the position of 1st deputy commissar for defence to commissar for defence Voroshilov . Voroshilov disliked Tukhachevsky and would later be one of the initiators of the great purge which would n’t benefit Tukhachevsky ’s safety . According to Zhukov it was Tukhachevsky and not Voroshilov who ran the ministry in practice . While Voroshilov disliked Tukhachevsky his perception of military doctrine was nonetheless impacted significantly by Tukhachevsky ’s ideas

		CONTEXT=When the war broke out , the Bosnia and Herzegovina TO was mobilised , but the JNA refused to return its weaponry , which it had confiscated in 1990 . Bosniaks and Bosnian Croats had already left the JNA . The priority for the JNA was the security of its bases , as this had proven to be a vulnerability during the Battle of the Barracks in Croatian War of Independence . At the beginning of April , a number of towns in north-eastern Bosnia fell in quick succession to a combination of JNA , Serb volunteer and Bosnian Serb forces . These included Bijeljina , Zvornik , Višegrad , and Foča . The capture of each town was followed up by massacres and ethnic cleansing of the towns ' Bosniak inhabitants . On 15 April , Bosnian MUP and TO seized the arms , ammunition and equipment of the Tuzla Regional TO in the towns of Srebrenik , Lukavac and in Tuzla itself . By the end of the month , the Bosnian Government had re-organised the Bosnia and Herzegovina TO , incorporating the troops of the Patriotic League . In total , the new force had around 100,000 men , but only about 40,000 – 50,000 small arms and virtually no heavy weapons

It portrays the career of Benedict Arnold in the American Revolutionary War and his dramatic switch in 1780 from fighting for American Independence to being a Loyalist trying to preserve British rule in America . Arnold 's relationships with his wife Peggy Shippen and the British officer John André are focused on . The friction between Arnold and General Horatio Gates , portrayed near the beginning of the film ( for example , in one scene when Arnold derisively refers to him as " Granny Gates " ) , was historically accurate . The movie points out that , before his treason , Arnold was considered a patriot and a hero . A letter from General Washington is read at the beginning where he enthusiastically recommends Arnold for promotion saying that there is no general in the army more deserving and even comparing him to Hannibal . The movie briefly documents Arnold 's final years of exile in England in which he laments his treasonous acts , realizing that he is despised and that people compare him with Judas and Lucifer .

		CONTEXT=" Player preferences among new and old violins " is a scholarly paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in January 2012 . It describes a double - blind study in which researcher Claudia Fritz of the Pierre and Marie Curie University and violinmaker Joseph Curtin asked judges and participants at the 2010 International Violin Competition of Indianapolis to choose the violin they preferred from a pool of three modern violins , two Stradivariuses , and one Guarneri ' del Gesu ' . Fritz and Curtin found that participants most frequently chose a new rather than old violin . This result — which contradicts widespread belief among violinists that the best 16th and 17th century Golden Age violins are superior to the best modern ones — attracted significant media attention .

The storms brought warmer 50 °F ( 10 °C ) weather that was a cause of one stage of flooding and the continuous rains a second cause of flooding . The natural run-off of 1 to 3 inches ( 2.5 to 7.5 cm ) was far surpassed by the deluge of from 10 to 30 inches ( 25 to 75 cm ) of water in the region . The flood came before pending flood control legislation was enacted or any significant flood control measures implemented . The narrowness of the valleys and encroachment of buildings on the river banks contributed to record flooding . By the time nightfall came one-third of the city was under of water and by the time flooding was over twenty-five people lost their lives . The damages , estimated at $ 43 million , made it the worst flood since the flood of 1889 and the event is chronicled at the Johnstown Flood Museum After the flood , sweeping nationwide flood control laws were enacted and from 1938 to 1943 Johnstown saw many projects completed .

		CONTEXT=The region had already experienced several large earthquakes , the very large 1855 Wairarapa Earthquake , and the 1934 Pahiatua earthquake in the Northern Wairarapa . The 1855 earthquake occurred on the Wairarapa Fault which is part of the North Island Fault System . At 11.16 pm a small and sharp but brief earthquake of magnitude 7.2 Ms ( Mw 6.9-7.2 ) shook a wide area in the lower North Island from Eketahuna to Masterton , Featherston and Wellington ; and was noticed from Auckland to near Dunedin . The main earthquake was of 7.2 Ms and the epicentre was near Masterton and 12 km deep . The quake lasted for over a minute and had been preceded by a foreshock three hours earlier at 8.15 pm . Many buildings in Masterton were damaged . The mayor Thomas Jordan declared a state of emergency and got troops to patrol the town . There was considerable damage in Palmerston North . In Wellington twenty thousand chimneys fell , and there was one death in the suburb of Kelburn when a 70-year old retired chemist Hedley Victor Evens ( sic ) was killed by coal gas from a fractured pipe . Some downtown pediments were damaged , but some had already been removed after the 1931 Hawke 's Bay earthquake . The city engineer K. E . Luke held that damage was less severe as the quake ended swiftly . Another shock in the area struck on 2nd August at 12.34 am , preceded by a foreshock on the late afternoon of the 1st . This was of magnitude 7.0 Ms ( Mw 6.8 ) or slightly less than the earlier quake . The epicentre was 40 km deep and at location 41.01 ° S and 175.52 ° E. Wairarapa except for Eketahuna did not suffer as badly , though in Masterton the June damage was exacerbated . The 2 August aftershock was followed by a third severe aftershock on 2 December , with about 600 aftershocks recorded to the end of the year . Repairs from the first quake were not completed , and the mortar for some repairs had not properly set . Some buildings weakened in June suffered further damage , though it was sometimes hard to tell if further damage had occurred . In Masterton many buildings were badly damaged by the first quake ; the fire station , the Bank of New Zealand , several shops and St Matthews Church ( which was later blown up by the Army ) . The Waiohine road bridge was badly sunken and was closed . After the second quake the Wairarapa Farmers Co-op building partly collapsed . In Wellington the first quake toppled some twenty thousand chimneys . In August there was serious damage in the Willis Street – Manners Street area to three buildings : Charles Begg 's music shop , the Duke of Edinburgh Hotel , and the Regent Hotel

		CONTEXT=The region was affected by the Great Fire of 1922 , considered one of the worst disasters ever to befall the area . Haileybury suffered the worst damage , and approximately ninety percent of the town was destroyed , leaving only Millionaire 's Row and a few other neighborhoods intact . The mass destruction is partially attributable to strong wind on the day of the fire . Approximately 3500 people were left homeless by the fire . The Toronto Transit Commission ( TTC ) , with many retired street cars in its yards , sent many old car bodies to serve as houses during the reconstruction . Some of these cars remained for years , and one has recently been restored and is in the museum at Haileybury . As well , the area was affected by the 1935 Timiskaming earthquake , which had its epicentre at Lac Kipawa in Quebec , approximately halfway between the Haileybury/New Liskeard area and North Bay

		GOLD_MENTION=shooting at Fort Hood military base
		CONTEXT=In November 2009 , the Five-seven again became subject to controversy in the United States , following the shooting at Fort Hood military base , in Texas . A U.S. Army psychiatrist , Major Nidal Malik Hasan , opened fire on fellow soldiers with a Five-seven pistol , killing 13 people and wounding 29 in the worst shooting ever to take place on an American military base . Shortly after the shooting , FNH USA responded with a fact sheet dismissing allegations about the nature of the pistol , stating that it is only offered to civilians with sporting ammunition . Later in the month , a number of gun control organizations such as the Brady Campaign wrote a collaborative letter to U.S. President Barack Obama , citing the weapon 's use by the Fort Hood shooter and Mexican drug cartels , and calling on him to ban importation of the Five-seven pistol and 5.7 × 28 mm ammunition . In July 2010 , legislation was introduced in the United States Congress by Rep. Engel , for a third time , under the new designation '' H.R. 6030 : PLEA Act '' . Like its previous incarnations , the '' H.R. 6030 '' bill failed to proceed to a vote by either the House of Representatives or Senate

		GOLD_MENTION=2010 Times Square car bombing attempt
		CONTEXT=The overall ineffective and illegitimate result of the war on terror means that the costs have thus far outweighed the successes . Counter-terrorism efforts such as Targeted killing and drone strikes have backfired and are not proven to work , and have even perpetuated the number of terrorist attacks , including suicide bombings . While counter-terrorism may deter some attacks , it can not prevent all , and often has the result of provoking rather than reducing terrorism . The Iraq War was not productive in countering terrorism . Upward of 60 examples of terrorist incidents in America are proven consequences of United States foreign policy and military intervention . Still , no academic scholar in orthodox terrorism studies has considered American military intervention as the primary problem . It is noted that at Faisal Shahzad 's trial – following his failed 2010 Times Square car bombing attempt – he cited the drones that were killing the people of his community as the reason for his vengeance . Unmanned drone attacks in Afghanistan and Pakistan tend to target public places and gatherings , such as weddings and funerals , and are increasing the threat of terrorism . Violence emanates and results from counterinsurgency/terrorism . What America calls preventative war , the Middle East calls state terrorism

" A picture of al-Quso surfaced with a Yemeni journalist Arafat Mudabish , who interviewed him for a story . Mudabish reports that " he lives in an isolated mountain area where there is no Yemeni government presence . " He was also linked with the 2009 Christmas bombing over Detroit , as suspected bomber Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab visited him to discuss the plot and the workings of the bomb . Al-Quso was from the same tribe as radical U.S.-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki , who had an operational role in the attack . On December 7 , 2010 the United States Department of State designated al-Quso as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist under Executive Order 13224 which “ blocks all al-Quso ’s property interests subject to U.S. jurisdiction and prohibits U.S. persons from engaging in transactions for the benefit of al-Quso . ” “ He was also placed on the United Nations ( UN ) 1267 list of persons associated with al Qa’ida and the Taliban requiring all UN member states to implement an assets freeze , a travel ban , and an arms embargo against this individual . ” Fahd Mohammed Ahmed al-Quso was killed by a CIA drone 's missile in Yemen on May 6 , 2012 , as he exited a vehicle alongside another operative . U.S. officials confirmed his death , along with confirmation from an official statement by AQAP

		CONTEXT=The designated terror group known as the East Turkestan Islamic Movement ( ETIM ) , is a UK-based Pan-Islamic group operating in Xinjiang with similar ideals to Al-Qaeda , but with less technological capability .

Chinese HUMINT in Xinjiang is stunted by the Uyghurs ' unwillingness to cooperate with police , so state security forces find difficulty in anticipating and planning for terrorist attacks .

		CONTEXT=Released in Europe to acclaim in 1952 , '' Othello '' won the '' Grand Prix du Festival International du Film '' at the Cannes Film Festival under the Moroccan flag . Welles could not find the film a distributor in the United States for over three years , and even after its U.S. release it was largely ignored . The film was re-released to theaters in a 1992 restoration that screened out of competition at the 1992 Cannes Film Festival and was shown to acclaim in the United States . The film has a 93 % approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes , based on 32 reviews with an average rating of 7.9 / 10 . The website 's critical consensus states , " This ragged take on Othello may take liberties with the source material , but Orson Welles 's genius never fails to impress . " In 1992 , Beatrice Welles-Smith , daughter of Orson Welles , supervised the restoration of the film , which saw over $ 1 million spent on improving the picture quality , re-synching the audio , adding extra sound effects , and completely re-recording the music in stereo . Although the restoration was greeted with positive reviews upon its release , it subsequently came under attack for numerous technical flaws and alterations . Further alterations were made between the restoration 's theatrical release and its home media release , after complaints that the opening scene lacked the Gregorian chanting it had previously had , and another scene was missing entirely . This is the only version which has been available on VHS and DVD since the mid-1990s , since legal action by Beatrice Welles has blocked either version released by Orson Welles from being sold . This version runs to 91 minutes

" Turan wrote " One of the paradoxes of Sundance is that the quirkiness and charm around the edges of the festival are not always fully appreciated because so much of the media focus is on the premieres section and the U.S. dramatic competition " which he said " are , frankly , often the weakest parts of the festival . " Turan said " Sundance 's insistence on giving equal weight to documentaries and dramas has made it into as important a nonfiction showcase as any festival in the world ; witness the fact that four out of the five Oscar-nominated docs this year debuted at Sundance last January . " He also wrote that the foreign language film competition " is a strength at Sundance , and yet that field is given even less popular attention than the documentaries . " Peter Knegt wrote that this year 's festival " probably wo n't replicate last year 's Oscar record . " He said " Despite a huge surge in sales , this year 's Sundance slate looks like it might be the least Oscar-friendly in some time . " He noted that the U.S. Dramatic Grand Jury Prize winners have been nominated for Best Picture for two years ( referring to '' Precious '' and '' Winter 's Bone '' ) . Knegt speculated on films that might be nominated for the Oscars . Films he deemed " most likely to succeed " at being nominated included : '' Like Crazy '' for Best Picture , Michael Shannon of '' Take Shelter '' for Best Actor , Elizabeth Olsen of '' Martha Marcy May Marlene '' for Best Actress , Felicity Jones of '' Like Crazy '' for Best Actress , Jessica Chastain of '' Take Shelter '' for Best Supporting Actress , '' Project Nim '' for Best Documentary Feature , '' Page One '' for Best Documentary Feature , and '' The Interrupters '' for Best Documentary Feature . He wrote " It 's reasonable to feel assured that at least one of Sundance 's docs will end up an Oscar nominee , if not two , three or four . " Jada Yuan of '' New York '' magazine wrote " perhaps the biggest highlight of the festival is just how ripe it 's been for acquisitions , with nearly 30 films getting picked up , the most at any Sundance ever . " On " why everyone is suddenly so bullish on independent film " , Owen Gleiberman wrote that the " energy and optimism at Sundance this year was n't just hype . " He said the factors he thought were driving a new evolving vision of the indie film world included : " The deals have n’t gotten cheaper — they 've gotten smarter " , a belief that last year 's new festival director John Cooper and director of programming Trevor Groth " have re-energized the festival , heightening its quality and organizing the movies with a tempting new shape and vision " , video on demand gives distributors a safety net and more confidence , and the audiences for Sundance movies are not going away , saying " The Oscars ... have become a testament to the central place that Sundance movies now occupy . " Redford was happy about the success of the festival , with about 45 films being sold vs 14 in 2010 , an increase of about 220 % . Redford said studios are realizing " there are audiences " for indie films
