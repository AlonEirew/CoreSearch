		ANSWER=Nieuwmarkt riots
		GOLD_MENTION=
		CONTEXT=The Nieuwmarkt riots ( Dutch : Nieuwmarktrellen ) , also referred to as the Amsterdam metro riots , is a series of serious disturbances in the Nieuwmarkt neighbourhood of Amsterdam , Netherlands . On 24 March 1975 , which later became known as Blue Monday , and on 8 April 1975 , protests against the planned demolition of homes ended in confrontations with over a hundred municipal police supported by 500 military police . The homes were considered by residents and protesters to be in good condition , but had to make way for the construction of the East Line tunnel of the Amsterdam metro . This was needed because the construction of the 3.5 km tunnel was largely done by sinking large concrete caissons . As a result of the riots , the city council of Amsterdam decided to abandon further plans for additional metro lines .

It would only keep its structure , since the rest was an empty plot of land with no terraces and a grandstand damaged during the war . During the 1950s , the Mestalla was renovated , resulting in a stadium with a seating capacity of 45,500 spectators . It was severely damaged by the flood of October 1957 when the Turia River broke its banks . The stadium soon returned to operational use with some more improvements , such as the addition of artificial lighting , and was inaugurated during the 1959 Fallas festivities

		CONTEXT=The canyon was just one of the many areas along the Front Range that were devastated in the September 2013 flood . While not as intense as the 1976 flood , the storms that caused the flooding in 2013 still sent enough water down the canyon to wash out the highway in many places . The flood also damaged the US Bureau of Reclamation 's Dille Diversion Dam . The biggest infrastructure casualty , however , was the City of Loveland 's hydroelectric plant ( rebuilt after the 1976 flood ) ; the Idylwilde Reservoir was completely filled with silt and rocks , the Idylwilde Dam broke free of the bedrock , and the hydroelectric plant in the Viestenz-Smith Mountain Park was filled with water and silt . The dam was in the process of being relicensed with the FERC , but it was instead demolished , the dam material and contents of the reservoir being used as fill for highway repairs .

		ANSWER=smooth
		GOLD_MENTION=devastating floods
		CONTEXT=December 1861 and January 1862 brought about devastating floods that placed the future of the city in doubt . In order to resolve the situation , the city residents agreed that additional levee construction was necessary . However , the city was divided between camps that supported a relatively small grading of a few feet to raise the city just above the rivers ' cresting levels and those that supported a substantial grading to accommodate basements in city businesses . In the upcoming election of 1863 , the level at which the city should be raised became a primary factor ; a candidate that supported high-level grading won , and high-level grading renovation proceeded . Earth was removed from a dangerous bend nearby the confluence of the two rivers and used to raise city blocks in 1868 ; the city 's sidewalks , until construction was finally finished , were uneven because neighbors of raised city blocks often remained at the pre-construction level . After the filled regions beneath buildings had settled , new streets had to be paved . While planking had been used in the past , newly raised streets chose either the smooth ( though indurable ) Nicolson pavement or the easily dirtied ( though durable ) cobblestone pavement . Grading and paving processes were fully completed by 1873 , leaving the first floors of many buildings at the time as basements and leaving second floors as new main floors . Today , this system of 19th-century basements is known as the Sacramento Underground

		GOLD_MENTION=Republican National Convention
		CONTEXT=The organization 's leaders maintained that " some U.S. laws , such as the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 , which limits the amount of time a family can receive federal assistance , violate Articles 23 , 25 and 26 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights . Those articles guarantee , respectively , the right to work for a living wage under humane conditions ; the right to adequate food , housing , medical care and social security ; and the right to education . " Starting in June 1998 , KWRU led the New Freedom Bus Tour , which traveled across the country , gathering stories of human rights violations to present as a petition to the United Nations . " Under the banner ' Freedom from Unemployment , Hunger and Homelessness , ' the KWRU team collected additional evidence on the negative impact of welfare reform and held educational sessions teaching the poor about their economic rights . " ( A second such bus tour was organized by the PPEHRC in November – December 2002 , which traveled to 27 cities to record human rights violations . ) In the late 1990s , Honkala started another nonprofit , the Poor People 's Economic Human Rights Campaign , of which she became National Coordinator . The PPEHRC represents " a network of over 40 poor people 's organizations from across the U.S. " One commentator has written that the campaign " is the only national movement to come out of welfare reform that has been organized by poor people , and not their advocates . " This organization was formed in direct response to the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act ( PRWORA ) of 1996 ( also known as the Welfare Reform Act ) , signed into law by Democratic President Bill Clinton , which she and her allies claim hurts recipients of welfare . The organization 's mission statement reads , " The Poor People 's Economic Human Rights Campaign is committed to uniting the poor across color lines as the leadership base for a broad movement to abolish poverty . We work to accomplish this through advancing economic human rights as named in the universal declaration of human rights — such as the rights to food , housing , health , education , communication and a living wage job . " Part of the purpose of the organization is to make homelessness and the homeless visible , in order to force politicians to act . Honkala claims that the latter prefer that the homeless remain invisible , so they wo n't have to address the problem . In a speech , Honkala said : " That 's what the authorities are saying to you : ' Go hide ! Go be under a bridge , or ... hide under a bench , and we wo n't arrest you , we wo n't do anything to you , because you will be quiet ! ' " As Honkala declared , " When you have nothing , you still have your voice . " In October 1999 , PPEHRC organized a month-long March of the Americas , from Washington , DC , to the United Nations in New York . Participants in the march included low-income families from the US , Canada and Latin America . The group " marched 15 miles a day for 32 days , sleeping in tent cities , churches and community centers at night , and holding press conferences and protests in local communities . " In July 2000 , a PPEHRC march for the opening day of the Republican Party 's National Convention in Philadelphia drew 10,000 homeless and poor people from around the country . ( Of the several protest marches during that convention , this was the only one denied a permit by city authorities . ) In November 2000 , at the historic Riverside Church in Manhattan in New York City , the PPEHRC held a " Poor People 's World Summit to End Poverty , " consisting of several hundred activists from some 30 countries , to share " experiences and work to build an international movement for economic human rights drawing explicitly on international treaties . " On July 4 , 2003 , Philadelphia held a celebration for the opening of the National Constitution Center , a new facility housing the Liberty Bell . Poor and homeless families from the city held a peaceful protest to demand their economic rights . " As the demonstrators marched toward Constitution Center single-file , carrying their own mattresses and led by children , park rangers , federal guards , and city police formed lines to prevent the families from approaching . Singing ' We Shall Not Be Moved , ' the demonstrators locked arms and refused to leave the sidewalk . Protest leaders Honkala and Galen Tyler had prepared a ' Declaration of Economic Human Rights ' to present at the Center . As they moved toward the Center , police moved to stop them , threw them to the ground , handcuffed them , and placed them under arrest ... Honkala was charged with one first-degree felony and four other felony counts . Police officers claimed that Honkala had struck one of them in the chest . However , a video taken at the time clearly shows Honkala carrying a mattress and being struck by the officer ... all the charges were subsequently withdrawn by the District Attorney 's office . " In August 2004 , Honkala marched with the PPEHRC in New York City ( without a permit ) to protest President Bush and the Republican National Convention ( RNC ) and to publicly call for greater attention by the government to the needs of the poor and homeless

		ANSWER=criticising capitalism
		GOLD_MENTION=mass murder
		CONTEXT=In 1988 , the party made '' The Next Step '' into a bulletin for its supporters . Later that year , a monthly magazine called '' Living Marxism '' was set up for a wider readership . Despite its beginnings as a far-left outlet , the politics espoused by the magazine developed a pronounced libertarianism . In December 1990 , '' Living Marxism '' ran an article which argued that the corrosive effect of the collapse of both Stalinism and reformism on the working class meant that " for the time being at least , the working class has no political existence " . In 1997 , the point was put more forcefully : In today 's circumstances class politics can not be reinvented , rebuilt , reinvigorated or rescued . Why ? Because any dynamic political outlook needs to exist in an interaction with existing individual consciousness . And contemporary forms of consciousness in our atomised societies can not be used as the foundation for a more developed politics of solidarity . Between 1990 and 1997 , the party developed the view that more than capitalism itself the danger facing humanity was the absence of a force for social change ( in philosophical language , a " subject " of history ) and the culture of low expectations that suppressed it . Prefacing a 1996 '' Living Marxism '' manifesto , Mick Hume argued : Of course ... we could have produced a familiar list of left-wing slogans complaining about problems like unemployment , exploitation and poverty which continue to scar our society . But that would be to ignore the transformation which has taken place in the political climate ... . At different times , different issues matter most . Each era has thrown up its own great questions which define which side you are on ... . A t '' Living Marxism '' , we see our job today as doing much more than criticising capitalism . That is the easy bit . There is a more pressing need to criticise the fatalistic critics , to counter the doom-mongers and put a positive case for human action in pursuit of social liberation . ... D ealing with ... unconventional questions , and puncturing the anti-human prejudices which surround them , is the precondition for making political action possible in our time . In February 1997 , shortly after the party disbanded , '' Living Marxism '' re-branded as '' LM '' , possibly to further distance itself from its leftist origins . Articles in '' LM '' argued : This magazine ran at least two articles in which the authors argued that the mass murder carried out in Rwanda in 1994 should not be described as genocide . In December 1995 , '' LM '' carried a report from an aid worker in Rwanda which argued : The lesson I would draw from my visit is that we must reject the term ' genocide ' in Rwanda . It has been used inside and outside Rwanda to criminalise the majority of ordinary Rwandan people , to justify outside interference in the country 's affairs , and to lend legitimacy to a minority military government imposed on Rwanda by Western powers . '' LM '' continued to create controversy on a variety of issues , most notably on the British Independent Television News ( ITN ) coverage of the Balkan conflict in the 1990s . The controversy centred on '' LM '' featuring an article by Thomas Deichmann in which he alleged that the ITN coverage of a refugee detention centre in Trnopolje during the conflict gave the false impression that the Bosnian Muslims were being held against their will in Serbian concentration camps . The ensuing libel award and costs arising from legal action by the ITN against '' LM '' were estimated to total around £ 1 million . The action bankrupted the magazine and its publishers

		GOLD_MENTION=Republican National Convention
		CONTEXT=Prior to the 1912 United States presidential election , Wheeler publicly debated the former California governor James N. Gillett on the question of which Republican nominee deserved the backing of his party , to be decided at the primary elections . Wheeler spoke for Theodore Roosevelt while Gillett argued for incumbent William Howard Taft . Wheeler said Taft was " blind to the signs of the times " , the candidate of " men satisfied with the old political methods . " In the event , Taft won the primary but Roosevelt ran anyway as a third party candidate , splitting the Republican vote to allow Woodrow Wilson to gain the presidency . In 1920 , Wheeler traveled to Chicago to serve as alternate delegate for California at the Republican National Convention . The California delegation put Wheeler on the podium to give a rousing speech for the nomination of California-born candidate Hiram Johnson who had been Roosevelt 's running mate in 1912

		ANSWER=criticising capitalism
		GOLD_MENTION=mass murder
		CONTEXT=In 1988 , the party made '' The Next Step '' into a bulletin for its supporters . Later that year , a monthly magazine called '' Living Marxism '' was set up for a wider readership . Despite its beginnings as a far-left outlet , the politics espoused by the magazine developed a pronounced libertarianism . In December 1990 , '' Living Marxism '' ran an article which argued that the corrosive effect of the collapse of both Stalinism and reformism on the working class meant that " for the time being at least , the working class has no political existence " . In 1997 , the point was put more forcefully : In today 's circumstances class politics can not be reinvented , rebuilt , reinvigorated or rescued . Why ? Because any dynamic political outlook needs to exist in an interaction with existing individual consciousness . And contemporary forms of consciousness in our atomised societies can not be used as the foundation for a more developed politics of solidarity . Between 1990 and 1997 , the party developed the view that more than capitalism itself the danger facing humanity was the absence of a force for social change ( in philosophical language , a " subject " of history ) and the culture of low expectations that suppressed it . Prefacing a 1996 '' Living Marxism '' manifesto , Mick Hume argued : Of course ... we could have produced a familiar list of left-wing slogans complaining about problems like unemployment , exploitation and poverty which continue to scar our society . But that would be to ignore the transformation which has taken place in the political climate ... . At different times , different issues matter most . Each era has thrown up its own great questions which define which side you are on ... . A t '' Living Marxism '' , we see our job today as doing much more than criticising capitalism . That is the easy bit . There is a more pressing need to criticise the fatalistic critics , to counter the doom-mongers and put a positive case for human action in pursuit of social liberation . ... D ealing with ... unconventional questions , and puncturing the anti-human prejudices which surround them , is the precondition for making political action possible in our time . In February 1997 , shortly after the party disbanded , '' Living Marxism '' re-branded as '' LM '' , possibly to further distance itself from its leftist origins . Articles in '' LM '' argued : This magazine ran at least two articles in which the authors argued that the mass murder carried out in Rwanda in 1994 should not be described as genocide . In December 1995 , '' LM '' carried a report from an aid worker in Rwanda which argued : The lesson I would draw from my visit is that we must reject the term ' genocide ' in Rwanda . It has been used inside and outside Rwanda to criminalise the majority of ordinary Rwandan people , to justify outside interference in the country 's affairs , and to lend legitimacy to a minority military government imposed on Rwanda by Western powers . '' LM '' continued to create controversy on a variety of issues , most notably on the British Independent Television News ( ITN ) coverage of the Balkan conflict in the 1990s . The controversy centred on '' LM '' featuring an article by Thomas Deichmann in which he alleged that the ITN coverage of a refugee detention centre in Trnopolje during the conflict gave the false impression that the Bosnian Muslims were being held against their will in Serbian concentration camps . The ensuing libel award and costs arising from legal action by the ITN against '' LM '' were estimated to total around £ 1 million . The action bankrupted the magazine and its publishers

		CONTEXT=" Mainstream Science on Intelligence " was a public statement issued by a group of academic researchers in fields associated with intelligence testing . It was originally published in The Wall Street Journal on December 13 , 1994 , as a response to what the authors claimed were inaccurate and misleading reports made by the media regarding academic consensus on the results of intelligence research in the wake of the appearance of The Bell Curve by Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray earlier the same year . It was drafted by professor of educational psychology Linda Gottfredson , sent to 131 researchers , and signed by 52 university professors described as " experts in intelligence and allied fields " , including around one third of the editorial board of the journal Intelligence , in which it was subsequently reprinted in 1997 . According to a 1996 response by former American Psychological Association president Donald Campbell , more than four - fifths of the signatories were not measurement experts , and , contrary to the letter 's claims , " environmental differences between Blacks and Whites in opportunity to learn the vocabulary and other skills used in intelligence tests are adequate to explain Black - White differences in test scores , without any need for positing genetic differences .

After seeing the report , 15-year-old Marsha Albert of Silver Spring , Maryland , wrote a letter the following day to disc jockey Carroll James at radio station WWDC asking , " Why ca n't we have music like that here in America ? " On December 17 James had Miss Albert introduce " I Want to Hold Your Hand " live on the air .

James sent the record to other disc jockeys around the country sparking similar reaction . On December 26 , Capitol Records released the record three weeks ahead of schedule . The release of the record during a time when teenagers were on vacation helped spread Beatlemania in the US . On December 29 , '' The Baltimore Sun '' , reflecting the dismissive view of most adults , editorialized , " America had better take thought as to how it will deal with the invasion . Indeed a restrained ' Beatles go home ' might be just the thing . " In the next year alone , the Beatles would have 30 different listings on the Hot 100

In another interview , a month later , she revealed that she was working " very slowly , but progressively " on the album . In 2015 , she released the song " Pretty Girls " with Iggy Azalea , however the song was met with moderate impact and Spears headed back to the studio to record more songs , but did n't have plans to release a new album . In November 2015 , Spears teased on her Instagram account that she was working with songwriters Justin Tranter and Julia Michaels , by posting a picture of them looking " bemused " with the caption : " Working hard and hardly working ... new album ... wheeeee ! . " A month later , Tranter gave an interview for website NewNowNext about his work with Spears and commented : " Working with Britney is a fucking dream . She is so sweet , so inspiring and a master on the mic . Me and Julia had to leave the studio one day because our screams of excitement after every take she did were distracting the producers . " In late 2016 , during interviews to promote the album , Spears declared that she wanted to explore new things on the record , and that it was her " most hip-hop album , " explaining : " ... there are like two or three songs that go in the direction of more urban that I 've wanted to do for a long time now , and I just have n't really done that . " In May 2016 , in an exclusive interview for website '' Breathe Heavy '' , Tranter revealed : " Nobody ever talks about Britney as a writer and she ’s f " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " was written by Mattias Larsson , Robin Fredriksson , Julia Michaels , Justin Tranter and Sandy Chila , with production being done by Mattman & Robin . Mattman & Robin were also responsible for programming , drums , percussion , snaps , handclaps , synths , guitars , bass and kalimba , while Michaels and Jermaine Jackson provided background vocals . It was recorded at 158 Studios , Westlake Village , California , The Studio at the Palms , Las Vegas , Nevada , and at Wolf Cousins Studios , Stockholm , Sweden . " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is an electropop , and dance-pop song that lasts for three minutes and twenty-two seconds ( 3:22 ) . It features " subtle keyboards , a strummed guitar , " and " wobbly bass " in its instrumentation . For Brian Josephs of '' Spin '' , the song 's guitar slaps " recall her 2001 single ' I 'm a Slave 4 U. ' " Other critics also felt that the " strummed flamenco guitar " on the song is similar to those on Justin Timberlake 's " Like I Love You " . Bianca Gracie of '' Fuse '' opined that the song reminded her of " the glory days ( no pun intended ) of ' Circus ' and ' Femme Fatale ' . " Lyrically , " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is a flirty song about Spears " offer ing several reasons why her lover should come over and options , which can be seen in the lines " Nobody should be alone if they do n't have to be " and " I could get into that kissin ' and touchin ' / Or we could be good and do next to nothin ' . " Amy Roberts of '' Bustle '' noted that the lyrics are about hooking up , adding that they " celebrate the idea that casual relationships do n't need to be lacking respect or understanding . You do n't have to be in love with , or committing to , the person that you 're hooking up with , but that also does n't mean that you ca n't connect with them on a different level than just sex . In fact , Spears makes it clear that it 's kind of even cool if her hook-up does n't want to have sex . Her partner can draw the boundaries of where the massage she 's offering starts and ends , and if it remains as nothing more than a back rub then so be it – that 's totally cool . " For Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine , the song features " some dubious lyrics that seem to suggest masturbatory self-love " in the lines : " All I want is what you want/And all you want is me . " The chorus of the song features " a shouted gang " of backup singers , singing : " Whatever you want / whatever you need / I 'll do it ! . " Lewis Corner of Digital Spy called it " a thumping pop anthem , " praising " Britney 's seductive vocal delivery . " Gil Kaufman of '' Billboard '' named it a " fun , flirty " track . Bianca Gracie of '' Fuse '' described it as a " pulsating track that is a flirty booty call that is bound to own the dance floor . " Robbie Daw of Idolator found it to be " a traditional Spears-style chunk of dance-pop " and " arguably the best yet , with its thick whomping bass and that sparkling ' nobody should be alone if they do n't have to be ' breakdown . " Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine called it " impeccably produced downstairs music , " adding that it " is an irresistible slice of dance-pop , with an ebullient bassline and staccato acoustic guitar . " Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic declared that " some of the highlights on the album are the silliest songs , " citing " Do You Wan na Come Over " 's " overheated flamenco chorus " as an example . Maura Johnston of '' Boston Globe '' said the song was one of the album 's high points , noting that the song " is jolted to life by the slashed guitars that helped make ' Toxic ' a pop thrill . " John Murphy of musicOMH was positive while noting that the track " has a rush and urgency about it which marks it out as one of the album 's best songs . " Nolan Feeney of '' Entertainment Weekly '' also picked it as a highlight , praising the " acoustic guitars and gurgling bass lines that make for one freaky pop experiment . " Alex Macpherson of '' The Guardian '' wrote that the song " takes the party back to Britney 's heyday , " praising the inclusion of the flamenco guitar . For '' Los Angeles Times '' writer Mikael Wood , the song " restore s some of the sonic invention that once defined Spears ' biggest hits . " Nick Levine , writing for '' NME '' , echoed the same thought , writing : " The lusty strut of ‘ Do You Wan na Come Over ? ’ nods to her early-noughties Neptunes-produced hits . " In his Vice column , Robert Christgau selected " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " and " Clumsy " as his favorite tracks on the album . Amy Mackelden of '' Bustle '' elaborated about the track : With a strong '90s vibe , an upbeat tempo , and a surprising rhythm , " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " utilizes the best of Spears ' talents . ... " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " embraces the current trend for songs that are musically complicated , that layer up their beats and sound effects , and feature multiple voices and infectious shouting during their choruses . Much like Hailee Steinfeld and Gwen Stefani 's latest offerings , " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is melodic , has a fast tempo , and is instantly recognizable . And most importantly , it 's fun . On August 18 , 2016 , Spears added " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " , as well as " Make Me ... " , to the setlist of her Las Vegas residency show Britney : Piece of Me . Later , on September 1 , 2016 , a performance of the song was broadcast from Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas for Today . During the performance , she used " an outfit similar to her risqué costume from 2016 's VMAs , while her backup dancers stood out in brightly-colored tank tops and shorts , " as reported by '' Entertainment Weekly '' Ruth Kinane . The song was also included in Spears 's setlist for the iHeartRadio Music Festival on September 24 , 2016 . Spears also performed it at I Heart Radio Jingle Ball , Triple Show and B26 Pepsi Jingle Bash during December 2016 . Also performed it at Apple Music Festival which was held in United Kingdom

		CONTEXT=An episode of '' MTV Unplugged '' starring Cyrus premiered through MTV on January 29 , 2014 ; she performed an acoustic version of " Wrecking Ball " , among several additional tracks from '' Bangerz '' . On May 27 , 2014 Cyrus performed the song during the World Music Awards held in Monte Carlo , Monaco ; where she also won four World Music Awards . She wore a gown with a scenic theme based on flowers during the performance . It received positive reviews for its understated simplicity and strong vocal delivery . Cyrus returned to perform the song during the musical festival on June 21 , 2014 , Summertime Ball at Wembley Stadium of London , in front of 80,000 people . Cyrus has performed the song during her ongoing Bangerz Tour . A critic from the '' Nashville Scene '' praised the performance , writing , " Wrecking Ball was sung by Miley and earnestly shouted in unison by the arena , some of the audience tearing up . " Blake Hannon praised Cyrus ' vocal delivery , writing , " The crowd kept going when things slowed down for Wrecking Ball . It was the highlight of the night , and not because of anything visual . The costumed characters vanished and the screen was black , with Cyrus belting out one of the best pop power ballads in recent memory with only a smattering of lights . It 's a reminder that beneath it all , Cyrus has a voice — and a pretty big one , at that . " In September 2013 , British singer-songwriter James Arthur covered " Wrecking Ball " on Radio Hamburg in Germany . Later that month , The Gregory Brothers released a country version , which Laura Vitto from Mashable felt " trades in Miley 's pop-ballad sound for a twangier feel . " American singer-songwriter Alonzo Holt released his own rendition in October , which featured vocals from Arthur ; it peaked at number 97 on the UK Singles Chart and number 71 on the Irish Singles Chart . Upstate New York alternative metal band Cry To The Blind released a cover of " Wrecking Ball " on December 11 , 2013 . American group Haim covered " Wrecking Ball " during their performance on BBC Radio 1 's Live Lounge , while the trio London Grammar sang it for the same session in December . Rumer Willis later sang the track during a performance which Chiderah Monde from '' Daily News '' felt " captured more of the emotion behind the song " than Cyrus ' version . American singer Rebecca Black uploaded an acoustic version to her YouTube channel in November . Canadian singer Sarah Blackwood of Walk Off the Earth also released an acoustic version

		CONTEXT=Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny appears at his back door in his boxers and invites viewers for a look around his house ; including a ( now fully dressed ) encounter with his karaoke machine . He then sets off on his bicycle for an interview at RTÉ . Alas his attempts to get there unscathed come undone when his bike receives a puncture and he has to resort to queueing for a bus like the common person . When the bus arrives , he realises he has no money but after asking for some spare cash from an innocent bystander , he turns around to find the bus has pulled off again . In the RTÉ carpark , Pat Kenny sits in his car , casting his eyes over his fellow broadcasters and enviously longing to join them in their casual conversation . When he finally plucks up the courage to approach Marian Finucane and Joe Duffy , the latter is overheard insulting him and Pat heads back to his car . With Pat due on air in ten minutes , Tom decides to join him in the passenger seat but he must first overcome the clutches of George Hook , who once again attempts to lure him to Newstalk . Pat asks Tom what the world really thinks of him , believing that his assistant is the only person in the world who is loyal to him . Tom attempts to avoid the question , distracting Pat by ( wrongly ) telling him that Enda Kenny has just arrived . Eventually Tom opts to tell Pat , albeit with much hesitation , that he is '' " absolutely unbelievable " '' . At that moment Enda Kenny finally arrives at the studio , still in his biker gear and collapses with exhaustion on the steps having raced through Dublin to make the interview on schedule . Kenny and Kenny square off on air and , with Pat faced with an adversary so similar in perceived personality , popularity and name he is even more unable to cope with his feelings of unworthiness than usual . Pat breaks down live on air , mistaking Enda 's rival , Taoiseach Bertie Ahern , for his own rival , '' Liveline '' presenter Joe Duffy . This prompts Enda to join him in his moment of unrelenting emotion . The next morning Tom arrives at Pat 's house . Pat assumes he has come with his P45 or details of who is to take over the mantle of the station 's highest earning broadcaster . However Tom merely points to two giant sacks of complimentary mail he has carried on his bike from RTÉ headquarters . One of them even wants to sleep with the presenter , who quickly places the letter in the left front pocket of his dressing gown . Pat is astounded to discover he is all over the news and that celebrities such as 1992 Eurovision Song Contest winner Linda Martin , music mogul Louis Walsh and Boyzone lead singer Ronan Keating are talking about him . He hurries indoors to switch on his television . There he finds that figures from the worlds of sport and politics including Irish national football team manager Steve Staunton , Ireland rugby manager Eddie O'Sullivan and Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams are lining up in their droves to pay tribute to him . He is intrigued to find Fintan O'Toole has also spoken greatly of him but becomes irritated when he finds that Steve Staunton seems to have taken over the airwaves , typically reiterating how Pat has done a great job , how he works for the team , has delivered a great result and what else can you say . Meanwhile , Bertie Ahern repeatedly rings Tom 's mobile to request an interview with Pat , but on each occasion Tom tells him to ring back later . Pat and Tom stroll into RTÉ , where George Hook is astounded to hear of Pat 's newfound popularity . He is adamant that Tom will soon join him at Newstalk but Tom shows his unswaying loyalty by declaring he will go only where Pat goes . On Friday night George slips into RTÉ and just as an episode of '' The Late Late Show '' is coming to a close , approaches Pat 's dressing room . George is inadvertently knocked to the floor by a stray microphone where he lies moaning until Pat emerges from the dressing room . Pat steps over George and leaves RTÉ with Tom , telling his assistant that he should not allow anyone to undermine him before demanding that he open the door

Nina Braca from '' Billboard '' called it " triumphant " , while '' The Malay Mail '' said it was " humorous " , and Nolfi from '' Entertainment Weekly '' described it as " candy-colored " . Direct Lyrics ' Kevin Apaza wrote : " We totally dug this video . We liked the high budget , all the perfect details , the deep message conveyed , and of course Katy 's humor too " . Ross McNeilage from MTV UK similarly praised the video , pointing out its " high-concept " and stating : " The ... singer 's visual treatment brings the lyrics to life , highlighting its themes of resilience with a fitting storyline . Despite the serious undertones of defiance , the video is jam-packed with Katy 's goofy humour throughout and does n't take itself too seriously at all . " Evan Jorssen of NRJ likened the three women seen in the clip accompanying Perry to characters from the 1993 American comedy horror fantasy film '' Hocus Pocus '' and the 1899 French film '' Cinderella '' . Julien Goncalves of Pure Charts compared parts of the video 's concept to Madonna 's live performance of " Vogue " ( 1990 ) at the 1990 MTV Video Music Awards .

But all that is to be expected from an artist like Katy Perry , who is famous for her eccentricity .

		CONTEXT=At the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards , Beyoncé performed " Love on Top " after having said on the black carpet about an hour previous to going on stage that she would be making an announcement . Before beginning her live performance , she said to the audience : " Tonight I want you to stand up on your feet , I want you to feel the love that 's growing inside of me " , giving a hint about the news that she had alluded to on the black carpet . She took the stage in " a purple spangly tuxedo jacket , black pants and white tuxedo shirt , still rocking her fierce six-inch heels of old , pregnant or not " , as stated by Gil Kaufman of MTV News . As she performed , her blond hair blowing in the wind , and backed by six dancers wearing similar shimmering tuxes , Beyoncé gave new meaning to the lyrics : " Now everybody asks me why I 'm smiling out from ear to ear . " She kept her dancing to a minimum for most of the song as she held onto the microphone stand while singing " Love on Top " . Eventually making her way to the extended lip in front of the stage and throwing down , she encouraged the audience to put their hands together . Beyoncé ended the performance by dropping the microphone , opening her jacket , rubbing her belly , and thus announcing her pregnancy to the world

On 26 January 2006 , he survived an assassination attempt , when a roadside bomb detonated close to his convoy near the town of Balad , killing three of his bodyguards . Heading a parliamentary committee to assess the humanitarian situation in Nineveh Governorate , he criticized the conduct of governor Duraid Kashmoula : " We have seen no trace of the huge sums of money said to have been appropriated for the province and could gather no idea on how they were spent .

		GOLD_MENTION=2004 bombings of hotels
		CONTEXT=The Elmasry affair led to criticisms that the media focussed entirely on the comments of the CIC president while neglecting controversial comments made on the same program by a B'nai Brith official , Adam Aptowitzer , who stated that " When Israel uses terror ... to destroy a home and convince people ... to be terrified of what the possible consequences are , I 'd say that 's an acceptable use to terrify somebody . " The remarks only received attention several weeks after the broadcast , and after Elmasry 's apology and proffered resignation , when a press release by the Canadian Arab Federation highlighted them . Following the CAF press release , Aptowitzer retracted his comments and resigned his position with the B'nai Brith . '' Toronto Star '' city editor John Ferri told the '' Toronto Star '' 's ombud , Don Sellar , " we all had egg on our faces ... i t was embarrassing for every paper in the city not to get the whole story from the outset . " In a letter to the '' Toronto Star '' following Sellar 's column , Elmasary complained about the affair : Canadian news media - including the Star - launched a relentless and unfair attack against the Canadian Islamic Congress ( CIC ) and me while covering up for weeks the outrageous statements made on the same show by Adam Aptowitzer , then the Ontario chairman of the B'nai Brith Institute of International Affairs . While never referring to Aptowitzer 's statements , the media used news stories , editorials , op-ed pieces , columns , photos , front-page coverage , cartoons , and radio and television commentaries to paint a negative picture of CIC and myself which seriously distorts and falsifies the truth . It was widely reported , for example , that " Elmasry said all Israelis over 18 were legitimate targets for suicide bombers . " This is totally false . The media never questioned the completeness or the accuracy of the radio show transcript that was given to them . Instead , they totally and completely relied on the heavily selective one provided to them , which was one-sided and referred only to my remarks , but not to those by Aptowitzer . Elmasry also criticized Canadian Jewish groups over this incident . In an article entitled " When Jews Target a Canadian Muslim " , Elmasry accused the Canadian Jewish Congress ( CJC ) and Bnai Brith Canada of " putting pressure on my university to fire me " and that his words were " mis-represented to the public exactly as the CJC wished " . He also stated that " a Toronto Jewish businessman had threatened to withdraw his financial support for a chair of Jewish studies . " He also criticized the 2004 bombings of hotels in Taba , Egypt on the grounds that some of the victims there were not Israelis . These remarks prompted harshly-worded responses from representatives of the Canadian Jewish Congress and several prominent Canadian Muslims . At first , Elmasry defended his remarks by insisting that he was merely sharing the standard Palestinian point of view . This led to further charges from his critics , who accused him of using the Palestinians as a scapegoat . In a letter to the '' Toronto Star '' , he denied having said what he was reported to have said

		GOLD_MENTION=Mumbai 26/11 attack
		CONTEXT=Mithiborwala wrote that the Mumbai 26/11 attack was carried out by the CIA and Mossad , its objective being to establish a pro-US/Israeli consensus among Indians , allowing the US/Israeli political elite " to deploy our Military into the war theatre in Afghanistan . " In June 2011 Mithiborwala wrote that David Headley , who was involved with planning the 26/11 attack , was " a CIA-FBI operative whose task was to organize & expedite the Mumbai 26/11 terror attacks . " He wrote that the attacks were the result of a CIA/Saudi Arabian/Mossad conspiracy , saying " The strategic period & the timing of the terror attacks are a pointer to the powers behind the perpetrators . " Mithiborwala believes that Osama bin Laden has been dead since the latter half of December 2001 . He expressed his belief that the parties saying he was still alive were doing this because " The ghost of Bin Laden serves multiple purposes both at the Global and Indian context " , mainly to generate fear for the Hindu community and to be a " false hero " for Muslims , falsely inspiring youth to follow the " flawed path of extremism and terror . " When several small bombs were set off in Pune on 1 August 2012 , Mithiborwala and Kishore Jagtap called them a " Chitpawan Brahmanical-Manuwadi reaction to the restoration of the true Samadhi-Burial Shrine of Saibai , the first wife of Shivaji Maharaj , " and thus " part of the ongoing caste war that has once again erupted all across Maharashtra . " After the 21 February 2013 terrorist bombing in Hyderabad , Mithiborwala charged the ruling Indian Congress Party with staging it to win conservative Hindu votes . He claimed the bombing would be blamed on fictitious " ' Sleeper Cells ' of disgruntled Muslim youth , who will begin to be picked up from the lanes of this city , " and most of whom " will be police informers & petty criminals who will be entrapped into owning up for this terror attack . " Both the Pune and Hyderabad bombings were believed to have been carried out by the Indian Mujahideen

		GOLD_MENTION=the Lockerbie bombing
		CONTEXT=On 4 October 2009 , Fred Halliday , Emeritus Professor of International Relations at the LSE and the School 's leading expert on the Middle East , wrote a memorandum to the LSE Council regarding the proposed cooperation with the Gaddafi Foundation . " I have repeatedly expressed reservations about formal educational and funding links with that country . " While those in favour of accepting the donation argued that " Libya is changing internally , " most informed observers agree that while some of the worst excesses for the moment have ceased , the rights of its people are badly protected . Libya " remains a country run by a secretive , erratic and corrupt elite . " Since 9/11 the Libyan government has reached compromises with the West on a number of issues , notably the Lockerbie bombing and nuclear weapons . Yet tactical changes in foreign policy are not sufficient for the purposes of evaluating political and academic links . There are also ways in which Libyan foreign policy has '' not '' changed : the country continues to call for the destruction of Israel ; Muammar Gaddafi recently called for the abolition of Switzerland , and he receives the leader of the Somali pirates operating off the Horn of Africa as honoured guests of state . Moreover , Libya 's handling of the Lockerbie bombing " has not been characterised by either consistency or clarity , " I have in the past , Halliday noted , defended accepting grants from authoritarian regimes such as the Gulf states , " but there should be clear limits on this , depending on the degree of political and human rights abuses perpetrated with them and on their ongoing foreign policy conduct . " Whitehall and the City are now happy to do business with Libya , but it does not follow that the LSE should do the same . Responsible leaders throughout the Middle East continue to express reservations regarding Libya , including " its more prominent ' liberal ' representatives . " We must remember , Halliday concluded , that the " liberal " wing within a regime such as Libya does not have the function of producing change but its role is instead " to reach compromises with internal hard-liners that serve to lessen external pressure . " A good case in point are the proposals LSE now is considering . It is , as LSE alumni in positions of responsibility in the region caution , " far too early for the School to take this step . " In 2009 , Human Rights Watch was allowed entry to Libya , via Saif al-Islam Gaddafi 's non-profit organization in order to gather facts about the human rights situation there . While HRW reported that there were concerns about the " repressive atmosphere , " they felt there were signs of " improvement " and Sarah Leah Whitson , director of HRW 's Middle East division said that one should not " underestimate the importance of the efforts made so far " by Gaddafi in the realm of human rights in Libya . She also wrote of her official visit that " the real impetus for the transformation rests squarely with a quasi-governmental organization , the Qaddafi Foundation for International Charities and Development " chaired by Gaddafi . She praised Gaddafi for establishing the country 's two semi-private newspapers , and said " it is impossible to underestimate the importance of the efforts made so far . Let 's hope this spring will last . " In January 2011 , HRW criticised other organisations as well as governments that had previously dealt with Gaddafi . HRW Business and Human Rights Director Arvind Ganesan condemned the London School of Economics ( LSE ) for allowing " abusive and corrupt officials or their families to launder their images in exchange for money " . This was later followed by Ganesen saying that " the London School of Economics did not act until Saif al-Islam 's father literally began to kill his own people " . According to NGO Monitor , this was despite the fact that David Held , Co-Director of LSE Global Governance , was partially influenced by Whitson 's remarks regarding her Libyan visit , referring to Saif al-Islam Gaddafi as a reformer

The following day , the United States also issued a travel warning to Americans to " take precautions in travel to the Sinai " and warned that " overland travel from Israel to the Sinai in particular is strongly discouraged . " Over the weekend prior to the attack on the border , various intelligence reports reaching the IDF 's Southern Command warned of an impending attack . Specific information regarding the time , target , and location of the attack could not be ascertained . Still , Southern Command Maj.-Gen . Tal Russo prepared his troops in case of an attack . Armored , Engineering , and Infantry soldiers were placed on high alert while the Israeli Air Force was deployed in the area as reinforcement . Russo evacuated troops from the Kerem Shalom border crossing , where the militants would later break through , in anticipation of them coming under attack

		CONTEXT=Originally expected for a March 2006 release , the album had two title changes and three unofficial releases until its official release the following year . Initially scheduled for a July 11 , 2006 release , the album 's original draft , entitled '' My Story '' , was eventually shelved in favor of a revamped version with a different vibe . Although manager Mathew Knowles initially insisted that the decision to push the release date from July 2006 was because more time would be needed to properly set up the project , Rowland later admitted that she had been unsatisfied with the album 's direction , and thus , she asked to rework with a stable of new record producers on the project . Speaking of the delay and the original track listing , she told '' Billboard '' : " it was basically a list of songs that I put together about the past three years of my life , with love and relationships " , and added : " And I remember listening to the record , and I was just like , ' I do n't want this to be too deep to where , you know , I lose people .

		CONTEXT=On 4 October 2009 , Fred Halliday , Emeritus Professor of International Relations at the LSE and the School 's leading expert on the Middle East , wrote a memorandum to the LSE Council regarding the proposed cooperation with the Gaddafi Foundation . " I have repeatedly expressed reservations about formal educational and funding links with that country . " While those in favour of accepting the donation argued that " Libya is changing internally , " most informed observers agree that while some of the worst excesses for the moment have ceased , the rights of its people are badly protected . Libya " remains a country run by a secretive , erratic and corrupt elite . " Since 9/11 the Libyan government has reached compromises with the West on a number of issues , notably the Lockerbie bombing and nuclear weapons . Yet tactical changes in foreign policy are not sufficient for the purposes of evaluating political and academic links . There are also ways in which Libyan foreign policy has '' not '' changed : the country continues to call for the destruction of Israel ; Muammar Gaddafi recently called for the abolition of Switzerland , and he receives the leader of the Somali pirates operating off the Horn of Africa as honoured guests of state . Moreover , Libya 's handling of the Lockerbie bombing " has not been characterised by either consistency or clarity , " I have in the past , Halliday noted , defended accepting grants from authoritarian regimes such as the Gulf states , " but there should be clear limits on this , depending on the degree of political and human rights abuses perpetrated with them and on their ongoing foreign policy conduct . " Whitehall and the City are now happy to do business with Libya , but it does not follow that the LSE should do the same . Responsible leaders throughout the Middle East continue to express reservations regarding Libya , including " its more prominent ' liberal ' representatives . " We must remember , Halliday concluded , that the " liberal " wing within a regime such as Libya does not have the function of producing change but its role is instead " to reach compromises with internal hard-liners that serve to lessen external pressure . " A good case in point are the proposals LSE now is considering . It is , as LSE alumni in positions of responsibility in the region caution , " far too early for the School to take this step . " In 2009 , Human Rights Watch was allowed entry to Libya , via Saif al-Islam Gaddafi 's non-profit organization in order to gather facts about the human rights situation there . While HRW reported that there were concerns about the " repressive atmosphere , " they felt there were signs of " improvement " and Sarah Leah Whitson , director of HRW 's Middle East division said that one should not " underestimate the importance of the efforts made so far " by Gaddafi in the realm of human rights in Libya . She also wrote of her official visit that " the real impetus for the transformation rests squarely with a quasi-governmental organization , the Qaddafi Foundation for International Charities and Development " chaired by Gaddafi . She praised Gaddafi for establishing the country 's two semi-private newspapers , and said " it is impossible to underestimate the importance of the efforts made so far . Let 's hope this spring will last . " In January 2011 , HRW criticised other organisations as well as governments that had previously dealt with Gaddafi . HRW Business and Human Rights Director Arvind Ganesan condemned the London School of Economics ( LSE ) for allowing " abusive and corrupt officials or their families to launder their images in exchange for money " . This was later followed by Ganesen saying that " the London School of Economics did not act until Saif al-Islam 's father literally began to kill his own people " . According to NGO Monitor , this was despite the fact that David Held , Co-Director of LSE Global Governance , was partially influenced by Whitson 's remarks regarding her Libyan visit , referring to Saif al-Islam Gaddafi as a reformer

		CONTEXT=Since the early 2000s , Sinai has been the site of several terror attacks against tourists , the majority of whom are Egyptian . Investigations have shown that these were mainly motivated by a resentment of the poverty faced by many Bedouin in the area . Attacking the tourist industry was viewed as a method of damaging the industry so that the government would pay more attention to their situation . ( See 2004 Sinai bombings , 2005 Sharm El Sheikh bombings and 2006 Dahab bombings ) . Since the 2011 Egyptian Revolution , unrest has become more prevalent in the area including the 2012 Egyptian-Israeli border attack in which 16 Egyptian soldiers were killed by militants . ( See Sinai insurgency . ) Also on the rise are kidnappings of refugees . According to Meron Estifanos , Eritrean refugees are often kidnapped by Bedouin in the northern Sinai , tortured , raped , and only released after receiving a large ransom

The cable came in the wake of the midnight raids on August 21 by the regime of Ngo Dinh Diem against Buddhist pagodas across the country , in which hundreds were believed to have been killed . The raids were orchestrated by Diem 's brother Ngô Đình Nhu and precipitated a change in US policy . The cable declared that Washington would no longer tolerate Nhu remaining in a position of power and ordered Lodge to pressure Diem to remove his brother . It said that if Diem refused , the Americans would explore the possibility for alternative leadership in South Vietnam . In effect , the cable authorized Lodge to give the green light to Army of the Republic of Vietnam ( ARVN ) officers to launch a coup against Diem if he did not willingly remove Nhu from power . The cable marked a turning point in US - Diem relations and was described in the Pentagon Papers as " controversial . " The historian John M. Newman described it as " the single most controversial cable of the Vietnam War . "

		ANSWER=Frankfurter
		GOLD_MENTION=Preparedness Day Bombing
		CONTEXT=In September 1917 , he was appointed counsel to a commission , the President 's Mediation Committee , established by President Wilson to resolve major strikes threatening war production . Among the disturbances he investigated were the 1916 Preparedness Day Bombing in San Francisco , where he argued strongly that the radical leader Thomas Mooney had been framed and required a new trial . He also examined the copper industry in Arizona , where industry bosses solved industrial relations problems by having more than 1,000 strikers forcibly deported to New Mexico . Overall , Frankfurter 's work gave him an opportunity to learn firsthand about labor politics and extremism , including anarchism , communism and revolutionary socialism . He came to sympathize with labor issues , arguing that " unsatisfactory , remediable social conditions , if unattended , give rise to radical movements far transcending the original impulse . " His activities led the public to view him as a radical lawyer and supporter of radical principles . Former President Theodore Roosevelt accused him of being " engaged in excusing men precisely like the Bolsheviki in Russia . " Frankfurter and Supreme Court justice Louis Brandeis secretly collaborated over many years on numerous covert political activities . The relationship began after Brandeis secured Frankfurter a position at Harvard through Jacob Schiff . Brandeis enlisted Frankfurter as his paid political lobbyist and lieutenant . In May 1917 when U.S. Secretary of State Robert Lansing received a report that the Ottomans were extremely weary of the war and that it might be possible to induce them to break with Germany and make a separate peace with Britain , Brandeis and Frankfurter worked to prevent this from occurring . Frankfurter became part of the delegation and persuaded the delegation ’s leader , former Ambassador Henry J. Morgenthau , to abandon the effort . This was described in books by Jehuda Reinharz , Peter Grose , Peter Balakian , and Charles Glass , as reported in '' Against Our Better Judgement '' , by Alison Weir

The collection of original documents that Ehrenburg handed down to the Vilnius Jewish Museum after the war was secretly returned to him upon the Museum 's termination in 1948 . The JAC was also disbanded , its members purged at the outset of the state campaign against the " rootless cosmopolitans " , a Soviet euphemism for Jews . ( See also the Doctors ' plot ) .

		ANSWER=class politics can not be reinvented , rebuilt , reinvigorated or rescued . Why ? Because any dynamic political outlook needs to exist in an interaction with existing individual consciousness
		GOLD_MENTION=mass murder
		CONTEXT=In 1988 , the party made '' The Next Step '' into a bulletin for its supporters . Later that year , a monthly magazine called '' Living Marxism '' was set up for a wider readership . Despite its beginnings as a far-left outlet , the politics espoused by the magazine developed a pronounced libertarianism . In December 1990 , '' Living Marxism '' ran an article which argued that the corrosive effect of the collapse of both Stalinism and reformism on the working class meant that " for the time being at least , the working class has no political existence " . In 1997 , the point was put more forcefully : In today 's circumstances class politics can not be reinvented , rebuilt , reinvigorated or rescued . Why ? Because any dynamic political outlook needs to exist in an interaction with existing individual consciousness . And contemporary forms of consciousness in our atomised societies can not be used as the foundation for a more developed politics of solidarity . Between 1990 and 1997 , the party developed the view that more than capitalism itself the danger facing humanity was the absence of a force for social change ( in philosophical language , a " subject " of history ) and the culture of low expectations that suppressed it . Prefacing a 1996 '' Living Marxism '' manifesto , Mick Hume argued : Of course ... we could have produced a familiar list of left-wing slogans complaining about problems like unemployment , exploitation and poverty which continue to scar our society . But that would be to ignore the transformation which has taken place in the political climate ... . At different times , different issues matter most . Each era has thrown up its own great questions which define which side you are on ... . A t '' Living Marxism '' , we see our job today as doing much more than criticising capitalism . That is the easy bit . There is a more pressing need to criticise the fatalistic critics , to counter the doom-mongers and put a positive case for human action in pursuit of social liberation . ... D ealing with ... unconventional questions , and puncturing the anti-human prejudices which surround them , is the precondition for making political action possible in our time . In February 1997 , shortly after the party disbanded , '' Living Marxism '' re-branded as '' LM '' , possibly to further distance itself from its leftist origins . Articles in '' LM '' argued : This magazine ran at least two articles in which the authors argued that the mass murder carried out in Rwanda in 1994 should not be described as genocide . In December 1995 , '' LM '' carried a report from an aid worker in Rwanda which argued : The lesson I would draw from my visit is that we must reject the term ' genocide ' in Rwanda . It has been used inside and outside Rwanda to criminalise the majority of ordinary Rwandan people , to justify outside interference in the country 's affairs , and to lend legitimacy to a minority military government imposed on Rwanda by Western powers . '' LM '' continued to create controversy on a variety of issues , most notably on the British Independent Television News ( ITN ) coverage of the Balkan conflict in the 1990s . The controversy centred on '' LM '' featuring an article by Thomas Deichmann in which he alleged that the ITN coverage of a refugee detention centre in Trnopolje during the conflict gave the false impression that the Bosnian Muslims were being held against their will in Serbian concentration camps . The ensuing libel award and costs arising from legal action by the ITN against '' LM '' were estimated to total around £ 1 million . The action bankrupted the magazine and its publishers

		ANSWER=Frankfurter
		GOLD_MENTION=Preparedness Day Bombing
		CONTEXT=In September 1917 , he was appointed counsel to a commission , the President 's Mediation Committee , established by President Wilson to resolve major strikes threatening war production . Among the disturbances he investigated were the 1916 Preparedness Day Bombing in San Francisco , where he argued strongly that the radical leader Thomas Mooney had been framed and required a new trial . He also examined the copper industry in Arizona , where industry bosses solved industrial relations problems by having more than 1,000 strikers forcibly deported to New Mexico . Overall , Frankfurter 's work gave him an opportunity to learn firsthand about labor politics and extremism , including anarchism , communism and revolutionary socialism . He came to sympathize with labor issues , arguing that " unsatisfactory , remediable social conditions , if unattended , give rise to radical movements far transcending the original impulse . " His activities led the public to view him as a radical lawyer and supporter of radical principles . Former President Theodore Roosevelt accused him of being " engaged in excusing men precisely like the Bolsheviki in Russia . " Frankfurter and Supreme Court justice Louis Brandeis secretly collaborated over many years on numerous covert political activities . The relationship began after Brandeis secured Frankfurter a position at Harvard through Jacob Schiff . Brandeis enlisted Frankfurter as his paid political lobbyist and lieutenant . In May 1917 when U.S. Secretary of State Robert Lansing received a report that the Ottomans were extremely weary of the war and that it might be possible to induce them to break with Germany and make a separate peace with Britain , Brandeis and Frankfurter worked to prevent this from occurring . Frankfurter became part of the delegation and persuaded the delegation ’s leader , former Ambassador Henry J. Morgenthau , to abandon the effort . This was described in books by Jehuda Reinharz , Peter Grose , Peter Balakian , and Charles Glass , as reported in '' Against Our Better Judgement '' , by Alison Weir

		GOLD_MENTION=
		CONTEXT=Expedition Robinson : 2005 , was the ninth version of Expedition Robinson , or Survivor as it is referred to in some countries , to air in Sweden and it aired in 2005 . The major twist this season was that the contestants were divided into tribes based on their annual salaries , with the North team being the " rich " team and the South team being the " poor " team . Another twist was that of the change in voting format , all contestants were given thirteen votes that they could use at any time and in any amount . Robert Drakwind , formerly known as Robert Andersson , returned to compete for a third time since 1999 along with his girlfriend , Anna Carin Wase . Both were " jokers " and did not enter the competition until episode 3 . Both jokers became " chiefs " of one of the tribes and were given immunity at all pre-merge tribal councils , however from episode 4 on they could be challenged by any member of their tribe for the position of chief . If challenged , the chief and challenger would face off in a duel in which the winner would become chief and the loser would be eliminated from the competition . The final twist of the season was that of the " Finalist Island " . Introduced in a challenge immediately preceding the merge , contestants would compete in a series of duels in which the winner would earn a spot on Finalist Island . The two contestants left on Finalist Island when only seven contestants were left would have immunity until the final four , while the remaining five contestants not on the island would have to compete for the two remaining spots . Karolina and Max were the last two contestants on Finalist Island . Ultimately , Karolina Conrad went on to win the season with a jury vote of 6 – 5 over Max Stjernfelt .

		CONTEXT=Among the distinctions awarded to " My Number One " was that it was chosen among thirteen other Eurovision songs to compete in the '' Congratulations '' 50th anniversary special in 2005 , just a few months after Paparizou 's victory .

At the end of the first round , " My Number One " was announced as one of the five songs proceeding to the second and final round . It was later revealed that it placed fourth in the first round , with 167 points ( in both rounds , Greece were allowed to award themselves the maximum twelve points , a privilege usually not given at Eurovision )

		CONTEXT=In January 2007 , it was announced that either " Your Love Is Right Over Me , " " Even Heaven Cries , " or " Push Up on Me " would be the next single and Starwatch started a poll asking the fans to decide . However , " Even Heaven Cries " finished first with 47 % of all votes and was eventually chosen as the group 's second single . Thus , the song also served as the albums 's competition song in the pre-selection show of the 52nd Eurovision Song Contest 2007 but to get a better result than the under deadline pressure mixed album version , the girls re-entered recording studios with Thorsten Brötzmann to re-record several parts of the song . However , the shortened single version of the song world-premiered on the ProSieben network 's prime time boxing show '' ProSieben Fight Night '' on February 16 , 2007

Vondráčková was the only name which ČT confirmed as a Eurosong 2007 entrant prior to the official 15 February 2007 announcement of Eurosong 2007 entrants : this announcement stated that Vondráčková would be competing with a track from her 23 October 2006 album release '' Zastav Se ( ... A Poslouchej ) '' entitled " Samba " . Although the Eurosong 2007 final was not broadcast by ČT until 10 March 2007 the competing songs were made available for listening from the time of their announcement with voting - done by SMS - open from 23 February 2007 : around the last-named date ČT announced the disqualification of " Samba " citing the track had been recorded too far in advance to be considered as a possible entrant for Eurovision 2007 . Vondráčková , given the prerogative of competing in Eurosong 2007 with a more recent song , did submit the track " Ha ha ha " but soon withdrew from Eurosong 2007 citing her disenchantment with the winner being chosen by SMS voting

		CONTEXT=In late 1999 , Timberlake appeared in the Disney Channel movie '' Model Behavior '' . He played Jason Sharpe , a model who falls in love with a waitress after mistaking her for another model . It was released on March 12 , 2000 . The rise of his own stardom and the general decline in the popularity of boy bands led to the dissolution of NSYNC . Band member Lance Bass was openly critical of Timberlake 's actions in his memoir '' Out of Sync '' . By 2002 , when the group went on a hiatus and members were following individual projects , he partnered with Pharrell Williams of the producing team The Neptunes – and Timbaland to start working in new music . The idea of going solo was strengthened a year earlier . Timberlake originally wrote the single " Gone " around 2001 for Michael Jackson , but he turned the song down , and was instead recorded by NSYNC . After released , however , Jackson contacted him . Timberlake declared in a later interview that the first time he felt confident to go solo happened after that conversation : In August 2002 , Timberlake performed at the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards , where he premiered his debut solo single " Like I Love You " ; it peaked at number 11 on the '' Billboard '' Hot 100 and number two on the UK Singles Chart . His debut solo studio album '' Justified '' was released in November and debuted at number two on the '' Billboard '' 200 with first-week sales of 439,000 copies , fewer than previous 'N Sync releases . It went on to sell over three million copies in the U.S. and more than ten million copies worldwide . Its R&B influence , provided by hip-hop producers The Neptunes and Timbaland , was complimented by music critics . About the musical direction of the record , he commented , " I just want to do R&B . It 's what I grew up listening to " . The album spawned the top-five singles " Cry Me a River " and " Rock Your Body " . In summer 2003 , Timberlake and Christina Aguilera headlined the Justified/Stripped Tour . Later that year he recorded a song " I 'm Lovin ' It " , used by McDonald 's as the theme to its " I 'm Lovin ' It " campaign . The deal with McDonald 's earned Timberlake an estimated $ 6 million . A tour titled Justified and Lovin ' It Live was included with the deal , following his initial Justified World Tour . Timberlake was featured on Nelly 's song , " Work It " , which was remixed and included on Nelly 's 2003 remix album

		GOLD_MENTION=Columbine High School massacre
		CONTEXT=Marilyn Manson 's performance in Denver , Colorado on June 22 , 2001 at the Mile High Stadium also drew attention from the national news media . The event was part of their commitments with the heavy metal festival tour Ozzfest and marked the band 's first performance in the state since the Columbine High School massacre in nearby Littleton , Colorado on April 20 , 1999 . The band was initially blamed for inciting shooters Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold into killing their classmates , though these reports would later be proven to be false . The band initially pulled out due to scheduling conflicts , however , the group later altered their plans in order to accommodate the Denver date . The band met heavy resistance from conservative groups and the performer received numerous death threats and calls to skip the date . A group of church leaders and families related to the Columbine tragedy formed an organization specifically to oppose their show called ' Citizens for Peace and Respect ' , which drew the support of Colorado governor Bill Owens ( R-Colo ) and representative Tom Tancredo ( R-Colo ) . The group held a rally outside the Mile High Stadium where organizer , youth pastor Jason Janz , delivered a speech stating , " If Marilyn Manson can walk into our town , promote hate , violence , suicide , death , drug use and Columbine-like behavior , I can say , ' Not without a fight you ca n't . ' " Janz further said , " We do n't think Manson caused Columbine , but he encourages and legitimizes Columbine-like behavior . " Marilyn Manson responded to the assertions of ' Citizens for Peace and Respect ' by issuing a statement saying , A group of Marilyn Manson supporters also responded to ' Citizens for Peace and Respect ' by forming an organization called ' Citizens for the Protection of the Right to Free Speech ' . The group held a rally in front of the Colorado State Capitol where organizer Carrieanne Andrews , a mother of three , stated that " We just wanted to show that Jason Janz does not speak for our entire community " and that they resented " being told how to be good parents . " The Denver show would later provide the backdrop for Manson 's landmark interview on America 's climate of fear and culture of gun violence in Michael Moore 's 2002 documentary '' Bowling for Columbine '' . When Moore asked what he would have said if he had the opportunity to speak to the students at Columbine , he replied , " I would n't say a single word . I would listen to what they have to say and that 's what no one did . " Another incident took place leading up to The Gig On The Green festival on August 25 , 2001 in Glasgow , Scotland . Members of the Glasgow community were calling for Marilyn Manson 's performance at the festival to be boycotted . Beth Nimmo , the mother of the Columbine killer 's first victim , Rachel Scott , joined in the protests and told Scottish tabloid newspaper '' Daily Record '' on August 8 , 2001 , " I do n't doubt that his kind of music definitely affects young people and can desensitize them . People need to be strong enough not to listen to it . There is nothing entertaining about real violence . It has real consequences and brings nothing but destruction and pain . " In a separate incident , a Catholic Charismatic Renewal group protested in early August 2001 at the Glasgow city centre , where the Glasgow City Council were deciding on the final licensing application for Gig On The Green . This was due the inclusion of both Eminem and Marilyn Manson on the bill . Both attempts failed

Return to Zero stars a fearless Minnie Driver and the ever-affable Paul Adelstein as a couple rocked to their emotional core by the loss of their unborn child , discovered to have died in the womb shortly before the delivery date . We follow them through the wrenching procedure and recovery process with a stark realism in which husband and wife are often seen at their worst , as their once-solid relationship frays when Maggie plummets into depression and neither seem able to say or do the right things to be able to heal and move on . Though sometimes hard to watch , Zero is a compelling and beautifully acted character study that will make you care as it dramatizes a domestic tragedy with a minimum of melodrama , so rare for TV and TV-movies . " Robert Bianco of '' USA Today '' wrote , " Minnie Driver and Paul Adelstein give first-rate performances in this lovely , moving film about a couple whose marriage falters when their baby is stillborn … It 's a subject worthy of education and one that seldom gets dealt with on television . " Brian Lowry of '' Variety '' called '' Return to Zero '' " a painful portrait of devastating loss , pivoting on a performance by Minnie Driver that acutely captures those raw feelings . " He also wrote , " Hanish deftly zeroes in on how all the preparation and enthusiasm surrounding a new baby magnifies the enormity of the parents ’ pain here — as well as the different ways people cope , or do n’t , with such events .

However Tom merely points to two giant sacks of complimentary mail he has carried on his bike from RTÉ headquarters . One of them even wants to sleep with the presenter , who quickly places the letter in the left front pocket of his dressing gown . Pat is astounded to discover he is all over the news and that celebrities such as 1992 Eurovision Song Contest winner Linda Martin , music mogul Louis Walsh and Boyzone lead singer Ronan Keating are talking about him . He hurries indoors to switch on his television . There he finds that figures from the worlds of sport and politics including Irish national football team manager Steve Staunton , Ireland rugby manager Eddie O'Sullivan and Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams are lining up in their droves to pay tribute to him . He is intrigued to find Fintan O'Toole has also spoken greatly of him but becomes irritated when he finds that Steve Staunton seems to have taken over the airwaves , typically reiterating how Pat has done a great job , how he works for the team , has delivered a great result and what else can you say . Meanwhile , Bertie Ahern repeatedly rings Tom 's mobile to request an interview with Pat , but on each occasion Tom tells him to ring back later . Pat and Tom stroll into RTÉ , where George Hook is astounded to hear of Pat 's newfound popularity . He is adamant that Tom will soon join him at Newstalk but Tom shows his unswaying loyalty by declaring he will go only where Pat goes . On Friday night George slips into RTÉ and just as an episode of '' The Late Late Show '' is coming to a close , approaches Pat 's dressing room . George is inadvertently knocked to the floor by a stray microphone where he lies moaning until Pat emerges from the dressing room . Pat steps over George and leaves RTÉ with Tom , telling his assistant that he should not allow anyone to undermine him before demanding that he open the door

		ANSWER=Gaga
		GOLD_MENTION=Brit Awards
		CONTEXT=Gaga performed " Dance in the Dark " at the Brit Awards on February 16 , 2010 , at Earls Court Exhibition Centre . The performance was inspired by the recent death of her friend , fashion designer Alexander McQueen . Initially she had planned a different version of the performance , but changed the concept at the last minute , since she wanted to pay tribute to McQueen . Hence she chose acoustic versions of her songs " Telephone " and " Dance in the Dark " . She started the performance by sitting in front of a piano and announcing " This is for Alexander McQueen . " The whole performance was low-key compared to her previous ones . The stage was decked out in white , and perched on a pedestal was a statue of Gaga wearing a piano skirt and the lobster-claw heels she wore in her " Bad Romance " music video . After finishing an acoustic performance of " Telephone " , she got up from her piano as the disco groove of " Dance in the Dark " was heard throughout the room . She wore a lace bodysuit and a large bouffant wig , took to a giant keytar and performed a techno rendition of the track . After the show , she posted a message on her Twitter account : " Tonight 's performance is inspired by our friend . Mask by Phillip Treacy , Sculpture by Nick Knight , Music by Lady Gaga . We miss you . " " Dance in the Dark " is performed on the singer 's 2018 – 2019 Las Vegas residency show , Lady Gaga Enigma .

The message of the plot is that a lack of sophistication is the key to success , even at a fashion magazine that attracts readers through sexy exhibitionism . The movie would have shown some daring savvy if it had played more with the role-playing aspect of fashion spreads . Instead it is content to eat its retro snack cake and have it , too . " Andrea Gronvall of the '' Chicago Reader '' wrote that " The formula works , thanks in large part to star Jennifer Garner , who 's so radiant theaters should be stocking sunblock . Underlying the shenanigans and the pop-psychology moral — self-love is a prerequisite for true love — there 's a touching wistfulness about roads not taken . " Jorge Morales of '' The Village Voice '' commented : " The thirtysomething in me was all , gag me with a spoon , but the kid in me was like , this movie 's rad to the max .

		ANSWER=Janet Jackson
		GOLD_MENTION=1987 MTV Video Music Awards
		CONTEXT=Jam and Lewis were the primary instrumentalists for the recording , including percussion , piano , drums , and also provided background vocals . Jackson accompanied Jam and Lewis on keyboard and took part in composing the arrangements . Stephen Holden of '' The New York Times '' observed the album was prominent example of the developing relationship with musicians and modern technology , stating " ... technology has altered the form , shape , scale and even the meaning of popular music ... The album was n't created by a studio band , as were most pop-rock albums in the 1960s and '70s , but by the producers and the singer programming mechanized drum and keyboard textures . " Jackson 's father disapproved of the new material and image of '' Control '' , claiming it would never sell . In a cover story for '' Spin '' magazine titled " Damn It , Janet : The Battle for Control of Janet Jackson , " Joseph was reported saying " i f Janet listens to me , she 'll be as big as Michael . " She and McClain disregarded his objections . Commenting on the final product , Jackson stated : " It 's aggressive , cocky , very forward . It expresses exactly who I am and how I feel . I 've taken control of my own life . This time I 'm gon na do it my way . " Fashion photographer and illustrator Tony Viramontes created the stylized cover for the new album and the singles '' Nasty '' and '' Control '' . Jackson said of Viramontes , " He was very creative , and I believe one day his work will be iconic . He was such a joy to work with . I miss him . " Author Dean Rhys Morgan in '' Bold , Beautiful and Damned : The World of Fashion Illustrator Tony Viramontes '' discusses how Jackson was " transformed from a former child star into an assured fashion forward figure with her trendsetting big hair and severe all black ensemble . Until this point , Jackson had been more a reflection than pioneer , more interpreter than innovator . This album was all about Janet and who she wanted to be . " Alexander Fury wrote in '' The Independent '' , " the artwork created with Eighties illustrator Tony Viramontes for '' Control '' stands the test of time . " Although A&M did not consider a full concert tour to promote Jackson 's album , the label funded a three-week promotional tour across the United States in 13 cities following its release . In addition to the studio release , a remix album , '' Control : The Remixes '' , was released in select countries in November , 1987 . Jackson 's lyrical expression has been noted as one of the key elements of the album 's success . Author Dave Marsh in '' The Heart of Rock & Soul : The 1001 Greatest Singles Ever Made '' ( 1999 ) comments : " Certainly , Janet must have written her own lyrics , which went after men — in particular , not very well disguised stand-ins for her father and former husband — more venomously than another guy would have dared . '' Control '' , the resulting album , was one of the best-sellers of 1986 – 1987 , producing five hit singles . " Jesus Garber , then-director of A&M 's black music marketing and promotion , noted that in addition to crossover promotion from black to pop music charts , music video was utilized to launch Jackson into super stardom . Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine credits the release of '' Control '' as " the birth of Janet the music video star , as six of the nine tracks were turned into popular videos that all but announced her as queen of the production dance number . " Henderson commented that Jackson 's dancing ability , trained by a then-unknown Paula Abdul , only served to propel her into further stardom . Charlie Minor , then-senior vice president of promotion for A&M stated : " The images completed the image of Janet Jackson with the buyer ... They gave her a face , dance , action identity with the songs , and a visual image of her as a rock 'n' roll star . " Jonathan Cohen of '' Billboard '' magazine commented " Jackson 's accessible sound and spectacularly choreographed videos were irresistible to MTV , and helped the channel evolve from rock programming to a broader , beat-driven musical mix . " The video for " Nasty " received three nominations for the fifth annual 1987 MTV Video Music Awards , winning Best Choreography for Paula Abdul

		GOLD_MENTION=1992 Eurovision Song Contest
		CONTEXT=Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny appears at his back door in his boxers and invites viewers for a look around his house ; including a ( now fully dressed ) encounter with his karaoke machine . He then sets off on his bicycle for an interview at RTÉ . Alas his attempts to get there unscathed come undone when his bike receives a puncture and he has to resort to queueing for a bus like the common person . When the bus arrives , he realises he has no money but after asking for some spare cash from an innocent bystander , he turns around to find the bus has pulled off again . In the RTÉ carpark , Pat Kenny sits in his car , casting his eyes over his fellow broadcasters and enviously longing to join them in their casual conversation . When he finally plucks up the courage to approach Marian Finucane and Joe Duffy , the latter is overheard insulting him and Pat heads back to his car . With Pat due on air in ten minutes , Tom decides to join him in the passenger seat but he must first overcome the clutches of George Hook , who once again attempts to lure him to Newstalk . Pat asks Tom what the world really thinks of him , believing that his assistant is the only person in the world who is loyal to him . Tom attempts to avoid the question , distracting Pat by ( wrongly ) telling him that Enda Kenny has just arrived . Eventually Tom opts to tell Pat , albeit with much hesitation , that he is '' " absolutely unbelievable " '' . At that moment Enda Kenny finally arrives at the studio , still in his biker gear and collapses with exhaustion on the steps having raced through Dublin to make the interview on schedule . Kenny and Kenny square off on air and , with Pat faced with an adversary so similar in perceived personality , popularity and name he is even more unable to cope with his feelings of unworthiness than usual . Pat breaks down live on air , mistaking Enda 's rival , Taoiseach Bertie Ahern , for his own rival , '' Liveline '' presenter Joe Duffy . This prompts Enda to join him in his moment of unrelenting emotion . The next morning Tom arrives at Pat 's house . Pat assumes he has come with his P45 or details of who is to take over the mantle of the station 's highest earning broadcaster . However Tom merely points to two giant sacks of complimentary mail he has carried on his bike from RTÉ headquarters . One of them even wants to sleep with the presenter , who quickly places the letter in the left front pocket of his dressing gown . Pat is astounded to discover he is all over the news and that celebrities such as 1992 Eurovision Song Contest winner Linda Martin , music mogul Louis Walsh and Boyzone lead singer Ronan Keating are talking about him . He hurries indoors to switch on his television . There he finds that figures from the worlds of sport and politics including Irish national football team manager Steve Staunton , Ireland rugby manager Eddie O'Sullivan and Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams are lining up in their droves to pay tribute to him . He is intrigued to find Fintan O'Toole has also spoken greatly of him but becomes irritated when he finds that Steve Staunton seems to have taken over the airwaves , typically reiterating how Pat has done a great job , how he works for the team , has delivered a great result and what else can you say . Meanwhile , Bertie Ahern repeatedly rings Tom 's mobile to request an interview with Pat , but on each occasion Tom tells him to ring back later . Pat and Tom stroll into RTÉ , where George Hook is astounded to hear of Pat 's newfound popularity . He is adamant that Tom will soon join him at Newstalk but Tom shows his unswaying loyalty by declaring he will go only where Pat goes . On Friday night George slips into RTÉ and just as an episode of '' The Late Late Show '' is coming to a close , approaches Pat 's dressing room . George is inadvertently knocked to the floor by a stray microphone where he lies moaning until Pat emerges from the dressing room . Pat steps over George and leaves RTÉ with Tom , telling his assistant that he should not allow anyone to undermine him before demanding that he open the door

In addition to the studio release , a remix album , '' Control : The Remixes '' , was released in select countries in November , 1987 . Jackson 's lyrical expression has been noted as one of the key elements of the album 's success . Author Dave Marsh in '' The Heart of Rock & Soul : The 1001 Greatest Singles Ever Made '' ( 1999 ) comments : " Certainly , Janet must have written her own lyrics , which went after men — in particular , not very well disguised stand-ins for her father and former husband — more venomously than another guy would have dared . '' Control '' , the resulting album , was one of the best-sellers of 1986 – 1987 , producing five hit singles . " Jesus Garber , then-director of A&M 's black music marketing and promotion , noted that in addition to crossover promotion from black to pop music charts , music video was utilized to launch Jackson into super stardom . Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine credits the release of '' Control '' as " the birth of Janet the music video star , as six of the nine tracks were turned into popular videos that all but announced her as queen of the production dance number . " Henderson commented that Jackson 's dancing ability , trained by a then-unknown Paula Abdul , only served to propel her into further stardom . Charlie Minor , then-senior vice president of promotion for A&M stated : " The images completed the image of Janet Jackson with the buyer ... They gave her a face , dance , action identity with the songs , and a visual image of her as a rock 'n' roll star . " Jonathan Cohen of '' Billboard '' magazine commented " Jackson 's accessible sound and spectacularly choreographed videos were irresistible to MTV , and helped the channel evolve from rock programming to a broader , beat-driven musical mix . " The video for " Nasty " received three nominations for the fifth annual 1987 MTV Video Music Awards , winning Best Choreography for Paula Abdul

		CONTEXT=Loft jazz ( or the loft scene or loft era ) was a cultural phenomenon that occurred in New York City during the mid-1970s . Gary Giddins described it as follows : " [ A ] new coterie of avant - garde musicians took much of the jazz world by surprise ... [ T ] hey interpreted the idea of freedom as the capacity to choose between all the realms of jazz , mixing and matching them not only with each other , but with old and new pop , r & b and rock , classical music and world music ... [ S ] eemingly overnight new venues - in many instances , apartments or lofts ( hence the phrase ' loft jazz ' ) - opened shop to present their wares . " According to Michael Heller , " lofts were not an organization , nor a movement , nor an ideology , nor a genre , nor a neighborhood , nor a lineage of individuals . They were , instead , a meeting point , a locus for interaction . " Heller stated that " loft practices came to be defined by a number of key characteristics , including ( 1 ) low admission charges or suggested donations , ( 2 ) casual atmospheres that blurred the distinction between performer and audience , ( 3 ) ownership / administration by musicians , and ( 4 ) mixed - use spaces that combined both private living areas and public presentation space . " Regarding the music played in these venues , Michael J. Agovino wrote : " This was community music . Part of the point was that , free of the strictures of clubs , the music could be anything , go anywhere , go on for as long as it wanted . " David Such stated that " the cutting contests , personality cults , and vices that characterized the jazz scene of the 1940s and 1950s were mostly missing . " The scene was reviewed and documented by Giddins , Peter Occhiogrosso of the SoHo Weekly News , Leroi Jones , Robert Palmer , and Stanley Crouch .

" Although A&M did not consider a full concert tour to promote Jackson 's album , the label funded a three-week promotional tour across the United States in 13 cities following its release . In addition to the studio release , a remix album , '' Control : The Remixes '' , was released in select countries in November , 1987 . Jackson 's lyrical expression has been noted as one of the key elements of the album 's success . Author Dave Marsh in '' The Heart of Rock & Soul : The 1001 Greatest Singles Ever Made '' ( 1999 ) comments : " Certainly , Janet must have written her own lyrics , which went after men — in particular , not very well disguised stand-ins for her father and former husband — more venomously than another guy would have dared . '' Control '' , the resulting album , was one of the best-sellers of 1986 – 1987 , producing five hit singles . " Jesus Garber , then-director of A&M 's black music marketing and promotion , noted that in addition to crossover promotion from black to pop music charts , music video was utilized to launch Jackson into super stardom . Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine credits the release of '' Control '' as " the birth of Janet the music video star , as six of the nine tracks were turned into popular videos that all but announced her as queen of the production dance number . " Henderson commented that Jackson 's dancing ability , trained by a then-unknown Paula Abdul , only served to propel her into further stardom . Charlie Minor , then-senior vice president of promotion for A&M stated : " The images completed the image of Janet Jackson with the buyer ... They gave her a face , dance , action identity with the songs , and a visual image of her as a rock 'n' roll star . " Jonathan Cohen of '' Billboard '' magazine commented " Jackson 's accessible sound and spectacularly choreographed videos were irresistible to MTV , and helped the channel evolve from rock programming to a broader , beat-driven musical mix . " The video for " Nasty " received three nominations for the fifth annual 1987 MTV Video Music Awards , winning Best Choreography for Paula Abdul

		CONTEXT=Schaffner likens the Beatles ' 1966 recordings to the moment of transformation in the film '' Wizard of Oz '' , " where , when Dorothy discovers herself transported from Kansas to Oz , the film dramatically changes from black-and-white to glorious technicolor " . The album was the source of confusion for the group 's more conservative fans ; a female fan later complained in '' Beatles Monthly '' that 1966 represented the end of " The Beatles we used to know before they went stark , raving mad " . The release coincided with a period of public relations challenges for the band , the combination of which led to their decision to retire from touring following the end of their North American tour , on 29 August . In the US , the album 's release was a secondary event to the controversy surrounding the recent publication there of Cleave 's interview with Lennon , in which he had remarked that the Beatles had become " more popular than Jesus " . This episode followed the unfavourable reaction to the '' Yesterday and Today '' butcher sleeve , from the press , radio stations and retail outlets . As a result , at press conferences during the tour , questions were typically focused on religious matters rather than the band 's new music . In addition , the group were vocal in their opposition to the Vietnam War , a stand that further redefined their public image in the US

		GOLD_MENTION=tour that started in West Germany
		CONTEXT=By 1966 , the Beatles had grown weary of live performance . In John Lennon 's opinion , they could " send out four waxworks ... and that would satisfy the crowds . Beatles concerts are nothing to do with music anymore . They 're just bloody tribal rites . " In June that year , two days after finishing the album '' Revolver '' , the group set off for a tour that started in West Germany . While in Hamburg they received an anonymous telegram stating : " Do not go to Tokyo . Your life is in danger . " The threat was taken seriously in light of the controversy surrounding the tour among Japan 's religious and conservative groups , with particular opposition to the Beatles ' planned performances at the sacred Nippon Budokan arena . As an added precaution , 35,000 police were mobilised and tasked with protecting the group , who were transported from hotels to concert venues in armoured vehicles . The Beatles then performed in the Philippines , where they were threatened and manhandled by its citizens for not visiting First Lady Imelda Marcos . The group were angry with their manager , Brian Epstein , for insisting on what they regarded as an exhausting and demoralising itinerary

		GOLD_MENTION=Her performances
		CONTEXT=The 2018 festival featured headlining performances from The Weeknd , Beyoncé , and Eminem . Making up for her cancellation the previous year , Beyoncé became the first African-American woman to headline the festival . Her performances paid tribute to the culture of historically black colleges and universities , featuring a full marching band and majorette dancers , while incorporating various aspects of black Greek life , such as a step show along with strolling by pledges . The performances were also influenced by black feminism , sampling black authors and featuring on-stage appearances by fellow Destiny 's Child members Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams as well as sister Solange Knowles . Beyoncé 's performances received immediate , widespread praise , and were described by many media outlets as historic . '' The New York Times '' music critic Jon Caramanica wrote , " There 's not likely to be a more meaningful , absorbing , forceful and radical performance by an American musician this year , or any year soon , than Beyoncé 's headlining set " . Her performance garnered 458,000 simultaneous viewers on YouTube to become the festival 's most viewed performance to date , and the entire festival had 41 million total viewers , making it the most livestreamed event ever

		CONTEXT=No official live footage of the band was filmed during this tour . In an interview Page gave to '' The Times '' newspaper in 2010 , when asked which performances from Led Zeppelin 's career stand out to him now , he made reference to the tour but acknowledged the lack of visual recordings : This was the first tour in which Led Zeppelin used songs from their upcoming album '' Houses of the Holy '' ( " Over the Hills and Far Away " , " Dancing Days " , and " The Ocean " ) . This was also the last concert tour on which Led Zeppelin included an acoustic section until it was revived in 1975 for their Earls Court performances . John Bonham sang co-lead vocals with Robert Plant during the song Bron-Y-Aur Stomp . The decision to drop the acoustic set was perhaps made because their live concerts were regularly extending into three hour long marathons ( and sometimes up to four and a half hours ) , which were becoming taxing on all four band members

		GOLD_MENTION=US tour in August
		CONTEXT=The publication in the US of Lennon 's remarks about the Beatles being " more popular than Jesus " then embroiled the band in controversy and protest in America 's Bible Belt . A public apology eased tensions , but a US tour in August that was marked by reduced ticket sales , relative to the group 's record attendances in 1965 , and subpar performances proved to be their last . The author Nicholas Schaffner writes : On the Beatles ' return to England , rumours began to circulate that they had decided to break up . George Harrison informed Epstein that he was leaving the band , but was persuaded to stay on the assurance that there would be no more tours . The group took a three-month break , during which they focused on individual interests . Harrison travelled to India for six weeks to study the sitar under the instruction of Ravi Shankar and develop his interest in Hindu philosophy . Having been the last of the Beatles to concede that their live performances had become futile , Paul McCartney collaborated with Beatles producer George Martin on the soundtrack for the film '' The Family Way '' and holidayed in Kenya with Mal Evans , one of the Beatles ' tour managers . Lennon acted in the film '' How I Won the War '' and attended art showings , such as one at the Indica Gallery where he met his future wife Yoko Ono . Ringo Starr used the break to spend time with his wife Maureen and son Zak

Knight soon became the band 's manager , as well as naming the band as a play on words for the Grand Trunk Western Railroad , a well-known rail line in Michigan . First achieving recognition at the 1969 Atlanta International Pop Festival I , the band was signed by Capitol Records . After a raucous , well-received set on the first day of the festival , the group was asked back to play at the 1970 Atlanta International Pop Festival II the following year . Patterned after hard-rock power trios such as Cream , the band , with Terry Knight 's marketing savvy , developed its own popular style . In August 1969 , the band released its first album titled '' On Time '' , which sold over one million copies , and was awarded a gold record in 1970

The tour would be the first in North America by a former Beatle since the group 's 1966 US visit , and Harrison 's first live performances since his staging of the Concert for Bangladesh in August 1971 . Rather than include Beatles material on the 1974 tour , however , Harrison planned to present a varied program combining rock , soul/R & B , jazz , funk and Indian classical music . '' Eight Arms to Hold You '' authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter suggest that " Hari 's on Tour ( Express ) " was written " simply as a show opener " for the North American concerts , which would also feature Harrison 's former Apple Records protégé Billy Preston

		GOLD_MENTION=2010 AFL Rising Star
		CONTEXT=He arrived at the club as an incredibly shy and underdeveloped personality , a fact that was noted by teammate Trent Cotchin who said though Martin was 18 “ he seemed much younger in some of the ways he behaved . ” Indeed , he struggled initially to adjust to the expectations of professional football . In one incident in the 2010 preseason he was removed from training and verbally reprimanded by club leadership when he was deemed unfit to train after a big night out . Despite these struggles , his on-field development was such that he would still debut in the 2010 season 's opening match , a 56-point Richmond loss against at the MCG . Martin recorded the sixth most disposals of any Tiger ( 18 ) to go along with four marks , three tackles and three clearances . Two weeks later Martin was convicted by the AFL tribunal for a high hit on Sydney 's Josh Kennedy in round 3 . He did not receive a suspension for the incident however , returning to football the following week . After four matches Martin ranked fourth in the league for clearances and eighth for hard-ball gets . Media reports emerged after round 8 that the 18 year old Martin had received a significant contract offer from expansion club the Greater Western Sydney Giants . The offer , which the Herald Sun ’s Mark Robinson claimed to be worth $ 2.4 million over three seasons , would have taken effect in the new club 's first AFL season in 2012 . Martin later said he had never entertained the idea of moving to the start-up club . In round 10 he had gained attention for his on-field efforts again , this time being nominated for the 2010 AFL Rising Star award after a 21 disposal and 11 clearance match against Port Adelaide . Due to his previous tribunal conviction however , Martin was ruled ineligible for the award and thus did not officially place in the end of season award 's points tally . He drew the attention of Sydney coach Paul Roos by round 14 , prompting Roos to send veteran Brett Kirk onto Martin in a tagging role . Despite this extra attention , he still managed to record 18 disposals and a goal in the match at the MCG . After 17 rounds Martin ranked second at the club for clearances and inside 50s as well as third for disposals and contested possessions . At the same time he ranked first among that season 's Rising Star nominees in clearances , contested possessions and inside 50s . He was also fourth for average disposals and fifth for average tackles . In round 19 he was rested by the club before returning to play out the final five matches of the season . He missed just that one game in his debut season and finished the year ranked second at Richmond for clearances and inside 50s , as well as third for both contested possessions and disposals . In addition to winning the Fred Swift Medal for fourth place at the club 's best and fairest night , Martin also received six votes in the Brownlow Medal count that year , the most by any Richmond debutant since Craig Lambert in 1988 . At season 's end he reiterated his commitment to the club ( and rejection of the former GWS overtures ) by signing a two-year contract extension that would keep him at Richmond until the end of the 2013 season . The extension was reported by the Herald Sun to be in the vicinity of $ 400,000-a-year

		GOLD_MENTION=VMAs
		CONTEXT=After the commercial lackluster of her eighth studio album , '' Britney Jean '' ( 2013 ) , Spears started her Las Vegas residency show , Britney : Piece of Me , which attained commercial success . Later , in September 2014 , Spears posted a picture of herself in the studio , hinting that she was recording new music . In another interview , a month later , she revealed that she was working " very slowly , but progressively " on the album . In 2015 , she released the song " Pretty Girls " with Iggy Azalea , however the song was met with moderate impact and Spears headed back to the studio to record more songs , but did n't have plans to release a new album . In November 2015 , Spears teased on her Instagram account that she was working with songwriters Justin Tranter and Julia Michaels , by posting a picture of them looking " bemused " with the caption : " Working hard and hardly working ... new album ... wheeeee ! . " A month later , Tranter gave an interview for website NewNowNext about his work with Spears and commented : " Working with Britney is a fucking dream . She is so sweet , so inspiring and a master on the mic . Me and Julia had to leave the studio one day because our screams of excitement after every take she did were distracting the producers . " In late 2016 , during interviews to promote the album , Spears declared that she wanted to explore new things on the record , and that it was her " most hip-hop album , " explaining : " ... there are like two or three songs that go in the direction of more urban that I 've wanted to do for a long time now , and I just have n't really done that . " In May 2016 , in an exclusive interview for website '' Breathe Heavy '' , Tranter revealed : " Nobody ever talks about Britney as a writer and she ’s f " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " was written by Mattias Larsson , Robin Fredriksson , Julia Michaels , Justin Tranter and Sandy Chila , with production being done by Mattman & Robin . Mattman & Robin were also responsible for programming , drums , percussion , snaps , handclaps , synths , guitars , bass and kalimba , while Michaels and Jermaine Jackson provided background vocals . It was recorded at 158 Studios , Westlake Village , California , The Studio at the Palms , Las Vegas , Nevada , and at Wolf Cousins Studios , Stockholm , Sweden . " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is an electropop , and dance-pop song that lasts for three minutes and twenty-two seconds ( 3:22 ) . It features " subtle keyboards , a strummed guitar , " and " wobbly bass " in its instrumentation . For Brian Josephs of '' Spin '' , the song 's guitar slaps " recall her 2001 single ' I 'm a Slave 4 U. ' " Other critics also felt that the " strummed flamenco guitar " on the song is similar to those on Justin Timberlake 's " Like I Love You " . Bianca Gracie of '' Fuse '' opined that the song reminded her of " the glory days ( no pun intended ) of ' Circus ' and ' Femme Fatale ' . " Lyrically , " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is a flirty song about Spears " offer ing several reasons why her lover should come over and options , which can be seen in the lines " Nobody should be alone if they do n't have to be " and " I could get into that kissin ' and touchin ' / Or we could be good and do next to nothin ' . " Amy Roberts of '' Bustle '' noted that the lyrics are about hooking up , adding that they " celebrate the idea that casual relationships do n't need to be lacking respect or understanding . You do n't have to be in love with , or committing to , the person that you 're hooking up with , but that also does n't mean that you ca n't connect with them on a different level than just sex . In fact , Spears makes it clear that it 's kind of even cool if her hook-up does n't want to have sex . Her partner can draw the boundaries of where the massage she 's offering starts and ends , and if it remains as nothing more than a back rub then so be it – that 's totally cool . " For Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine , the song features " some dubious lyrics that seem to suggest masturbatory self-love " in the lines : " All I want is what you want/And all you want is me . " The chorus of the song features " a shouted gang " of backup singers , singing : " Whatever you want / whatever you need / I 'll do it ! . " Lewis Corner of Digital Spy called it " a thumping pop anthem , " praising " Britney 's seductive vocal delivery . " Gil Kaufman of '' Billboard '' named it a " fun , flirty " track . Bianca Gracie of '' Fuse '' described it as a " pulsating track that is a flirty booty call that is bound to own the dance floor . " Robbie Daw of Idolator found it to be " a traditional Spears-style chunk of dance-pop " and " arguably the best yet , with its thick whomping bass and that sparkling ' nobody should be alone if they do n't have to be ' breakdown . " Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine called it " impeccably produced downstairs music , " adding that it " is an irresistible slice of dance-pop , with an ebullient bassline and staccato acoustic guitar . " Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic declared that " some of the highlights on the album are the silliest songs , " citing " Do You Wan na Come Over " 's " overheated flamenco chorus " as an example . Maura Johnston of '' Boston Globe '' said the song was one of the album 's high points , noting that the song " is jolted to life by the slashed guitars that helped make ' Toxic ' a pop thrill . " John Murphy of musicOMH was positive while noting that the track " has a rush and urgency about it which marks it out as one of the album 's best songs . " Nolan Feeney of '' Entertainment Weekly '' also picked it as a highlight , praising the " acoustic guitars and gurgling bass lines that make for one freaky pop experiment . " Alex Macpherson of '' The Guardian '' wrote that the song " takes the party back to Britney 's heyday , " praising the inclusion of the flamenco guitar . For '' Los Angeles Times '' writer Mikael Wood , the song " restore s some of the sonic invention that once defined Spears ' biggest hits . " Nick Levine , writing for '' NME '' , echoed the same thought , writing : " The lusty strut of ‘ Do You Wan na Come Over ? ’ nods to her early-noughties Neptunes-produced hits . " In his Vice column , Robert Christgau selected " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " and " Clumsy " as his favorite tracks on the album . Amy Mackelden of '' Bustle '' elaborated about the track : With a strong '90s vibe , an upbeat tempo , and a surprising rhythm , " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " utilizes the best of Spears ' talents . ... " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " embraces the current trend for songs that are musically complicated , that layer up their beats and sound effects , and feature multiple voices and infectious shouting during their choruses . Much like Hailee Steinfeld and Gwen Stefani 's latest offerings , " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is melodic , has a fast tempo , and is instantly recognizable . And most importantly , it 's fun . On August 18 , 2016 , Spears added " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " , as well as " Make Me ... " , to the setlist of her Las Vegas residency show Britney : Piece of Me . Later , on September 1 , 2016 , a performance of the song was broadcast from Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas for Today . During the performance , she used " an outfit similar to her risqué costume from 2016 's VMAs , while her backup dancers stood out in brightly-colored tank tops and shorts , " as reported by '' Entertainment Weekly '' Ruth Kinane . The song was also included in Spears 's setlist for the iHeartRadio Music Festival on September 24 , 2016 . Spears also performed it at I Heart Radio Jingle Ball , Triple Show and B26 Pepsi Jingle Bash during December 2016 . Also performed it at Apple Music Festival which was held in United Kingdom

" Blake Hannon praised Cyrus ' vocal delivery , writing , " The crowd kept going when things slowed down for Wrecking Ball . It was the highlight of the night , and not because of anything visual .

		ANSWER=Louder '' is missing the visceral oomph
		GOLD_MENTION=2014 World Music Awards
		CONTEXT=The album received mixed reviews from music critics . According to review aggregator Metacritic , the album has a score of 48/100 based on 8 reviews , indicating " mixed or average reviews " . On another aggregator website , Album of the Year , it holds the 4th position on a list of worst reviewed albums of 2014 . Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic gave the album 2.5 stars out of 5 saying that " Michele is not a natural pop star . This was true in 2009 when she debuted on '' Glee '' as Rachel Berry and it 's even clearer in 2014 . " Mike Ayers from '' Billboard '' gave a mostly positive review , saying , " Lyrically , '' Louder '' is rather one-sided , as she often sings about the perils of relationships , over and over , in ways that we 've all heard many times at this point . Still , it 's a solid effort that shows she has promise as a bonafide pop artist . " Sarah Rodman of '' The Boston Globe '' gave the album a mostly positive review , writing , " The Broadway veteran puts her mighty soprano through its paces on bouncy dance tracks , soaring ballads , and midtempo pop tunes where she straddles the line , mostly comfortably , between Katy Perry and Celine Dion . " Kyle Anderson of '' Entertainment Weekly '' gave the album a B - , writing , " It 's hard to be that mad at '' Louder '' , because it 's so admirably and lovingly crafted . There 's nothing wrong with Lea Michele 's debut , and that 's its biggest problem . While well curated and exquisitely executed , '' Louder '' is missing the visceral oomph that defines the gulf between superstars and the rest of the top 40 chum . " At '' USA Today '' , Jerry Shriver rated the album 2.5 stars out of four , and stated that " softer would have been a better approach . " He added that the song " Battlefield " points to a more promising direction . Kevin McFarland of '' The A.V. Club '' gave a C - rating , writing , " '' Louder '' , Michele 's debut solo album under her own name , does feature her distinctive talent as a vocalist . But the record is caught in an unfortunate stylistic limbo between fun-loving , youthful pop and the maturity of adult contemporary artists . " Jim Farber of the '' New York Daily News '' awarded the album two stars . He criticized , " Michele does n't so much sing as trumpet like an elephant eager for the charge . Her voice has more need than vulnerability , more anger than understanding . " Christopher R. Weingarten of '' Rolling Stone '' also gave a negative review , stating , " This album of insta-dated EDM-pop anthems and half-cocked bass drops probably wo n't help Michele 's cause . The songs about love 's ups and downs have a few memorable lyrics ( ' My heart 's too drunk to drive ' ) but not nearly enough . " '' Louder '' was nominated for World 's Best Album at the 2014 World Music Awards , held in Monaco on May 27 , 2014

In November 2015 , Spears teased on her Instagram account that she was working with songwriters Justin Tranter and Julia Michaels , by posting a picture of them looking " bemused " with the caption : " Working hard and hardly working ... new album ... wheeeee ! . " A month later , Tranter gave an interview for website NewNowNext about his work with Spears and commented : " Working with Britney is a fucking dream . She is so sweet , so inspiring and a master on the mic . Me and Julia had to leave the studio one day because our screams of excitement after every take she did were distracting the producers . " In late 2016 , during interviews to promote the album , Spears declared that she wanted to explore new things on the record , and that it was her " most hip-hop album , " explaining : " ... there are like two or three songs that go in the direction of more urban that I 've wanted to do for a long time now , and I just have n't really done that . " In May 2016 , in an exclusive interview for website '' Breathe Heavy '' , Tranter revealed : " Nobody ever talks about Britney as a writer and she ’s f " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " was written by Mattias Larsson , Robin Fredriksson , Julia Michaels , Justin Tranter and Sandy Chila , with production being done by Mattman & Robin . Mattman & Robin were also responsible for programming , drums , percussion , snaps , handclaps , synths , guitars , bass and kalimba , while Michaels and Jermaine Jackson provided background vocals . It was recorded at 158 Studios , Westlake Village , California , The Studio at the Palms , Las Vegas , Nevada , and at Wolf Cousins Studios , Stockholm , Sweden . " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is an electropop , and dance-pop song that lasts for three minutes and twenty-two seconds ( 3:22 ) . It features " subtle keyboards , a strummed guitar , " and " wobbly bass " in its instrumentation . For Brian Josephs of '' Spin '' , the song 's guitar slaps " recall her 2001 single ' I 'm a Slave 4 U. ' " Other critics also felt that the " strummed flamenco guitar " on the song is similar to those on Justin Timberlake 's " Like I Love You " . Bianca Gracie of '' Fuse '' opined that the song reminded her of " the glory days ( no pun intended ) of ' Circus ' and ' Femme Fatale ' . " Lyrically , " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is a flirty song about Spears " offer ing several reasons why her lover should come over and options , which can be seen in the lines " Nobody should be alone if they do n't have to be " and " I could get into that kissin ' and touchin ' / Or we could be good and do next to nothin ' . " Amy Roberts of '' Bustle '' noted that the lyrics are about hooking up , adding that they " celebrate the idea that casual relationships do n't need to be lacking respect or understanding . You do n't have to be in love with , or committing to , the person that you 're hooking up with , but that also does n't mean that you ca n't connect with them on a different level than just sex . In fact , Spears makes it clear that it 's kind of even cool if her hook-up does n't want to have sex . Her partner can draw the boundaries of where the massage she 's offering starts and ends , and if it remains as nothing more than a back rub then so be it – that 's totally cool . " For Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine , the song features " some dubious lyrics that seem to suggest masturbatory self-love " in the lines : " All I want is what you want/And all you want is me . " The chorus of the song features " a shouted gang " of backup singers , singing : " Whatever you want / whatever you need / I 'll do it ! . " Lewis Corner of Digital Spy called it " a thumping pop anthem , " praising " Britney 's seductive vocal delivery . " Gil Kaufman of '' Billboard '' named it a " fun , flirty " track . Bianca Gracie of '' Fuse '' described it as a " pulsating track that is a flirty booty call that is bound to own the dance floor . " Robbie Daw of Idolator found it to be " a traditional Spears-style chunk of dance-pop " and " arguably the best yet , with its thick whomping bass and that sparkling ' nobody should be alone if they do n't have to be ' breakdown . " Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine called it " impeccably produced downstairs music , " adding that it " is an irresistible slice of dance-pop , with an ebullient bassline and staccato acoustic guitar . " Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic declared that " some of the highlights on the album are the silliest songs , " citing " Do You Wan na Come Over " 's " overheated flamenco chorus " as an example . Maura Johnston of '' Boston Globe '' said the song was one of the album 's high points , noting that the song " is jolted to life by the slashed guitars that helped make ' Toxic ' a pop thrill . " John Murphy of musicOMH was positive while noting that the track " has a rush and urgency about it which marks it out as one of the album 's best songs . " Nolan Feeney of '' Entertainment Weekly '' also picked it as a highlight , praising the " acoustic guitars and gurgling bass lines that make for one freaky pop experiment . " Alex Macpherson of '' The Guardian '' wrote that the song " takes the party back to Britney 's heyday , " praising the inclusion of the flamenco guitar . For '' Los Angeles Times '' writer Mikael Wood , the song " restore s some of the sonic invention that once defined Spears ' biggest hits . " Nick Levine , writing for '' NME '' , echoed the same thought , writing : " The lusty strut of ‘ Do You Wan na Come Over ? ’ nods to her early-noughties Neptunes-produced hits . " In his Vice column , Robert Christgau selected " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " and " Clumsy " as his favorite tracks on the album . Amy Mackelden of '' Bustle '' elaborated about the track : With a strong '90s vibe , an upbeat tempo , and a surprising rhythm , " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " utilizes the best of Spears ' talents . ... " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " embraces the current trend for songs that are musically complicated , that layer up their beats and sound effects , and feature multiple voices and infectious shouting during their choruses . Much like Hailee Steinfeld and Gwen Stefani 's latest offerings , " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is melodic , has a fast tempo , and is instantly recognizable . And most importantly , it 's fun . On August 18 , 2016 , Spears added " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " , as well as " Make Me ... " , to the setlist of her Las Vegas residency show Britney : Piece of Me . Later , on September 1 , 2016 , a performance of the song was broadcast from Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas for Today . During the performance , she used " an outfit similar to her risqué costume from 2016 's VMAs , while her backup dancers stood out in brightly-colored tank tops and shorts , " as reported by '' Entertainment Weekly '' Ruth Kinane . The song was also included in Spears 's setlist for the iHeartRadio Music Festival on September 24 , 2016 . Spears also performed it at I Heart Radio Jingle Ball , Triple Show and B26 Pepsi Jingle Bash during December 2016 . Also performed it at Apple Music Festival which was held in United Kingdom

Therefore , Gandin decided to let his soldiers vote on 13 September 1943 as to what to do to next . The troops voted overwhelmingly to fight their former allies the Germans , thus the '' Acqui '' became one of the very few Italian units to actively resist the Germans . The Germans therefore summarily executed over half of the divisions soldiers and all of its officers in revenge during the Massacre of the Acqui Division

" The book was partially printed in the Soviet Union by the Yiddish publisher '' Der Emes '' , however the entire edition , the typefaces , as well as the manuscript , were destroyed . First the censors ordered changes in the text to conceal the specifically anti-Jewish character of the atrocities and to downplay the role of some Ukrainians who worked as Nazi police officers . In 1948 the Soviet edition of the book was scrapped completely . The collection of original documents that Ehrenburg handed down to the Vilnius Jewish Museum after the war was secretly returned to him upon the Museum 's termination in 1948 .

		ANSWER=collectivist thinking
		GOLD_MENTION=Stalinist terror
		CONTEXT=The crux of Nolte 's thesis was presented when he wrote : " It is a notable shortcoming of the literature about National Socialism that it does not know or does not want to admit to what degree all the deeds — with the sole exception of the technical process of gassing — that the National Socialists later committed had already been described in a voluminous literature of the early 1920s : mass deportations and shootings , torture , death camps , extermination of entire groups using strictly objective selection criteria , and public demands for the annihilation of millions of guiltless people who were thought to be " enemies " . It is probable that many of these reports were exaggerated . It is certain that the “ White Terror ” also committed terrible deeds , even though its program contained no analogy to the “ extermination of the bourgeoisie ” . Nonetheless , the following question must seem permissible , even unavoidable : Did the National Socialists or Hitler perhaps commit an “ Asiatic ” deed merely because they and their ilk considered themselves to be the potential victims of an “ Asiatic ” deed ? Was n’t the ' Gulag Archipelago ' more original than Auschwitz ? Was the Bolshevik murder of an entire class not the logical and factual '' prius '' of the " racial murder " of National Socialism ? Can not Hitler 's most secret deeds be explained by the fact that he had '' not '' forgotten the rat cage ? Did Auschwitz in its root causes not originate in a past that would not pass ? " Nolte wrote the principle problem " for the coming generations ... must be liberation from collectivist thinking " , which Nolte claimed dominated scholarship on Nazi Germany . Nolte ended his essay with calling for a " more comprehensive debate " about the memory of Nazi Germany that would allow for " the past that will not go away " to finally go away " as is suitable for every past " . Nolte subsequently presented a 1940 book by American author Theodore N. Kaufman entitled '' Germany Must Perish ! '' . The text contends that all German men should be sterilized , evidencing , according to Nolte , the alleged " Jewish " desire to " annihilate " Germans prior to the Holocaust . An August 1941 appeal to the world by a group of Soviet Jews seeking support against Germany was also cited by Nolte as evidence of Jewish determination to thwart the '' Reich '' . Nolte argued that the Nazis felt forced to undertake the Holocaust by Hitler 's conclusion that the entire Jewish population of the world had declared war on Germany . From Nolte 's point of view , the Holocaust was an act of “ Asiatic barbarism ” forced on the Germans by the fear of what Joseph Stalin , whom Nolte believed to have significant Jewish support , might do to them . Nolte contends that the U.S. internment of Japanese Americans in the wake of the Pearl Harbor attack provides a parallel to the German " internment " of the Jewish population of Europe in concentration camps , in light of what Nolte alleges was the " Jewish " declaration of war on Germany in 1939 which Weizmann 's letter allegedly constitutes . Subsequently , Nolte expanded upon these views in his 1987 book '' Der europäische Bürgerkrieg , 1917 – 1945 '' ( '' The European Civil War , 1917 – 1945 '' ) in which he claimed that the entire 20th century was an age of genocide , totalitarianism , and tyranny , and that the Holocaust had been merely one chapter in the age of violence , terror and population displacement . Nolte claimed that this age had started with the genocide of the Armenians during World War I , and also included the Stalinist terror in the Soviet Union , the expulsion of ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe , Maoist terror in China as manifested in such events as the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution , compulsory population exchanges between Greece and Turkey from 1922 to 1923 , American war crimes in the Vietnam War , the Khmer Rouge genocide in Cambodia , and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan . In particular , Nolte argued that the expulsion of ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe in 1945 – 46 was " to be categorized ... under the concept of genocide " . As part of this argument , Nolte cited the 1979 book of the American historian Alfred-Maurice de Zayas , '' Die Wehrmacht Untersuchungsstelle '' , which argues that the Allies were just as guilty of war crimes as the Germans as the " happy evidence of the will to objectivity on the part of a foreigner " In Nolte 's opinion , Hitler was a " European citizen " who fought in defence of the values of the West against " Asiatic " Bolshevism , but due to his " total egocentrism " waged this struggle with unnecessary violence and brutality Since in Nolte 's view , the '' Shoah '' was not a unique crime , there is no reason to single out Germans for special criticism for the Holocaust . In addition , Nolte sees his work as the beginning of a much-needed revisionist treatment to end the " negative myth " of the Third Reich that dominates contemporary perceptions . Nolte took the view that the principle problem of German history was this “ negative myth ” of the Third Reich , which cast the Nazi era as the '' ne plus ultra '' of evil . Nolte wrote that after the American Civil War , the defeated South was cast as the symbol of total evil by the victorious North , but later “ revisionism ” became the dominant historical interpretation against the “ negative myth ” of the South , which led to a more balanced history of the Civil War with a greater understanding of the “ motives and way of life of the defeated Southern states ” , and led to the leaders of the Confederacy becoming great American heroes . Nolte urged that a similar “ revisionism ” destroy the “ negative myth ” of the Third Reich . Nolte argued that the Vietnam War , the Khmer Rouge genocide , the expulsion of " boat people " from Vietnam , the Islamic revolution in Iran , and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan meant the traditional picture of Nazi Germany as the ultimate in evil was no longer tenable , and proved the need for " revisionism " to put an end to the " negative myth " of the Third Reich . In Nolte 's view , the first efforts at revisionism of the Nazi period failed because A. J. P. Taylor 's 1961 book '' The Origins of the Second World War '' was only a part of the " anti-German literature of indictment " while David Hoggan in '' Der erzwugnene Krieg '' , by only seeking to examine why World War II broke out in 1939 , " cut himself off from the really decisive questions " . Then the next revisionist efforts Nolte cites were the Italian historian Domenico Settembrini 's favorable treatment of Fascism for saving Italy from Communism , and the British historian Timothy Mason 's studies in working class German history . The best of the revisionists according to Nolte is David Irving , with whom Nolte finds some fault , although " not all of Irving 's theses and points can be dismissed with such ease " . Nolte praises Irving as the first to understand that Weizmann 's letter to Chamberlain was a " Jewish declaration of war " on Germany that justified the " interning " of the Jews of Europe . Nolte went on to praise Irving for putting the Holocaust " in a more comprehensive perspective " by comparing it to the British fire-bombing of Hamburg in 1943 , which Nolte views as just much of an act of genocide as the " Final Solution " . The sort of revisionism needed to end the " negative myth " of the Third Reich is , in Nolte 's opinion , an examination of the impact of the Russian Revolution on Germany

Already since the early summer of 1943 , German troops had been pouring into Greece , fearing an Allied landing there ( in fact falling victims to a grand-scale Allied strategic deception operation , " Operation Barclay " ) . Soon they became involved in wide-ranging counterguerrilla operations , which they carried out with great ruthlessness , based on their experiences in Yugoslavia . In the course of these operations , mass reprisals were carried out , resulting in war crimes such as at Kommeno on August 16 , the Massacre of Kalavryta in December and the Massacre of Distomo in June 1944 .

		ANSWER=Italian police
		GOLD_MENTION=Raid of the Ghetto of Rome
		CONTEXT=Police Order No. 5 did not mark the start of the arrest , deportation and murder of Jews in Italy , which had begun almost immediately after the start of the German occupation in September . In case of the Raid of the Ghetto of Rome on 16 October 1943 , when over 1,000 Jews were arrested to be deported and killed at Auschwitz , the Roman police had not participated and had not been asked to as the Germans considered them to be to unreliable . Up to the issuing of the police order , Italian police had only assisted the Germans in the arrest and persecution of Jews when requested to . From 1 December 1943 it did so on its own accord . The Fascist Italian government also established concentration camps for arrested Jews following the issuing of Police Order No. 5 , like the Fossoli camp , reopened in December 1943 , which was eventually handed over to the Germans in March 1944

		ANSWER=31st Guards Rifle Division
		GOLD_MENTION=
		CONTEXT=The 328th Rifle Division was formed as a standard Red Army rifle division at Yaroslavl late in the summer of 1941 , as part of the massive buildup of new Soviet fighting formations in response to the German invasion . Like several other divisions in the 320 - 330 series , it was neither fully trained nor equipped when thrown into the Soviet winter counteroffensive as part of 10th Army , but did its part in throwing back the forces of German Army Group Center from the southern approaches to Moscow in December and January . Over the course of five months of nearly continual offensive combat the soldiers of the division distinguished themselves sufficiently to be re-designated as the 31st Guards Rifle Division . A few months later a new 328th was formed , this time in the Transcaucasus Military District as the German summer offensive of 1942 was producing a crisis in that region . This new division had a slow start , but eventually proved itself in fighting through Ukraine , Belarus and Poland , gaining a battle honor for the liberation of Warsaw , and helping to complete the encirclement of Berlin in April 1945 . Despite this record , it was disbanded shortly after the German surrender .

		ANSWER=fight their former allies the Germans
		GOLD_MENTION=Massacre of the Acqui Division
		CONTEXT=In May 1943 the division transferred for garrison duties to the Greek island of Cefalonia . After Italy 's surrender to the Allies on 3 September 1943 the divisions commanding general Antonio Gandin was left without clear orders from his superiors . Therefore , Gandin decided to let his soldiers vote on 13 September 1943 as to what to do to next . The troops voted overwhelmingly to fight their former allies the Germans , thus the '' Acqui '' became one of the very few Italian units to actively resist the Germans . The Germans therefore summarily executed over half of the divisions soldiers and all of its officers in revenge during the Massacre of the Acqui Division

		ANSWER=pri
		GOLD_MENTION=Stalinist terror
		CONTEXT=The crux of Nolte 's thesis was presented when he wrote : " It is a notable shortcoming of the literature about National Socialism that it does not know or does not want to admit to what degree all the deeds — with the sole exception of the technical process of gassing — that the National Socialists later committed had already been described in a voluminous literature of the early 1920s : mass deportations and shootings , torture , death camps , extermination of entire groups using strictly objective selection criteria , and public demands for the annihilation of millions of guiltless people who were thought to be " enemies " . It is probable that many of these reports were exaggerated . It is certain that the “ White Terror ” also committed terrible deeds , even though its program contained no analogy to the “ extermination of the bourgeoisie ” . Nonetheless , the following question must seem permissible , even unavoidable : Did the National Socialists or Hitler perhaps commit an “ Asiatic ” deed merely because they and their ilk considered themselves to be the potential victims of an “ Asiatic ” deed ? Was n’t the ' Gulag Archipelago ' more original than Auschwitz ? Was the Bolshevik murder of an entire class not the logical and factual '' prius '' of the " racial murder " of National Socialism ? Can not Hitler 's most secret deeds be explained by the fact that he had '' not '' forgotten the rat cage ? Did Auschwitz in its root causes not originate in a past that would not pass ? " Nolte wrote the principle problem " for the coming generations ... must be liberation from collectivist thinking " , which Nolte claimed dominated scholarship on Nazi Germany . Nolte ended his essay with calling for a " more comprehensive debate " about the memory of Nazi Germany that would allow for " the past that will not go away " to finally go away " as is suitable for every past " . Nolte subsequently presented a 1940 book by American author Theodore N. Kaufman entitled '' Germany Must Perish ! '' . The text contends that all German men should be sterilized , evidencing , according to Nolte , the alleged " Jewish " desire to " annihilate " Germans prior to the Holocaust . An August 1941 appeal to the world by a group of Soviet Jews seeking support against Germany was also cited by Nolte as evidence of Jewish determination to thwart the '' Reich '' . Nolte argued that the Nazis felt forced to undertake the Holocaust by Hitler 's conclusion that the entire Jewish population of the world had declared war on Germany . From Nolte 's point of view , the Holocaust was an act of “ Asiatic barbarism ” forced on the Germans by the fear of what Joseph Stalin , whom Nolte believed to have significant Jewish support , might do to them . Nolte contends that the U.S. internment of Japanese Americans in the wake of the Pearl Harbor attack provides a parallel to the German " internment " of the Jewish population of Europe in concentration camps , in light of what Nolte alleges was the " Jewish " declaration of war on Germany in 1939 which Weizmann 's letter allegedly constitutes . Subsequently , Nolte expanded upon these views in his 1987 book '' Der europäische Bürgerkrieg , 1917 – 1945 '' ( '' The European Civil War , 1917 – 1945 '' ) in which he claimed that the entire 20th century was an age of genocide , totalitarianism , and tyranny , and that the Holocaust had been merely one chapter in the age of violence , terror and population displacement . Nolte claimed that this age had started with the genocide of the Armenians during World War I , and also included the Stalinist terror in the Soviet Union , the expulsion of ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe , Maoist terror in China as manifested in such events as the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution , compulsory population exchanges between Greece and Turkey from 1922 to 1923 , American war crimes in the Vietnam War , the Khmer Rouge genocide in Cambodia , and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan . In particular , Nolte argued that the expulsion of ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe in 1945 – 46 was " to be categorized ... under the concept of genocide " . As part of this argument , Nolte cited the 1979 book of the American historian Alfred-Maurice de Zayas , '' Die Wehrmacht Untersuchungsstelle '' , which argues that the Allies were just as guilty of war crimes as the Germans as the " happy evidence of the will to objectivity on the part of a foreigner " In Nolte 's opinion , Hitler was a " European citizen " who fought in defence of the values of the West against " Asiatic " Bolshevism , but due to his " total egocentrism " waged this struggle with unnecessary violence and brutality Since in Nolte 's view , the '' Shoah '' was not a unique crime , there is no reason to single out Germans for special criticism for the Holocaust . In addition , Nolte sees his work as the beginning of a much-needed revisionist treatment to end the " negative myth " of the Third Reich that dominates contemporary perceptions . Nolte took the view that the principle problem of German history was this “ negative myth ” of the Third Reich , which cast the Nazi era as the '' ne plus ultra '' of evil . Nolte wrote that after the American Civil War , the defeated South was cast as the symbol of total evil by the victorious North , but later “ revisionism ” became the dominant historical interpretation against the “ negative myth ” of the South , which led to a more balanced history of the Civil War with a greater understanding of the “ motives and way of life of the defeated Southern states ” , and led to the leaders of the Confederacy becoming great American heroes . Nolte urged that a similar “ revisionism ” destroy the “ negative myth ” of the Third Reich . Nolte argued that the Vietnam War , the Khmer Rouge genocide , the expulsion of " boat people " from Vietnam , the Islamic revolution in Iran , and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan meant the traditional picture of Nazi Germany as the ultimate in evil was no longer tenable , and proved the need for " revisionism " to put an end to the " negative myth " of the Third Reich . In Nolte 's view , the first efforts at revisionism of the Nazi period failed because A. J. P. Taylor 's 1961 book '' The Origins of the Second World War '' was only a part of the " anti-German literature of indictment " while David Hoggan in '' Der erzwugnene Krieg '' , by only seeking to examine why World War II broke out in 1939 , " cut himself off from the really decisive questions " . Then the next revisionist efforts Nolte cites were the Italian historian Domenico Settembrini 's favorable treatment of Fascism for saving Italy from Communism , and the British historian Timothy Mason 's studies in working class German history . The best of the revisionists according to Nolte is David Irving , with whom Nolte finds some fault , although " not all of Irving 's theses and points can be dismissed with such ease " . Nolte praises Irving as the first to understand that Weizmann 's letter to Chamberlain was a " Jewish declaration of war " on Germany that justified the " interning " of the Jews of Europe . Nolte went on to praise Irving for putting the Holocaust " in a more comprehensive perspective " by comparing it to the British fire-bombing of Hamburg in 1943 , which Nolte views as just much of an act of genocide as the " Final Solution " . The sort of revisionism needed to end the " negative myth " of the Third Reich is , in Nolte 's opinion , an examination of the impact of the Russian Revolution on Germany

But its charm never quite wears off , for reasons summed up in the title . " Actress Angourie Rice had similar sentiments , writing in an essay that “ it was such a fascinating experience to witness the actors ’ performances turned into van Gogh style paintings . The great thing about this film is that it also made me question what the merging of artforms meant for art , film , and everything in between . ” Giuseppe Sedia of the '' Krakow Post '' praised the impressive visual style of the movie . However , he added , " In their concern to keep the viewers interested , directors Kobiela and Welchman have built an over-narrated and spirit-dampening movie in which the preponderance of the dialogues hinders the viewers ’ immersion into the violent beauty and materiality of Van Gogh ’s oeuvre " . The film won the " Most Popular International Feature " award at the 2017 Vancouver International Film Festival .

		GOLD_MENTION=1992 Eurovision Song Contest
		CONTEXT=Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny appears at his back door in his boxers and invites viewers for a look around his house ; including a ( now fully dressed ) encounter with his karaoke machine . He then sets off on his bicycle for an interview at RTÉ . Alas his attempts to get there unscathed come undone when his bike receives a puncture and he has to resort to queueing for a bus like the common person . When the bus arrives , he realises he has no money but after asking for some spare cash from an innocent bystander , he turns around to find the bus has pulled off again . In the RTÉ carpark , Pat Kenny sits in his car , casting his eyes over his fellow broadcasters and enviously longing to join them in their casual conversation . When he finally plucks up the courage to approach Marian Finucane and Joe Duffy , the latter is overheard insulting him and Pat heads back to his car . With Pat due on air in ten minutes , Tom decides to join him in the passenger seat but he must first overcome the clutches of George Hook , who once again attempts to lure him to Newstalk . Pat asks Tom what the world really thinks of him , believing that his assistant is the only person in the world who is loyal to him . Tom attempts to avoid the question , distracting Pat by ( wrongly ) telling him that Enda Kenny has just arrived . Eventually Tom opts to tell Pat , albeit with much hesitation , that he is '' " absolutely unbelievable " '' . At that moment Enda Kenny finally arrives at the studio , still in his biker gear and collapses with exhaustion on the steps having raced through Dublin to make the interview on schedule . Kenny and Kenny square off on air and , with Pat faced with an adversary so similar in perceived personality , popularity and name he is even more unable to cope with his feelings of unworthiness than usual . Pat breaks down live on air , mistaking Enda 's rival , Taoiseach Bertie Ahern , for his own rival , '' Liveline '' presenter Joe Duffy . This prompts Enda to join him in his moment of unrelenting emotion . The next morning Tom arrives at Pat 's house . Pat assumes he has come with his P45 or details of who is to take over the mantle of the station 's highest earning broadcaster . However Tom merely points to two giant sacks of complimentary mail he has carried on his bike from RTÉ headquarters . One of them even wants to sleep with the presenter , who quickly places the letter in the left front pocket of his dressing gown . Pat is astounded to discover he is all over the news and that celebrities such as 1992 Eurovision Song Contest winner Linda Martin , music mogul Louis Walsh and Boyzone lead singer Ronan Keating are talking about him . He hurries indoors to switch on his television . There he finds that figures from the worlds of sport and politics including Irish national football team manager Steve Staunton , Ireland rugby manager Eddie O'Sullivan and Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams are lining up in their droves to pay tribute to him . He is intrigued to find Fintan O'Toole has also spoken greatly of him but becomes irritated when he finds that Steve Staunton seems to have taken over the airwaves , typically reiterating how Pat has done a great job , how he works for the team , has delivered a great result and what else can you say . Meanwhile , Bertie Ahern repeatedly rings Tom 's mobile to request an interview with Pat , but on each occasion Tom tells him to ring back later . Pat and Tom stroll into RTÉ , where George Hook is astounded to hear of Pat 's newfound popularity . He is adamant that Tom will soon join him at Newstalk but Tom shows his unswaying loyalty by declaring he will go only where Pat goes . On Friday night George slips into RTÉ and just as an episode of '' The Late Late Show '' is coming to a close , approaches Pat 's dressing room . George is inadvertently knocked to the floor by a stray microphone where he lies moaning until Pat emerges from the dressing room . Pat steps over George and leaves RTÉ with Tom , telling his assistant that he should not allow anyone to undermine him before demanding that he open the door

		CONTEXT=The ceremony was held on a night other than Sunday for the first time since 1976 ( the 28th Primetime Emmy Awards were also staged on a Monday that year , May 17 ) . The ceremony 's unusual date — a Monday night in late August — was due to two factors , primary being NBC 's commitment to '' Sunday Night Football '' ; since acquiring the National Football League 's Sunday night game package in 2006 , NBC , when it is their turn in the four-network rotation to air the Primetime Emmy Awards , usually schedules the ceremony for the Sunday before Labor Day weekend , to avoid conflicts with '' SNF '' in mid-September ( when ABC , CBS , or Fox normally air the ceremony ) . NBC 's ideal date on the 2014 calendar for the ceremony ( Sunday , August 24 ) led to the other scheduling factor — MTV 's Video Music Awards , which were set for that night more than a year in advance ( and would be staged in the L.A. area as well , at The Forum in Inglewood ) . On January 28 , 2014 , rather than go head-to-head with the VMA 's , NBC announced that the ceremony would take place on Monday , August 25 . The move would allow NBC to commit to a preseason '' Sunday Night Football '' broadcast for the 24th ( a game between the Cincinnati Bengals and Arizona Cardinals ) ; it also ensured the tradition of staging the Primetime Emmy Awards the weekend after the Creative Arts Emmy Awards ( that ceremony was already set for August 16 )

Poe tells Lincoln that the vampires are being chased out of their ancestral homes in Europe ( in part because of a public outcry over the bloody atrocities of Elizabeth Báthory ) and are flocking to America because of the slave trade . Poe warns that if the vampires are left unchecked , they will eventually seek to enslave all Americans , white and black . Lincoln leaves Washington in 1849 and declines to seek re-election ; Poe is found murdered that same year in Baltimore , the victim of a vampire attack . In 1857 , Henry summons Lincoln to New York City . Here , Lincoln and fellow vampire slayer William Seward are told that the vampires in the South intend to start a civil war so that they can conquer the north and enslave all humans of America . Lincoln runs for the U.S. Senate and debates Stephen A. Douglas in what became known as the Lincoln – Douglas debates . Although Lincoln loses to Douglas ( an ally of the Southern vampires ) , he gains a great deal of publicity and respect , which allows him to capture the Republican Party nomination for President of the United States and then the office itself

		GOLD_MENTION=1860 Constitutional Union Convention
		CONTEXT=The 1860 Republican National Convention nominated Lincoln , a moderate former Congressman from Illinois , as its standard-bearer . The Republican Party platform promised not to interfere with slavery in the states , but opposed the further extension of slavery into the territories . The first 1860 Democratic National Convention adjourned without agreeing on a nominee , but a second convention nominated Senator Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois for president . Douglas 's support for the concept of popular sovereignty , which called for each individual territory to decide on the status of slavery , alienated many Southern Democrats . The Southern Democrats , with the support of President Buchanan , held their own convention and nominated Vice President John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky for president . The 1860 Constitutional Union Convention nominated a ticket led by former Senator John Bell of Tennessee

		GOLD_MENTION=2010 AFL Rising Star
		CONTEXT=He arrived at the club as an incredibly shy and underdeveloped personality , a fact that was noted by teammate Trent Cotchin who said though Martin was 18 “ he seemed much younger in some of the ways he behaved . ” Indeed , he struggled initially to adjust to the expectations of professional football . In one incident in the 2010 preseason he was removed from training and verbally reprimanded by club leadership when he was deemed unfit to train after a big night out . Despite these struggles , his on-field development was such that he would still debut in the 2010 season 's opening match , a 56-point Richmond loss against at the MCG . Martin recorded the sixth most disposals of any Tiger ( 18 ) to go along with four marks , three tackles and three clearances . Two weeks later Martin was convicted by the AFL tribunal for a high hit on Sydney 's Josh Kennedy in round 3 . He did not receive a suspension for the incident however , returning to football the following week . After four matches Martin ranked fourth in the league for clearances and eighth for hard-ball gets . Media reports emerged after round 8 that the 18 year old Martin had received a significant contract offer from expansion club the Greater Western Sydney Giants . The offer , which the Herald Sun ’s Mark Robinson claimed to be worth $ 2.4 million over three seasons , would have taken effect in the new club 's first AFL season in 2012 . Martin later said he had never entertained the idea of moving to the start-up club . In round 10 he had gained attention for his on-field efforts again , this time being nominated for the 2010 AFL Rising Star award after a 21 disposal and 11 clearance match against Port Adelaide . Due to his previous tribunal conviction however , Martin was ruled ineligible for the award and thus did not officially place in the end of season award 's points tally . He drew the attention of Sydney coach Paul Roos by round 14 , prompting Roos to send veteran Brett Kirk onto Martin in a tagging role . Despite this extra attention , he still managed to record 18 disposals and a goal in the match at the MCG . After 17 rounds Martin ranked second at the club for clearances and inside 50s as well as third for disposals and contested possessions . At the same time he ranked first among that season 's Rising Star nominees in clearances , contested possessions and inside 50s . He was also fourth for average disposals and fifth for average tackles . In round 19 he was rested by the club before returning to play out the final five matches of the season . He missed just that one game in his debut season and finished the year ranked second at Richmond for clearances and inside 50s , as well as third for both contested possessions and disposals . In addition to winning the Fred Swift Medal for fourth place at the club 's best and fairest night , Martin also received six votes in the Brownlow Medal count that year , the most by any Richmond debutant since Craig Lambert in 1988 . At season 's end he reiterated his commitment to the club ( and rejection of the former GWS overtures ) by signing a two-year contract extension that would keep him at Richmond until the end of the 2013 season . The extension was reported by the Herald Sun to be in the vicinity of $ 400,000-a-year

		GOLD_MENTION=2010 AFL Rising Star
		CONTEXT=He arrived at the club as an incredibly shy and underdeveloped personality , a fact that was noted by teammate Trent Cotchin who said though Martin was 18 “ he seemed much younger in some of the ways he behaved . ” Indeed , he struggled initially to adjust to the expectations of professional football . In one incident in the 2010 preseason he was removed from training and verbally reprimanded by club leadership when he was deemed unfit to train after a big night out . Despite these struggles , his on-field development was such that he would still debut in the 2010 season 's opening match , a 56-point Richmond loss against at the MCG . Martin recorded the sixth most disposals of any Tiger ( 18 ) to go along with four marks , three tackles and three clearances . Two weeks later Martin was convicted by the AFL tribunal for a high hit on Sydney 's Josh Kennedy in round 3 . He did not receive a suspension for the incident however , returning to football the following week . After four matches Martin ranked fourth in the league for clearances and eighth for hard-ball gets . Media reports emerged after round 8 that the 18 year old Martin had received a significant contract offer from expansion club the Greater Western Sydney Giants . The offer , which the Herald Sun ’s Mark Robinson claimed to be worth $ 2.4 million over three seasons , would have taken effect in the new club 's first AFL season in 2012 . Martin later said he had never entertained the idea of moving to the start-up club . In round 10 he had gained attention for his on-field efforts again , this time being nominated for the 2010 AFL Rising Star award after a 21 disposal and 11 clearance match against Port Adelaide . Due to his previous tribunal conviction however , Martin was ruled ineligible for the award and thus did not officially place in the end of season award 's points tally . He drew the attention of Sydney coach Paul Roos by round 14 , prompting Roos to send veteran Brett Kirk onto Martin in a tagging role . Despite this extra attention , he still managed to record 18 disposals and a goal in the match at the MCG . After 17 rounds Martin ranked second at the club for clearances and inside 50s as well as third for disposals and contested possessions . At the same time he ranked first among that season 's Rising Star nominees in clearances , contested possessions and inside 50s . He was also fourth for average disposals and fifth for average tackles . In round 19 he was rested by the club before returning to play out the final five matches of the season . He missed just that one game in his debut season and finished the year ranked second at Richmond for clearances and inside 50s , as well as third for both contested possessions and disposals . In addition to winning the Fred Swift Medal for fourth place at the club 's best and fairest night , Martin also received six votes in the Brownlow Medal count that year , the most by any Richmond debutant since Craig Lambert in 1988 . At season 's end he reiterated his commitment to the club ( and rejection of the former GWS overtures ) by signing a two-year contract extension that would keep him at Richmond until the end of the 2013 season . The extension was reported by the Herald Sun to be in the vicinity of $ 400,000-a-year

		CONTEXT=Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny appears at his back door in his boxers and invites viewers for a look around his house ; including a ( now fully dressed ) encounter with his karaoke machine . He then sets off on his bicycle for an interview at RTÉ . Alas his attempts to get there unscathed come undone when his bike receives a puncture and he has to resort to queueing for a bus like the common person . When the bus arrives , he realises he has no money but after asking for some spare cash from an innocent bystander , he turns around to find the bus has pulled off again . In the RTÉ carpark , Pat Kenny sits in his car , casting his eyes over his fellow broadcasters and enviously longing to join them in their casual conversation . When he finally plucks up the courage to approach Marian Finucane and Joe Duffy , the latter is overheard insulting him and Pat heads back to his car . With Pat due on air in ten minutes , Tom decides to join him in the passenger seat but he must first overcome the clutches of George Hook , who once again attempts to lure him to Newstalk . Pat asks Tom what the world really thinks of him , believing that his assistant is the only person in the world who is loyal to him . Tom attempts to avoid the question , distracting Pat by ( wrongly ) telling him that Enda Kenny has just arrived . Eventually Tom opts to tell Pat , albeit with much hesitation , that he is '' " absolutely unbelievable " '' . At that moment Enda Kenny finally arrives at the studio , still in his biker gear and collapses with exhaustion on the steps having raced through Dublin to make the interview on schedule . Kenny and Kenny square off on air and , with Pat faced with an adversary so similar in perceived personality , popularity and name he is even more unable to cope with his feelings of unworthiness than usual . Pat breaks down live on air , mistaking Enda 's rival , Taoiseach Bertie Ahern , for his own rival , '' Liveline '' presenter Joe Duffy . This prompts Enda to join him in his moment of unrelenting emotion . The next morning Tom arrives at Pat 's house . Pat assumes he has come with his P45 or details of who is to take over the mantle of the station 's highest earning broadcaster . However Tom merely points to two giant sacks of complimentary mail he has carried on his bike from RTÉ headquarters . One of them even wants to sleep with the presenter , who quickly places the letter in the left front pocket of his dressing gown . Pat is astounded to discover he is all over the news and that celebrities such as 1992 Eurovision Song Contest winner Linda Martin , music mogul Louis Walsh and Boyzone lead singer Ronan Keating are talking about him . He hurries indoors to switch on his television . There he finds that figures from the worlds of sport and politics including Irish national football team manager Steve Staunton , Ireland rugby manager Eddie O'Sullivan and Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams are lining up in their droves to pay tribute to him . He is intrigued to find Fintan O'Toole has also spoken greatly of him but becomes irritated when he finds that Steve Staunton seems to have taken over the airwaves , typically reiterating how Pat has done a great job , how he works for the team , has delivered a great result and what else can you say . Meanwhile , Bertie Ahern repeatedly rings Tom 's mobile to request an interview with Pat , but on each occasion Tom tells him to ring back later . Pat and Tom stroll into RTÉ , where George Hook is astounded to hear of Pat 's newfound popularity . He is adamant that Tom will soon join him at Newstalk but Tom shows his unswaying loyalty by declaring he will go only where Pat goes . On Friday night George slips into RTÉ and just as an episode of '' The Late Late Show '' is coming to a close , approaches Pat 's dressing room . George is inadvertently knocked to the floor by a stray microphone where he lies moaning until Pat emerges from the dressing room . Pat steps over George and leaves RTÉ with Tom , telling his assistant that he should not allow anyone to undermine him before demanding that he open the door

		GOLD_MENTION=64th Golden Globe Awards
		CONTEXT=Former television columnist for '' The Star-Ledger '' Alan Sepinwall expressed his boredom on the focus given on Grey 's relationships storylines while reviewing the second season 's finale : " On those occasions when Meredith 's not involved in a plot about her love life , I do kind of like her , but those moments are so infrequent compared to her constant angsting over McDreamy -- not to mention all those seemingly unrelated storylines that always turn into a metaphor for that relationship -- that I really , really ca n't stand her . " During the show 's third season , the development of the character received negative reviews , with Cristopher Monfette of '' IGN '' stating that her storyline has become " some bizarrely under-developed sub-plot about depression and giving Derek a season 's worth of reconsidering to do . " Also during the third season , Robert Rorke of the '' New York Post '' noted the decline in Meredith 's role in the show , expressing disappointment : " She used to be the queen of the romantic dilemmas , but lately , she 's been a little dopey , what with the endless McDreamy soliloquies . " Similarly , Macleans.ca found their storyline in the fourth season overused , " This whole ' Oh I need more time , ' but ' Oh , I 'm jealous if you look at someone else ' angst was tired in the second season , frustrating in the third and now a total channel changer . The will-they-or-won ' t-they plot does n't work because they 've already been in and out of that relationship too many times . Meredith is a nag and McDreamy is henpecked . " On a more positive note , her relationship with Shepherd was included in AOL TV 's list of the " Best TV Couples of All Time " and in the same list by '' TV Guide '' . During the sixth season the development of the character was praised , Glenn Diaz of '' BuddyTV '' commented that " You got ta love Mer when she 's gloomy . " , in addition to praising Pompeo 's performance . In her review of the episode Tainted Obligation she wrote " I felt for Meredith , but after Lexie 's heartfelt begging and pleading , I was happy that Mere finally grows up and casts her selfishness aside . Three seasons ago Meredith would never have dreamed of putting Lexie first , and I was proud of her for giving up part of her liver — her offer to get to know her dad was an even bigger milestone . " Reviewing the first part of the eighth season , TV Fanatic lauded the character and wrote : " this season belongs to Meredith Grey . She is the '' heart and soul of the show '' and has been outstanding . This is a character that used to be so dark and twisty and has now grown into a more mature woman . Ellen Pompeo has been at the top of her game this season . " '' Wit & Fancy '' praised the transformation of the character and stated , " Of course Meredith will still make rash decisions like when she took off with Zola or tampered with the trial , but she does things out of love and the kindness of her heart now and not because she is dark and twisty . Considering where Meredith was at the beginning and where she is now , I think she went through a remarkable journey and did more than just growing up , she finally became ' all whole and healed ' . " Maura O'Malley of '' Bustle '' also lauded the development of the character ahead of season 12 saying , " When the series began , Meredith was just a girl sitting in a bar celebrating the exciting next phase of her life . She had graduated medical school , she was starting her residency at a prestigious hospital , and she was simply looking for a no-strings attached , one night stand . What she got instead was a complicated romantic relationship that rivals Romeo and Juliet — but the key is , she was n't searching for love . Working and learning were — and continue to be — her priorities , while McDreamy was simply an added perk . Hopefully , the new season of Grey 's Anatomy will reflect this change in tone , because Meredith is a strong , independent woman — and she will be just fine . " Later in the series , Ellen Pompeo received critical acclaim with numerous critics lauding her portrayal of the character . Reviewing the episode She 's Leaving Home '' CarterMatt '' called her the " anchor " for Grey 's saying , " Throughout , this was an episode completely anchored by Ellen Pompeo , who has done some of her best work ever on the show the past couple of weeks . Tonight , she cried , she fought , and she learned that she was carrying his child . " and added that Pompeo is often " ovelooked " saying , " Her subtlety is probably why she is often overlooked . " Rick Porter of '' Zap2it '' reviewing " How to Save a Life " wrote , " Without Meredith , and without one of Pompeo 's strongest performances in her long time on the show , " How to Save a Life " would have run the risk of coming across as a baldly manipulative death episode , the likes of which the show has done several times before . He added . " How to Save a Life " may not be the ideal Emmy-submission episode for Pompeo , considering Meredith is off screen for more than half of it . But it 's among the best work she 's ever done on the show . " '' USA Today '' also lauded Pompeo saying , " In some ways , the episode ( How to Save a Life ) was even more of a showcase for Pompeo . She had some of the more memorable and well-played scenes , from her angry response to the doctor who tries to tell her what her choices are , to her resignation when she realizes she has to comfort and motivate the young doctor whose mistakes cost Derek his life . " The relation between Meredith and Cristina has been acclaimed and been a highlight of the show . Mark Perigard of the Boston Herald considered the friendship to be " the secret core of Grey 's " . Aisha Harris of '' Slate '' called their relation '' The Best Female Friendship on TV '' adding that " With those two characters , showrunner Shonda Rhimes and her team of writers created one of the most nuanced and realistic portrayals of female friendship on television . " Samantha Highfill of '' Entertainment Weekly '' called Cristina and Meredith the best female friends on TV because " they do n't try to be " . There 's nothing fake about them , which is a rarity in how female friends are portrayed on television . She further went on to call them ' soulmates ' , " And even though they 'd never dare get sappy enough to say it , they 're soul mates . Margaret Lyons of Vulture ( magazine ) called the friendship " dream BFF relationship . " and the primary focus of the show , " One of the series ' calling cards has been its depiction of female friendship and particularly the primacy that friendship enjoyed over romantic relationships . " '' E! '' at the time of Sandra Oh 's exit wrote , " In Grey 's Anatomy 's 10-year history , the doctor duo has been through a lot together : weddings , deaths , plane crashes , bomb threats , shooting , you name it , they 've lived ( and danced ) through it . " and added , " And with the three words , ' Y '' ou 're my person . '' ' Cristina Yang and Meredith Grey solidified their status as the small screen 's best best friends ever .

		GOLD_MENTION=64th Golden Globe Awards
		CONTEXT=Former television columnist for '' The Star-Ledger '' Alan Sepinwall expressed his boredom on the focus given on Grey 's relationships storylines while reviewing the second season 's finale : " On those occasions when Meredith 's not involved in a plot about her love life , I do kind of like her , but those moments are so infrequent compared to her constant angsting over McDreamy -- not to mention all those seemingly unrelated storylines that always turn into a metaphor for that relationship -- that I really , really ca n't stand her . " During the show 's third season , the development of the character received negative reviews , with Cristopher Monfette of '' IGN '' stating that her storyline has become " some bizarrely under-developed sub-plot about depression and giving Derek a season 's worth of reconsidering to do . " Also during the third season , Robert Rorke of the '' New York Post '' noted the decline in Meredith 's role in the show , expressing disappointment : " She used to be the queen of the romantic dilemmas , but lately , she 's been a little dopey , what with the endless McDreamy soliloquies . " Similarly , Macleans.ca found their storyline in the fourth season overused , " This whole ' Oh I need more time , ' but ' Oh , I 'm jealous if you look at someone else ' angst was tired in the second season , frustrating in the third and now a total channel changer . The will-they-or-won ' t-they plot does n't work because they 've already been in and out of that relationship too many times . Meredith is a nag and McDreamy is henpecked . " On a more positive note , her relationship with Shepherd was included in AOL TV 's list of the " Best TV Couples of All Time " and in the same list by '' TV Guide '' . During the sixth season the development of the character was praised , Glenn Diaz of '' BuddyTV '' commented that " You got ta love Mer when she 's gloomy . " , in addition to praising Pompeo 's performance . In her review of the episode Tainted Obligation she wrote " I felt for Meredith , but after Lexie 's heartfelt begging and pleading , I was happy that Mere finally grows up and casts her selfishness aside . Three seasons ago Meredith would never have dreamed of putting Lexie first , and I was proud of her for giving up part of her liver — her offer to get to know her dad was an even bigger milestone . " Reviewing the first part of the eighth season , TV Fanatic lauded the character and wrote : " this season belongs to Meredith Grey . She is the '' heart and soul of the show '' and has been outstanding . This is a character that used to be so dark and twisty and has now grown into a more mature woman . Ellen Pompeo has been at the top of her game this season . " '' Wit & Fancy '' praised the transformation of the character and stated , " Of course Meredith will still make rash decisions like when she took off with Zola or tampered with the trial , but she does things out of love and the kindness of her heart now and not because she is dark and twisty . Considering where Meredith was at the beginning and where she is now , I think she went through a remarkable journey and did more than just growing up , she finally became ' all whole and healed ' . " Maura O'Malley of '' Bustle '' also lauded the development of the character ahead of season 12 saying , " When the series began , Meredith was just a girl sitting in a bar celebrating the exciting next phase of her life . She had graduated medical school , she was starting her residency at a prestigious hospital , and she was simply looking for a no-strings attached , one night stand . What she got instead was a complicated romantic relationship that rivals Romeo and Juliet — but the key is , she was n't searching for love . Working and learning were — and continue to be — her priorities , while McDreamy was simply an added perk . Hopefully , the new season of Grey 's Anatomy will reflect this change in tone , because Meredith is a strong , independent woman — and she will be just fine . " Later in the series , Ellen Pompeo received critical acclaim with numerous critics lauding her portrayal of the character . Reviewing the episode She 's Leaving Home '' CarterMatt '' called her the " anchor " for Grey 's saying , " Throughout , this was an episode completely anchored by Ellen Pompeo , who has done some of her best work ever on the show the past couple of weeks . Tonight , she cried , she fought , and she learned that she was carrying his child . " and added that Pompeo is often " ovelooked " saying , " Her subtlety is probably why she is often overlooked . " Rick Porter of '' Zap2it '' reviewing " How to Save a Life " wrote , " Without Meredith , and without one of Pompeo 's strongest performances in her long time on the show , " How to Save a Life " would have run the risk of coming across as a baldly manipulative death episode , the likes of which the show has done several times before . He added . " How to Save a Life " may not be the ideal Emmy-submission episode for Pompeo , considering Meredith is off screen for more than half of it . But it 's among the best work she 's ever done on the show . " '' USA Today '' also lauded Pompeo saying , " In some ways , the episode ( How to Save a Life ) was even more of a showcase for Pompeo . She had some of the more memorable and well-played scenes , from her angry response to the doctor who tries to tell her what her choices are , to her resignation when she realizes she has to comfort and motivate the young doctor whose mistakes cost Derek his life . " The relation between Meredith and Cristina has been acclaimed and been a highlight of the show . Mark Perigard of the Boston Herald considered the friendship to be " the secret core of Grey 's " . Aisha Harris of '' Slate '' called their relation '' The Best Female Friendship on TV '' adding that " With those two characters , showrunner Shonda Rhimes and her team of writers created one of the most nuanced and realistic portrayals of female friendship on television . " Samantha Highfill of '' Entertainment Weekly '' called Cristina and Meredith the best female friends on TV because " they do n't try to be " . There 's nothing fake about them , which is a rarity in how female friends are portrayed on television . She further went on to call them ' soulmates ' , " And even though they 'd never dare get sappy enough to say it , they 're soul mates . Margaret Lyons of Vulture ( magazine ) called the friendship " dream BFF relationship . " and the primary focus of the show , " One of the series ' calling cards has been its depiction of female friendship and particularly the primacy that friendship enjoyed over romantic relationships . " '' E! '' at the time of Sandra Oh 's exit wrote , " In Grey 's Anatomy 's 10-year history , the doctor duo has been through a lot together : weddings , deaths , plane crashes , bomb threats , shooting , you name it , they 've lived ( and danced ) through it . " and added , " And with the three words , ' Y '' ou 're my person . '' ' Cristina Yang and Meredith Grey solidified their status as the small screen 's best best friends ever . " Marama Whyte of '' Hypable '' wrote , " Critically , the key relationship in Meredith 's life was not her romance with Derek Shepherd , but her passionate , indestructible , absolutely enviable friendship with Cristina .

The performance was inspired by the recent death of her friend , fashion designer Alexander McQueen . Initially she had planned a different version of the performance , but changed the concept at the last minute , since she wanted to pay tribute to McQueen . Hence she chose acoustic versions of her songs " Telephone " and " Dance in the Dark " . She started the performance by sitting in front of a piano and announcing " This is for Alexander McQueen . " The whole performance was low-key compared to her previous ones . The stage was decked out in white , and perched on a pedestal was a statue of Gaga wearing a piano skirt and the lobster-claw heels she wore in her " Bad Romance " music video .

		CONTEXT=Norman Alfred William Lindsay ( 22 February 1879 – 21 November 1969 ) was an Australian artist , etcher , sculptor , writer , art critic , novelist , cartoonist and amateur boxer . One of the most prolific and popular Australian artists of his generation , Lindsay attracted both acclaim and controversy for his works , many of which infused the Australian landscape with erotic pagan elements and were deemed by his critics to be " anti-Christian , anti-social and degenerate " . A vocal nationalist , he became a regular artist for The Bulletin at the height of its cultural influence , and advanced staunchly anti- modernist views as a leading writer on Australian art . When friend and literary critic Bertram Stevens argued that children like to read about fairies rather than food , Lindsay wrote and illustrated The Magic Pudding ( 1918 ) , now considered a classic work of Australian children 's literature .

		GOLD_MENTION=2010 AFL Rising Star
		CONTEXT=He arrived at the club as an incredibly shy and underdeveloped personality , a fact that was noted by teammate Trent Cotchin who said though Martin was 18 “ he seemed much younger in some of the ways he behaved . ” Indeed , he struggled initially to adjust to the expectations of professional football . In one incident in the 2010 preseason he was removed from training and verbally reprimanded by club leadership when he was deemed unfit to train after a big night out . Despite these struggles , his on-field development was such that he would still debut in the 2010 season 's opening match , a 56-point Richmond loss against at the MCG . Martin recorded the sixth most disposals of any Tiger ( 18 ) to go along with four marks , three tackles and three clearances . Two weeks later Martin was convicted by the AFL tribunal for a high hit on Sydney 's Josh Kennedy in round 3 . He did not receive a suspension for the incident however , returning to football the following week . After four matches Martin ranked fourth in the league for clearances and eighth for hard-ball gets . Media reports emerged after round 8 that the 18 year old Martin had received a significant contract offer from expansion club the Greater Western Sydney Giants . The offer , which the Herald Sun ’s Mark Robinson claimed to be worth $ 2.4 million over three seasons , would have taken effect in the new club 's first AFL season in 2012 . Martin later said he had never entertained the idea of moving to the start-up club . In round 10 he had gained attention for his on-field efforts again , this time being nominated for the 2010 AFL Rising Star award after a 21 disposal and 11 clearance match against Port Adelaide . Due to his previous tribunal conviction however , Martin was ruled ineligible for the award and thus did not officially place in the end of season award 's points tally . He drew the attention of Sydney coach Paul Roos by round 14 , prompting Roos to send veteran Brett Kirk onto Martin in a tagging role . Despite this extra attention , he still managed to record 18 disposals and a goal in the match at the MCG . After 17 rounds Martin ranked second at the club for clearances and inside 50s as well as third for disposals and contested possessions . At the same time he ranked first among that season 's Rising Star nominees in clearances , contested possessions and inside 50s . He was also fourth for average disposals and fifth for average tackles . In round 19 he was rested by the club before returning to play out the final five matches of the season . He missed just that one game in his debut season and finished the year ranked second at Richmond for clearances and inside 50s , as well as third for both contested possessions and disposals . In addition to winning the Fred Swift Medal for fourth place at the club 's best and fairest night , Martin also received six votes in the Brownlow Medal count that year , the most by any Richmond debutant since Craig Lambert in 1988 . At season 's end he reiterated his commitment to the club ( and rejection of the former GWS overtures ) by signing a two-year contract extension that would keep him at Richmond until the end of the 2013 season . The extension was reported by the Herald Sun to be in the vicinity of $ 400,000-a-year

Pat asks Tom what the world really thinks of him , believing that his assistant is the only person in the world who is loyal to him . Tom attempts to avoid the question , distracting Pat by ( wrongly ) telling him that Enda Kenny has just arrived . Eventually Tom opts to tell Pat , albeit with much hesitation , that he is '' " absolutely unbelievable " '' . At that moment Enda Kenny finally arrives at the studio , still in his biker gear and collapses with exhaustion on the steps having raced through Dublin to make the interview on schedule . Kenny and Kenny square off on air and , with Pat faced with an adversary so similar in perceived personality , popularity and name he is even more unable to cope with his feelings of unworthiness than usual . Pat breaks down live on air , mistaking Enda 's rival , Taoiseach Bertie Ahern , for his own rival , '' Liveline '' presenter Joe Duffy . This prompts Enda to join him in his moment of unrelenting emotion . The next morning Tom arrives at Pat 's house . Pat assumes he has come with his P45 or details of who is to take over the mantle of the station 's highest earning broadcaster . However Tom merely points to two giant sacks of complimentary mail he has carried on his bike from RTÉ headquarters . One of them even wants to sleep with the presenter , who quickly places the letter in the left front pocket of his dressing gown . Pat is astounded to discover he is all over the news and that celebrities such as 1992 Eurovision Song Contest winner Linda Martin , music mogul Louis Walsh and Boyzone lead singer Ronan Keating are talking about him . He hurries indoors to switch on his television . There he finds that figures from the worlds of sport and politics including Irish national football team manager Steve Staunton , Ireland rugby manager Eddie O'Sullivan and Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams are lining up in their droves to pay tribute to him . He is intrigued to find Fintan O'Toole has also spoken greatly of him but becomes irritated when he finds that Steve Staunton seems to have taken over the airwaves , typically reiterating how Pat has done a great job , how he works for the team , has delivered a great result and what else can you say . Meanwhile , Bertie Ahern repeatedly rings Tom 's mobile to request an interview with Pat , but on each occasion Tom tells him to ring back later . Pat and Tom stroll into RTÉ , where George Hook is astounded to hear of Pat 's newfound popularity . He is adamant that Tom will soon join him at Newstalk but Tom shows his unswaying loyalty by declaring he will go only where Pat goes . On Friday night George slips into RTÉ and just as an episode of '' The Late Late Show '' is coming to a close , approaches Pat 's dressing room . George is inadvertently knocked to the floor by a stray microphone where he lies moaning until Pat emerges from the dressing room . Pat steps over George and leaves RTÉ with Tom , telling his assistant that he should not allow anyone to undermine him before demanding that he open the door

		GOLD_MENTION=
		CONTEXT=The total population of children in Ghana under the age of 15 is 38.01 % . The youth constitute the most important human resource potential that can contribute significantly to the overall development of a nation . The idea of children on the streets violates the children 's act which states that under no circumstance should a person below the age of fifteen be allowed to work or fend for him or herself . Therefore , the increasing phenomenon of street - ism is a menace . The street children are viewed worldly as problem ( because some of them steal to survive ) rather than people whose first habitat is the street . Obviously , extreme deprivation and social exclusion create opportunities for engaging in crime . Street children are among the most physically visible of all children , living and working on various street corners and public squares in our cities ranging from Aflao to Bawku . Ironically , they are also among the most ' invisible ' , considering that they are the most difficult groups to reach with provision of vital services such as education and healthcare , and thus the hardest to protect . Once on the street , aside being exposed to the mercy of the weather , they are vulnerable to all forms of exploitation and abuse , a life far removed from the childhood envisioned in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child . Street children represent one of the most marginalized groups of children worldwide . They face multiple deprivation of their rights on a daily basis .

		CONTEXT=After the commercial lackluster of her eighth studio album , '' Britney Jean '' ( 2013 ) , Spears started her Las Vegas residency show , Britney : Piece of Me , which attained commercial success . Later , in September 2014 , Spears posted a picture of herself in the studio , hinting that she was recording new music . In another interview , a month later , she revealed that she was working " very slowly , but progressively " on the album . In 2015 , she released the song " Pretty Girls " with Iggy Azalea , however the song was met with moderate impact and Spears headed back to the studio to record more songs , but did n't have plans to release a new album . In November 2015 , Spears teased on her Instagram account that she was working with songwriters Justin Tranter and Julia Michaels , by posting a picture of them looking " bemused " with the caption : " Working hard and hardly working ... new album ... wheeeee ! . " A month later , Tranter gave an interview for website NewNowNext about his work with Spears and commented : " Working with Britney is a fucking dream . She is so sweet , so inspiring and a master on the mic . Me and Julia had to leave the studio one day because our screams of excitement after every take she did were distracting the producers . " In late 2016 , during interviews to promote the album , Spears declared that she wanted to explore new things on the record , and that it was her " most hip-hop album , " explaining : " ... there are like two or three songs that go in the direction of more urban that I 've wanted to do for a long time now , and I just have n't really done that . " In May 2016 , in an exclusive interview for website '' Breathe Heavy '' , Tranter revealed : " Nobody ever talks about Britney as a writer and she ’s f " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " was written by Mattias Larsson , Robin Fredriksson , Julia Michaels , Justin Tranter and Sandy Chila , with production being done by Mattman & Robin . Mattman & Robin were also responsible for programming , drums , percussion , snaps , handclaps , synths , guitars , bass and kalimba , while Michaels and Jermaine Jackson provided background vocals . It was recorded at 158 Studios , Westlake Village , California , The Studio at the Palms , Las Vegas , Nevada , and at Wolf Cousins Studios , Stockholm , Sweden . " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is an electropop , and dance-pop song that lasts for three minutes and twenty-two seconds ( 3:22 ) . It features " subtle keyboards , a strummed guitar , " and " wobbly bass " in its instrumentation . For Brian Josephs of '' Spin '' , the song 's guitar slaps " recall her 2001 single ' I 'm a Slave 4 U. ' " Other critics also felt that the " strummed flamenco guitar " on the song is similar to those on Justin Timberlake 's " Like I Love You " . Bianca Gracie of '' Fuse '' opined that the song reminded her of " the glory days ( no pun intended ) of ' Circus ' and ' Femme Fatale ' . " Lyrically , " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is a flirty song about Spears " offer ing several reasons why her lover should come over and options , which can be seen in the lines " Nobody should be alone if they do n't have to be " and " I could get into that kissin ' and touchin ' / Or we could be good and do next to nothin ' . " Amy Roberts of '' Bustle '' noted that the lyrics are about hooking up , adding that they " celebrate the idea that casual relationships do n't need to be lacking respect or understanding . You do n't have to be in love with , or committing to , the person that you 're hooking up with , but that also does n't mean that you ca n't connect with them on a different level than just sex . In fact , Spears makes it clear that it 's kind of even cool if her hook-up does n't want to have sex . Her partner can draw the boundaries of where the massage she 's offering starts and ends , and if it remains as nothing more than a back rub then so be it – that 's totally cool . " For Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine , the song features " some dubious lyrics that seem to suggest masturbatory self-love " in the lines : " All I want is what you want/And all you want is me . " The chorus of the song features " a shouted gang " of backup singers , singing : " Whatever you want / whatever you need / I 'll do it ! . " Lewis Corner of Digital Spy called it " a thumping pop anthem , " praising " Britney 's seductive vocal delivery . " Gil Kaufman of '' Billboard '' named it a " fun , flirty " track . Bianca Gracie of '' Fuse '' described it as a " pulsating track that is a flirty booty call that is bound to own the dance floor . " Robbie Daw of Idolator found it to be " a traditional Spears-style chunk of dance-pop " and " arguably the best yet , with its thick whomping bass and that sparkling ' nobody should be alone if they do n't have to be ' breakdown . " Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine called it " impeccably produced downstairs music , " adding that it " is an irresistible slice of dance-pop , with an ebullient bassline and staccato acoustic guitar . " Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic declared that " some of the highlights on the album are the silliest songs , " citing " Do You Wan na Come Over " 's " overheated flamenco chorus " as an example . Maura Johnston of '' Boston Globe '' said the song was one of the album 's high points , noting that the song " is jolted to life by the slashed guitars that helped make ' Toxic ' a pop thrill . " John Murphy of musicOMH was positive while noting that the track " has a rush and urgency about it which marks it out as one of the album 's best songs . " Nolan Feeney of '' Entertainment Weekly '' also picked it as a highlight , praising the " acoustic guitars and gurgling bass lines that make for one freaky pop experiment . " Alex Macpherson of '' The Guardian '' wrote that the song " takes the party back to Britney 's heyday , " praising the inclusion of the flamenco guitar . For '' Los Angeles Times '' writer Mikael Wood , the song " restore s some of the sonic invention that once defined Spears ' biggest hits . " Nick Levine , writing for '' NME '' , echoed the same thought , writing : " The lusty strut of ‘ Do You Wan na Come Over ? ’ nods to her early-noughties Neptunes-produced hits . " In his Vice column , Robert Christgau selected " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " and " Clumsy " as his favorite tracks on the album . Amy Mackelden of '' Bustle '' elaborated about the track : With a strong '90s vibe , an upbeat tempo , and a surprising rhythm , " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " utilizes the best of Spears ' talents . ... " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " embraces the current trend for songs that are musically complicated , that layer up their beats and sound effects , and feature multiple voices and infectious shouting during their choruses . Much like Hailee Steinfeld and Gwen Stefani 's latest offerings , " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is melodic , has a fast tempo , and is instantly recognizable . And most importantly , it 's fun . On August 18 , 2016 , Spears added " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " , as well as " Make Me ... " , to the setlist of her Las Vegas residency show Britney : Piece of Me . Later , on September 1 , 2016 , a performance of the song was broadcast from Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas for Today . During the performance , she used " an outfit similar to her risqué costume from 2016 's VMAs , while her backup dancers stood out in brightly-colored tank tops and shorts , " as reported by '' Entertainment Weekly '' Ruth Kinane . The song was also included in Spears 's setlist for the iHeartRadio Music Festival on September 24 , 2016 . Spears also performed it at I Heart Radio Jingle Ball , Triple Show and B26 Pepsi Jingle Bash during December 2016 . Also performed it at Apple Music Festival which was held in United Kingdom

		ANSWER=Louder
		GOLD_MENTION=2014 World Music Awards
		CONTEXT=The album received mixed reviews from music critics . According to review aggregator Metacritic , the album has a score of 48/100 based on 8 reviews , indicating " mixed or average reviews " . On another aggregator website , Album of the Year , it holds the 4th position on a list of worst reviewed albums of 2014 . Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic gave the album 2.5 stars out of 5 saying that " Michele is not a natural pop star . This was true in 2009 when she debuted on '' Glee '' as Rachel Berry and it 's even clearer in 2014 . " Mike Ayers from '' Billboard '' gave a mostly positive review , saying , " Lyrically , '' Louder '' is rather one-sided , as she often sings about the perils of relationships , over and over , in ways that we 've all heard many times at this point . Still , it 's a solid effort that shows she has promise as a bonafide pop artist . " Sarah Rodman of '' The Boston Globe '' gave the album a mostly positive review , writing , " The Broadway veteran puts her mighty soprano through its paces on bouncy dance tracks , soaring ballads , and midtempo pop tunes where she straddles the line , mostly comfortably , between Katy Perry and Celine Dion . " Kyle Anderson of '' Entertainment Weekly '' gave the album a B - , writing , " It 's hard to be that mad at '' Louder '' , because it 's so admirably and lovingly crafted . There 's nothing wrong with Lea Michele 's debut , and that 's its biggest problem . While well curated and exquisitely executed , '' Louder '' is missing the visceral oomph that defines the gulf between superstars and the rest of the top 40 chum . " At '' USA Today '' , Jerry Shriver rated the album 2.5 stars out of four , and stated that " softer would have been a better approach . " He added that the song " Battlefield " points to a more promising direction . Kevin McFarland of '' The A.V. Club '' gave a C - rating , writing , " '' Louder '' , Michele 's debut solo album under her own name , does feature her distinctive talent as a vocalist . But the record is caught in an unfortunate stylistic limbo between fun-loving , youthful pop and the maturity of adult contemporary artists . " Jim Farber of the '' New York Daily News '' awarded the album two stars . He criticized , " Michele does n't so much sing as trumpet like an elephant eager for the charge . Her voice has more need than vulnerability , more anger than understanding . " Christopher R. Weingarten of '' Rolling Stone '' also gave a negative review , stating , " This album of insta-dated EDM-pop anthems and half-cocked bass drops probably wo n't help Michele 's cause . The songs about love 's ups and downs have a few memorable lyrics ( ' My heart 's too drunk to drive ' ) but not nearly enough . " '' Louder '' was nominated for World 's Best Album at the 2014 World Music Awards , held in Monaco on May 27 , 2014

Later , in September 2014 , Spears posted a picture of herself in the studio , hinting that she was recording new music . In another interview , a month later , she revealed that she was working " very slowly , but progressively " on the album . In 2015 , she released the song " Pretty Girls " with Iggy Azalea , however the song was met with moderate impact and Spears headed back to the studio to record more songs , but did n't have plans to release a new album . In November 2015 , Spears teased on her Instagram account that she was working with songwriters Justin Tranter and Julia Michaels , by posting a picture of them looking " bemused " with the caption : " Working hard and hardly working ... new album ... wheeeee ! . " A month later , Tranter gave an interview for website NewNowNext about his work with Spears and commented : " Working with Britney is a fucking dream . She is so sweet , so inspiring and a master on the mic . Me and Julia had to leave the studio one day because our screams of excitement after every take she did were distracting the producers . " In late 2016 , during interviews to promote the album , Spears declared that she wanted to explore new things on the record , and that it was her " most hip-hop album , " explaining : " ... there are like two or three songs that go in the direction of more urban that I 've wanted to do for a long time now , and I just have n't really done that . " In May 2016 , in an exclusive interview for website '' Breathe Heavy '' , Tranter revealed : " Nobody ever talks about Britney as a writer and she ’s f " Do You Wan na Come Over ?

Mattman & Robin were also responsible for programming , drums , percussion , snaps , handclaps , synths , guitars , bass and kalimba , while Michaels and Jermaine Jackson provided background vocals . It was recorded at 158 Studios , Westlake Village , California , The Studio at the Palms , Las Vegas , Nevada , and at Wolf Cousins Studios , Stockholm , Sweden . " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is an electropop , and dance-pop song that lasts for three minutes and twenty-two seconds ( 3:22 ) . It features " subtle keyboards , a strummed guitar , " and " wobbly bass " in its instrumentation . For Brian Josephs of '' Spin '' , the song 's guitar slaps " recall her 2001 single ' I 'm a Slave 4 U.

Bianca Gracie of '' Fuse '' opined that the song reminded her of " the glory days ( no pun intended ) of ' Circus ' and ' Femme Fatale ' . " Lyrically , " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is a flirty song about Spears " offer ing several reasons why her lover should come over and options , which can be seen in the lines " Nobody should be alone if they do n't have to be " and " I could get into that kissin ' and touchin ' / Or we could be good and do next to nothin ' . " Amy Roberts of '' Bustle '' noted that the lyrics are about hooking up , adding that they " celebrate the idea that casual relationships do n't need to be lacking respect or understanding . You do n't have to be in love with , or committing to , the person that you 're hooking up with , but that also does n't mean that you ca n't connect with them on a different level than just sex .

Her partner can draw the boundaries of where the massage she 's offering starts and ends , and if it remains as nothing more than a back rub then so be it – that 's totally cool .

		CONTEXT=Dan Kelly was an American pioneer recording artist , best known for his ' Pat Brady ' series of humorous recitations . Kelly was born in New York City January 22 , 1842 . Both of his parents were musicians , and he began performing at 13 years old , at Wyatt 's Theater in Hartford , Connecticut . He continued in minstrel shows such as Bryant 's and Christy 's , as well as traveling panorama demonstrations , before moving to Cincinnati to record for the Ohio Phonograph Company ( a regional subsidiary of the North American Phonograph Company ) . Kelly recorded also for the Columbia Phonograph Company and New Jersey Phonograph Company ( also subsidiaries of North American at the time ) . An article in The Phonogram magazine speaks to his popularity in the early 1890s - " Where is there a phonograph in the United States or Canada without a Brady ? The answer is , no - where ! " , and " Kelly [ ... ] stands to - day the acknowledged head of all humorous talkers for the phonograph " . For all of his fame in the earliest days of the phonograph industry , he does n't seem to have made any recordings later than 1893 or 1894 , and it 's unclear what he did later in life . Because he only recorded onto ' brown wax ' cylinders , few of his recordings survive today .

		CONTEXT=" Motivation " is a R&B slow jam song written by Richard Butler ( Rico Love ) , Jim Jonsin , Dwayne Carter and Danny Morris . The racy lyrics center around Rowland asking her man to use his hands all over her body , and are accompanied by a " synth-saturated beat " produced by Jonsin . In terms of instruments , " Motivation " uses sparse keyboard notes , programmed beats and pulsing synths in the chorus . Wayne adds a rap verse complementing Rowland 's seductive suggestions , using the kitchen and a car as metaphors for sex . According to Scott Shetler from AOL Music , Rowland uses the lyrics to promise " to be her lover 's motivation . " Rowland called the record a mixture between dance and mash-up . When asked by MTV what Rowland thought of the song , she said , " It has that personality and characteristic to it that I do n't think anybody can deny . That 's why when Wayne dropped that insane verse on there ... I was like , ' You really brought that up even more . ' He went into the studio and just did it . I do n't think it takes much for Wayne to think . He just does it . He 's so admirable . " Ryan Brockington , from the '' New York Post , '' was amongst the first to review " Motivation . " In his review , he said " The single is a big leap from the dance club synth pop that Kelly has been releasing the past year and it seems like she might be trying to shimmy her way back into the hip-hop world by teaming up with the Midas touch vocals of Lil Wayne . " Both '' Rap-Up '' and AOL Music 's Scott Shetler called the song " sexy . " Becky Bain from Idolator disliked the song for not being memorable . The short review was summed up with the closing phrase , " she ’s going to need another hit to help promote her album when it finally is ready to drop . " Wesley Case from '' The Baltimore Sun '' complemented the song 's sexy quality . " If this is n't the year 's hands-down sexiest song thus far , it has to be in the discussion . Rowland , whose sultry voice could get a priest hot , weaving in and out of the minimal beat , and setting the table for Lil Wayne 's stuttering , after-hours guest-verse . Stack the pieces together and it 's an understated knockout that gets sexier with each spin . " Billboard ranked it number five on their " Critics ' Picks : 20 Best Songs of 2011 " " Motivation " was nominated for two awards at the 2011 Soul Train Music Awards including Best Dance Performance and Song of the Year.It won the award for Song of the Year and was also nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration at the 54th Grammy Awards , which was held on February 12 , 2012

Check it out ! " , said Will . " Then I go dirty Caribbean on him on the last verse . " Monica Herrera wrote for '' Billboard '' that " the music is expertly produced , but problems arise when Will.i.am claims the same of his wordplay . On the track ' Do n't Stop the Party ' , he chest-thumps , ' Kill you with my lyricals/Call me verbal criminal . ' It 's a silly boast for an artist who clearly focuses on beats over rhymes , and is probably better off for it . " Andy Gill wrote for '' The Independent '' that " with martial synth-stomp riffs , spartan electro beats and loping bass grooves driving tracks whose single-mindedness is signalled by titles like ' Do n't Stop the Party ' . " A positive review came from Bill Lamb , editor from About.com , who went to say that : " BEP boost the beat as they request ' Do n't Stop the Party ' . " Lamb said that " will.i.am starts talking about futurism here again and sure enough we find ourselves in the middle of a futuristic sounding trance break . The party reaches its peak about five minutes into the song , and it is exhilarating . " Other positive reaction came from John Bush , editor from Allmusic who went to say that the song is a " scattered moment of respectability " and chose it as an " AMG Pick " . Gavin Martin wrote for '' Daily Mirror '' that " the operatically ambitious ' Do n't Stop the Party ' gives way to a briefly terrifying interlude that is more or less a declaration of earth-shaking sonic war .

		ANSWER=What Goes Around
		GOLD_MENTION=2015 Country Music Association Awards
		CONTEXT=Unlike his previous record primarily focused on R&B and pop genres , '' FutureSex/LoveSounds '' is less concentrated on one particular sound , thus representing a wider range . Timberlake explains , " It 's more broad as far as the styles I wanted to mix in to my own type of thing . " A musically " complex " album , '' FutureSex/LoveSounds '' is a fusion of rap , rock , funk , soul , gospel , new wave , opera , and world music , characterized by preludes and interludes interspersed on the album 's tracks . '' Entertainment Weekly '' noted that the album 's sound is a " sonic departure " from both NSYNC and '' Justified '' . Although " What Goes Around " sounds similar to '' Justified '' , Timberlake admitted that it is the only song in the new album to have such similarity . '' The 20/20 Experience '' is a neo soul album partly inspired by the expansive song structures of 1960s and 1970s rock . Mikael Wood of the '' Los Angeles Times '' found its elaborate structures ambitious in the vein of Stevie Wonder , Prince , and Michael Jackson . Since his marriage , he incorporated themes of romance in his songwriting , as '' Complex '' noted , showing that he " writes his tracks on his emotions , leaving him with a career of personal albums . " Moments of emotional pain after betrayal influenced the songwriting of some previous records . Longtime critic Robert Hilburn for the '' Los Angeles Times '' praised Timberlake 's act after attending the Justified and Stripped Tour in 2003 , considering him " born for the stage ( with ) the savvy instincts to put together a show that works . Rather than make himself the constant center of attention , he was comfortable enough at times simply to be part of a talented ensemble . " In 2013 , Timberlake introduced his big-band orchestra called the Tennessee Kids for Legends of the Summer and The 20/20 Experience World Tour which includes guitarists , dancers , background singers , drummers , bassists , keyboardists , trumpeters , a music coordinator , a percussionist , a saxophonist , among others musicians . The 20/20 Experience allowed Timberlake to throw back to the big-band era , its stage production embraced a vintage sheen and everyone in classic suits . For the tour , Timberlake had a horn section onstage with him called The Regiment Horns .

		GOLD_MENTION=2014 World Music Awards
		CONTEXT=The album received mixed reviews from music critics . According to review aggregator Metacritic , the album has a score of 48/100 based on 8 reviews , indicating " mixed or average reviews " . On another aggregator website , Album of the Year , it holds the 4th position on a list of worst reviewed albums of 2014 . Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic gave the album 2.5 stars out of 5 saying that " Michele is not a natural pop star . This was true in 2009 when she debuted on '' Glee '' as Rachel Berry and it 's even clearer in 2014 . " Mike Ayers from '' Billboard '' gave a mostly positive review , saying , " Lyrically , '' Louder '' is rather one-sided , as she often sings about the perils of relationships , over and over , in ways that we 've all heard many times at this point . Still , it 's a solid effort that shows she has promise as a bonafide pop artist . " Sarah Rodman of '' The Boston Globe '' gave the album a mostly positive review , writing , " The Broadway veteran puts her mighty soprano through its paces on bouncy dance tracks , soaring ballads , and midtempo pop tunes where she straddles the line , mostly comfortably , between Katy Perry and Celine Dion . " Kyle Anderson of '' Entertainment Weekly '' gave the album a B - , writing , " It 's hard to be that mad at '' Louder '' , because it 's so admirably and lovingly crafted . There 's nothing wrong with Lea Michele 's debut , and that 's its biggest problem . While well curated and exquisitely executed , '' Louder '' is missing the visceral oomph that defines the gulf between superstars and the rest of the top 40 chum . " At '' USA Today '' , Jerry Shriver rated the album 2.5 stars out of four , and stated that " softer would have been a better approach . " He added that the song " Battlefield " points to a more promising direction . Kevin McFarland of '' The A.V. Club '' gave a C - rating , writing , " '' Louder '' , Michele 's debut solo album under her own name , does feature her distinctive talent as a vocalist . But the record is caught in an unfortunate stylistic limbo between fun-loving , youthful pop and the maturity of adult contemporary artists . " Jim Farber of the '' New York Daily News '' awarded the album two stars . He criticized , " Michele does n't so much sing as trumpet like an elephant eager for the charge . Her voice has more need than vulnerability , more anger than understanding . " Christopher R. Weingarten of '' Rolling Stone '' also gave a negative review , stating , " This album of insta-dated EDM-pop anthems and half-cocked bass drops probably wo n't help Michele 's cause . The songs about love 's ups and downs have a few memorable lyrics ( ' My heart 's too drunk to drive ' ) but not nearly enough . " '' Louder '' was nominated for World 's Best Album at the 2014 World Music Awards , held in Monaco on May 27 , 2014

		ANSWER=Abadiyev
		GOLD_MENTION=deported along with the entire Ingush civilian population
		CONTEXT=Abadiyev was born over a decade before the October Revolution in the Ingush village of Nasyr-Kort . Having been born during the Russo-Japanese War , he was named " Yaponts " , ( meaning Japanese ) due to the Ingush tradition of sometimes naming children with the ethnonyms of the peoples they fought in battle . After entering the Red Army in 1924 he was sent to cavalry school , where cadets participated in the liquidation of the kulaks . In 1930 he graduated from cavalry school and was stationed in the city of Vladikavkaz as a squadron commander . That year he was presented with an engraved Gewehr 98 , after recommendation of the commander of the 28th Rifle Division , A. D. Kazitsky . He became a member of the Communist Party in 1938 , in March 1939 he was appointed as the Chief of Staff of the 39th Cavalry Regiment , and in 1940 he was promoted to the position of deputy commander of the 107th Cossack Cavalry Regiment based in Armavir . In the early days of Operation Barbarossa , Abadiyev was on the front lines of the Second World War . Initially he was deputy commander of the 117th Heavy Tank Regiment based in Smolensk , which was subjected to heavy bombardments . He went on to command the 126th Cavalry Regiment of the 28th Cavalry Division in Pavlohrad . On 16 August 1941 , General Rodion Malinovsky the commander of the 6th Army , tasked Abadiyev with leading an attack to push back enemy forces in the region of Sursk-Litovsk towards the Dnieper . On August 19 , his regiment was the first in the region to begin the attack . The cavalrymen destroyed two enemy companies and completely expelled enemy forces from the village . From August 20 to 23 , Abadiyev managed to organize the repulsion of a tank offensive . The regiment assumed the main fire , and thus ensured the safe exit of the division from the battlefield , ensuring the success of the operation . In October 1941 , he sustained a head injury but continued to remain in command of his regiment . On 5 November 1941 he was awarded the Order of the Red Banner for success in combat . In March 1942 he was appointed as the commander of the newly formed 255th Separate Chechen-Ingush Cavalry Regiment , but soon accepted a new position and was replaced by his chief of staff Movlid Visaitov in May . Abadiyev was briefly in command of the 297th Cavalry Regiment of the 115th Kabardian-Balkar Cavalry Division before he was sent to command the 278th Cavalry Regiment in July , which was within the same division . In July 1942 German troops broke through the southern part of the front , which resulted in the division engaging in defensive operations in the North Caucasus , Stalingrad , and in the heavy fighting between the Don and Volga rivers . Earlier that year in June the division had received orders to fight off the 4th German Tank Army near the village of Konstantinovsk ; in the following defensive operation , the division would lost more than half of its personnel . On the evening of July 29 , the division took their positions for a counterattack , but the German tanks attacked first , destroying the headquarters of Major-General Boris Pogrebov before the 115th division could launch their offensive . Nevertheless , Abadiyev and his cavalrymen fought to their last , and the German who troops broke through the defensive line did so in Tsimlyansk area , which was junctioned between the 91st and 157th Rifle Divisions . It was noted by the command of the 51st Army that the regimental commanders of the 115th Division acted bravely and showed resilience . During one engagement in the summer of 1942 , Abadiyev was seriously wounded and nearly killed , but his horse saved his life and carried him off the battlefield under heavy enemy fire . The 115th Division was disbanded in October 1942 while Abadiyev was in the hospital , after having lost over two-thirds of its personnel ; the survivors of unit were sent to anti-tank and reconnaissance units . After recovering from his injuries he attended the Frunze Military Academy and briefly taught at the Arzamas Higher Officer Staff School before being redeployed to the warfront . He participated in the Battle of Stalingrad and the fighting at the Khopyor River . For his actions in repelling attacks from German tanks he was nominated for the title Hero of the Soviet Union by Konstantin Rokossovsky , but he did not receive the title . On 23 February 1944 his family was deported along with the entire Ingush civilian population ; the Soviet government had labeled Vainakh peoples as " traitors to the motherland " and ordered the mass relocation of them to prison settlements in Central Asia . Yaponts Abadiyev was recalled from the front , but not immediately sent to a " special settlement " and was instead allowed to command a reserve regiment in Orenburg and then serve as deputy commander of the 28th Reserve Regiment in Bashkortostan . When the war officially ended he was stationed in Gorky as a battalion commander . After the war he was assigned to command construction battalions in Vladimir , Ryazan , Moscow , Berezniki , and Kuibyshev , before returning to Ingushetia in the early 1980s . He retired from the military in the 1950s with the rank of lieutenant-colonel . After his death in 1985 he was posthumously awarded the Order of Lenin , the medal of which was presented to his living relatives . There are memorial plaques bearing his name in Volgograd in a museum and Mamayev Kurgan

		GOLD_MENTION=great purge
		CONTEXT=Immediately after the assassination of Sergey Kirov in Leningrad on 1 December 1934 , Agranov was entrusted with the organization of mass reprisals in the city . Stalin ordered him to fabricate a story that Lev Kamenev , Grigory Zinoviev and other leaders of the opposition were responsible for the murder , but seems to have resisted , whereupon Stalin entrusted Nikolai Yezhov to do it instead . In 1935 , he was ordered by Yezhov to track down and liquidate " an undiscovered centre of Trotskyists " in Moscow , as a preparatory step for the great purge that Stalin was planning . When Yezhov took over as head of the NKVD , Agranov remained his First Deputy , and in December 1936 was appointed Head of the Chief Directorate of State Security , which seemingly meant that he was to be trusted to purge the NKVD of officers Yezhov did not trust . In February 1937 , he circulated regional NKVD heads demanding names of Trotskyists and other oppositionists employed with the state security apparatus . In April , he was demoted to the post of regional NKVD chief in Saratov . He was arrested on 20 July 1937 , and appeared on the execution list of 1 November 1937 , in which his name was crossed out .

		ANSWER=mechanism to coexist alongside central planning
		GOLD_MENTION=
		CONTEXT=Agriculture in the Soviet Union was mostly collectivized , with some limited cultivation of private plots . It is often viewed as one of the more inefficient sectors of the economy of the Soviet Union . A number of food taxes ( prodrazverstka , prodnalog , and others ) were introduced in the early Soviet period despite the Decree on Land that immediately followed the October Revolution . The forced collectivization and class war against ( vaguely defined ) " kulaks " under Stalinism greatly disrupted farm output in the 1920s and 1930s , contributing to the Soviet famine of 1932 – 33 ( most especially the holodomor in Ukraine ) . A system of state and collective farms , known as sovkhozes and kolkhozes , respectively , placed the rural population in a system intended to be unprecedentedly productive and fair but which turned out to be chronically inefficient and lacking in fairness . Under the administrations of Nikita Khrushchev , Leonid Brezhnev , and Mikhail Gorbachev , many reforms ( such as Khrushchev 's Virgin Lands Campaign ) were enacted as attempts to defray the inefficiencies of the Stalinist agricultural system . However , Marxist – Leninist ideology did not allow for any substantial amount of market mechanism to coexist alongside central planning , so the private plot fraction of Soviet agriculture , which was its most productive , remained confined to a limited role . Throughout its later decades the Soviet Union never stopped using substantial portions of the precious metals mined each year in Siberia to pay for grain imports , which has been taken by various authors as an economic indicator showing that the country 's agriculture was never as successful as it ought to have been . The real numbers , however , were treated as state secrets at the time , so accurate analysis of the sector 's performance was limited outside the USSR and nearly impossible to assemble within its borders . However , Soviet citizens as consumers were familiar with the fact that foods , especially meats , were often noticeably scarce , to the point that not lack of money so much as lack of things to buy with it was the limiting factor in their standard of living .

		ANSWER=Cyclotron turnover
		GOLD_MENTION=
		CONTEXT=Cyclotron turnover is one of two phenomena due to which the power spectrum of synchrotron radiation decreases at very low frequencies . The other is synchrotron self - absorption . While the synchrotron self - absorption is determined from detailed balance , cyclotron turnover occurs when the assumptions of synchrotron radiation are violated . When a charged particle moves in a magnetic field , its orbit is a helix , and its velocities can be divided into two independent components : uniform velocity parallel to the axis of the helix and rotation about the axis . Synchrotron radiation requires that both velocities be ultra-relativistic , but if the velocity parallel to the axis is relativistic and the rotation is not , then the spectrum would simply be that of a Doppler - shifted cyclotron radiation , and this behavior is called cyclotron turnover . In real systems there would be a competition between these two phenomena , so the only one that sets in at higher frequencies will be observed . An interesting feature about the cyclotron turnover is that it allows emission at frequencies lower that the cyclotron frequency , if the particle is moving away from the observer .

		CONTEXT=In August , 2006 , at the 64th World Science Fiction Convention , in a give-and-take with her audience , Willis described her novel-in-progress : " It 's about World War 2 , and I have four historians ... One of them is with the evacuating children in the North of England ; one of them is doing the Blitz ; one of them is doing the civilian evacuation from Dunkirk , '' of '' soldiers but '' by '' civilians ; and one of them is doing the Intelligence War involved in the lead-up to D-Day , where they fooled Hitler into thinking we were attacking at Calais , instead of at Normandy . And their lives are hopelessly intertwined ; but then they all get in trouble &mdash; you know my books &mdash; they all get in terrible trouble and ca n't get out of it . And are stuck in World War II , for God 's sake ! So : Not a safe place to be . " ( An audience member called , " Better than the Plague ! " ) Willis laughed but replied , " Not necessarily better than the Plague ! In slightly better survival chance because they have the advantage of some knowledge that the locals do n't have , but then again , historical events are notoriously inaccurate , and just because you think you know where all the bombs fell , does n't mean you do . So that will figure heavily in the book ... I have a lot of stuff to tell you about the war ... The Brits were absolutely wonderful ... They '' were '' great and plucky and funny under pressure . " In a February 12 , 2010 interview Connie Willis said : What are '' Blackout '' and '' All Clear '' about ? They 're about Dunkirk and ration books and D-Day and V-1 rockets , about tube shelters and Bletchley Park and gas masks and stirrup pumps and Christmas pantomimes and cows and crossword puzzles and the deception campaign . And mostly the book 's about all the people who " did their bit " to save the world from Hitler &mdash; Shakespearean actors and ambulance drivers and vicars and landladies and nurses and WRENs and RAF pilots and Winston Churchill and General Patton and Agatha Christie &mdash; heroes all . Michael Dirda of '' The Washington Post '' praised the diptych as " as vivid an evocation of England during World War II as anyone has ever written " and wrote that " '' Blackout '' is , by turns , witty , suspenseful , harrowing and occasionally comic to the point of slapstick . " Adrienne Martini of Locus Online called the 1940s Britain that Willis created " richly textured " . A. M. Dellamonica described the story as " an intricate puzzle " and " a celebration , too , of courage and heroism , of perseverance , of ordinary people doing small things to aid in great causes , of devotion , friendship , keeping one 's word . It has funny characters and laugh out loud moments aplenty , but it is no wacky romp , this book , no '' To Say Nothing of the Dog '' . At the same time , I found it funnier and , strangely , cheerier than previous Willis novels with a comparable body count . " Thomas M. Wagner called '' Blackout '' " an absolute monster of an epic , a time-travel saga so rich in scope that it 's taking two volumes to tell , yet so intimate in its observation of character that what you take away from it are not thrilling action setpieces but those moments of bonding people share — warm , funny , confused , trivial , angry , heartfelt — that take on a new and infinitely greater meaning in the shadow of death ... Amid the growing suspense , Willis builds an engrossing work of humanist fiction that avoids pathos and easy sentiment in depicting the quiet practicality and occasional heroism ( and yes , the callousness ) of Londoners surviving the Blitz . Memorable characters abound , and Willis 's gift for natural dialogue brings scenes to life in a way that makes you feel you 're in their presence . And she never pulls the lame stunt of creating a character for you to love just to kill them as an exercise in cheap button mashing . We get to know every one of the people with whom Polly shares a shelter every night , like the blustery , avuncular stage actor Sir Godfrey Kingsman , who quotes the Bard every time he opens his mouth yet whose personality rings true all the same . Eileen finds herself saddled with two of the most ill-behaved children in history , and yet you kind of like them , especially because , as a sort of brother-and-sister demolition duo with an appallingly indifferent and irresponsible mother , you realize they 've only ever had each other . " Julie Phillips of '' The Village Voice '' wrote , " '' Blackout/All Clear '' is neither tragedy nor comedy , but a mystery story with touches of grief and slapstick ... None of the three historians manages to stand by and observe ... The cast of characters is long , but Willis convinces you to care about almost all their fates — and to surprise you about their connection to each other . Willis 's evocation of wartime London sometimes feels romanticized , and it has few moral or demographic complications ... Nor is Willis 's theme , the heroism of ordinary people , especially original . But by the time the three historians and Mr. Dunworthy have unraveled the mystery and arrived at the full-on , three-hanky finale , you 'll no longer be a disinterested observer . " Some reviewers complained of the length of the books and their narrative modes . Christopher DeFilippis , writing for the SF Site , said he thought the books " can best be described by words like ' belabored ' and ' exasperating . ' That 's because the single story told in '' Blackout '' and '' All Clear '' did n't have to encompass two novels . Had it not been marred by endlessly repetitive prose and character actions , the narrative could have fit neatly into a single volume ... Unfortunately , the bulk of '' Blackout '' is taken up by Polly , Mike and Eileen 's individual realizations that they 're trapped in the past , with each caught in a state of seemingly perpetual denial about their circumstances . Instead of acknowledging the blatant truth of their predicament , they concoct endless mental scenarios as to why their gates wo n't open ... Willis goes on for pages with her protagonists repeatedly ruminating about the same " what ifs " over and over ( and over ) again . It may be understandable in the beginning of the story as the characters adjust to the magnitude of their situation . But it soon becomes apparent that this is what constitutes drama in Willis ' universe and it never stops ... It 's a shame that these negatives so overwhelm '' Blackout '' and '' All Clear '' , because despite them the books feature many terrific characters moving in extremely interesting historical situations . " Similarly , Adam Roberts of '' The Guardian '' wrote , " The result is a mildly interesting 200-page novel about the ordinary heroism of British civilians during the war , bloated to 800 pages via an egregiously handled time-travel conceit , eked out with great jellied quantities of historical research , endless meandering conversations , long passages disposed into that tiresome typographical convention by which characters ' inmost thoughts are spelled out in italics , and a string of inconsequential chapter-end cliffhangers/immediate resolutions that got increasingly on my nerves as the book went on . There 's little overall tension , and the time-travelling historians come over as both panicky and amateurish – an undesirable combination , one might think , where timelines are lying about ready to be mucked up . " He added , though , " The aim is a commendable one . Despite walk-on parts by General Patton , Agatha Christie and Alan Turing , the bulk of the characters in '' All Clear '' are ordinary people getting on with their ordinary lives ... And it ca n't be denied that the subject here , the heroism of ordinary people in testing times , is worthy and honourable . "

Aside from the ebb and flow of piracy , sea-travel was fraught with superhuman hazard and uncertainty until the Industrial Revolution . It is impossible to assess the spiritual crisis in Aegean culture 's relations with the sea 's dangers and the capacity of its divinities that must have been engendered by the tsunamis that accompanied the volcanic explosion and collapse of Thera , ca. 1650 &ndash; 1600 BCE . Can the sense of the sea and its deities have survived the cataclysm unchanged ? It seems unlikely . The sea could therefore stand as a powerful symbol of the unknown and otherworldly . Although many people thought about the sea and her depths , no one would enter the watery grave

In 1871 the Mudan incident happened : cannibal Taiwanese aborigines murdered 54 Ryūkyūan sailors that had their ship shipwrecked . At that time the Ryukyu Islands were claimed by both Qing China and Japan , and the Japanese interpreted the incident as an attack on their citizens . They took steps to bring the islands in their jurisdiction : in 1872 the Japanese Ryukyu Domain was declared , and in 1874 a retaliatory incursion to Taiwan was sent , which was a success . The success of this expedition emboldened the Japanese : not even the Americans could defeat the Taiwanese cannibals in the Formosa Expedition of 1867 . Very few gave it much thought at the time , but this was the first move in the Japanese expansionism series . Japan occupied Taiwan for the rest of 1874 and then left owing to Chinese pressures , but in 1879 it finally annexed the Ryukyu Islands . In 1875 Qing China sent a 300-men force to subdue the Taiwanese cannibals , but unlike the Japanese the Chinese were routed , ambushed and 250 of their men were killed ; the failure of this expedition exposed once more the failure of Qing China to exert effective control in Taiwan , and acted as another incentive for the Japanese to annex Taiwan . Eventually , the spoils for winning the First Sino-Japanese War in 1894 included Taiwan

		ANSWER=Spears
		GOLD_MENTION=VMAs
		CONTEXT=After the commercial lackluster of her eighth studio album , '' Britney Jean '' ( 2013 ) , Spears started her Las Vegas residency show , Britney : Piece of Me , which attained commercial success . Later , in September 2014 , Spears posted a picture of herself in the studio , hinting that she was recording new music . In another interview , a month later , she revealed that she was working " very slowly , but progressively " on the album . In 2015 , she released the song " Pretty Girls " with Iggy Azalea , however the song was met with moderate impact and Spears headed back to the studio to record more songs , but did n't have plans to release a new album . In November 2015 , Spears teased on her Instagram account that she was working with songwriters Justin Tranter and Julia Michaels , by posting a picture of them looking " bemused " with the caption : " Working hard and hardly working ... new album ... wheeeee ! . " A month later , Tranter gave an interview for website NewNowNext about his work with Spears and commented : " Working with Britney is a fucking dream . She is so sweet , so inspiring and a master on the mic . Me and Julia had to leave the studio one day because our screams of excitement after every take she did were distracting the producers . " In late 2016 , during interviews to promote the album , Spears declared that she wanted to explore new things on the record , and that it was her " most hip-hop album , " explaining : " ... there are like two or three songs that go in the direction of more urban that I 've wanted to do for a long time now , and I just have n't really done that . " In May 2016 , in an exclusive interview for website '' Breathe Heavy '' , Tranter revealed : " Nobody ever talks about Britney as a writer and she ’s f " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " was written by Mattias Larsson , Robin Fredriksson , Julia Michaels , Justin Tranter and Sandy Chila , with production being done by Mattman & Robin . Mattman & Robin were also responsible for programming , drums , percussion , snaps , handclaps , synths , guitars , bass and kalimba , while Michaels and Jermaine Jackson provided background vocals . It was recorded at 158 Studios , Westlake Village , California , The Studio at the Palms , Las Vegas , Nevada , and at Wolf Cousins Studios , Stockholm , Sweden . " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is an electropop , and dance-pop song that lasts for three minutes and twenty-two seconds ( 3:22 ) . It features " subtle keyboards , a strummed guitar , " and " wobbly bass " in its instrumentation . For Brian Josephs of '' Spin '' , the song 's guitar slaps " recall her 2001 single ' I 'm a Slave 4 U. ' " Other critics also felt that the " strummed flamenco guitar " on the song is similar to those on Justin Timberlake 's " Like I Love You " . Bianca Gracie of '' Fuse '' opined that the song reminded her of " the glory days ( no pun intended ) of ' Circus ' and ' Femme Fatale ' . " Lyrically , " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is a flirty song about Spears " offer ing several reasons why her lover should come over and options , which can be seen in the lines " Nobody should be alone if they do n't have to be " and " I could get into that kissin ' and touchin ' / Or we could be good and do next to nothin ' . " Amy Roberts of '' Bustle '' noted that the lyrics are about hooking up , adding that they " celebrate the idea that casual relationships do n't need to be lacking respect or understanding . You do n't have to be in love with , or committing to , the person that you 're hooking up with , but that also does n't mean that you ca n't connect with them on a different level than just sex . In fact , Spears makes it clear that it 's kind of even cool if her hook-up does n't want to have sex . Her partner can draw the boundaries of where the massage she 's offering starts and ends , and if it remains as nothing more than a back rub then so be it – that 's totally cool . " For Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine , the song features " some dubious lyrics that seem to suggest masturbatory self-love " in the lines : " All I want is what you want/And all you want is me . " The chorus of the song features " a shouted gang " of backup singers , singing : " Whatever you want / whatever you need / I 'll do it ! . " Lewis Corner of Digital Spy called it " a thumping pop anthem , " praising " Britney 's seductive vocal delivery . " Gil Kaufman of '' Billboard '' named it a " fun , flirty " track . Bianca Gracie of '' Fuse '' described it as a " pulsating track that is a flirty booty call that is bound to own the dance floor . " Robbie Daw of Idolator found it to be " a traditional Spears-style chunk of dance-pop " and " arguably the best yet , with its thick whomping bass and that sparkling ' nobody should be alone if they do n't have to be ' breakdown . " Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine called it " impeccably produced downstairs music , " adding that it " is an irresistible slice of dance-pop , with an ebullient bassline and staccato acoustic guitar . " Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic declared that " some of the highlights on the album are the silliest songs , " citing " Do You Wan na Come Over " 's " overheated flamenco chorus " as an example . Maura Johnston of '' Boston Globe '' said the song was one of the album 's high points , noting that the song " is jolted to life by the slashed guitars that helped make ' Toxic ' a pop thrill . " John Murphy of musicOMH was positive while noting that the track " has a rush and urgency about it which marks it out as one of the album 's best songs . " Nolan Feeney of '' Entertainment Weekly '' also picked it as a highlight , praising the " acoustic guitars and gurgling bass lines that make for one freaky pop experiment . " Alex Macpherson of '' The Guardian '' wrote that the song " takes the party back to Britney 's heyday , " praising the inclusion of the flamenco guitar . For '' Los Angeles Times '' writer Mikael Wood , the song " restore s some of the sonic invention that once defined Spears ' biggest hits . " Nick Levine , writing for '' NME '' , echoed the same thought , writing : " The lusty strut of ‘ Do You Wan na Come Over ? ’ nods to her early-noughties Neptunes-produced hits . " In his Vice column , Robert Christgau selected " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " and " Clumsy " as his favorite tracks on the album . Amy Mackelden of '' Bustle '' elaborated about the track : With a strong '90s vibe , an upbeat tempo , and a surprising rhythm , " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " utilizes the best of Spears ' talents . ... " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " embraces the current trend for songs that are musically complicated , that layer up their beats and sound effects , and feature multiple voices and infectious shouting during their choruses . Much like Hailee Steinfeld and Gwen Stefani 's latest offerings , " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is melodic , has a fast tempo , and is instantly recognizable . And most importantly , it 's fun . On August 18 , 2016 , Spears added " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " , as well as " Make Me ... " , to the setlist of her Las Vegas residency show Britney : Piece of Me . Later , on September 1 , 2016 , a performance of the song was broadcast from Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas for Today . During the performance , she used " an outfit similar to her risqué costume from 2016 's VMAs , while her backup dancers stood out in brightly-colored tank tops and shorts , " as reported by '' Entertainment Weekly '' Ruth Kinane . The song was also included in Spears 's setlist for the iHeartRadio Music Festival on September 24 , 2016 . Spears also performed it at I Heart Radio Jingle Ball , Triple Show and B26 Pepsi Jingle Bash during December 2016 . Also performed it at Apple Music Festival which was held in United Kingdom

		GOLD_MENTION=second shooting down
		CONTEXT=The second shooting down , on 12 February 1979 , killed all 59 on board . The real target of the second attack was General Peter Walls , head of the COMOPS ( Commander , Combined Operations ) , in charge of the Special Forces , including the SAS and the Selous Scouts . Due to the large number of tourists returning to Salisbury a second flight had been dispatched . General Walls received a boarding card for the second flight , which departed Kariba 15 minutes after the doomed aircraft . No one has been brought to trial or charged with shooting down the aircraft due to amnesty laws passed by both Smith and Mugabe . In a television interview not long after the attack on the first aircraft , Nkomo joked about the incident while admitting ZAPU had indeed been responsible . In his memoirs , '' Story of My Life '' , published in 1985 , Nkomo later said , " during that interview , the interviewee had asked about what we used to down the planes and I said stones , jokingly in an attempt to avoid answering the question due to military intelligence which demanded secrecy regarding what type of weapons we had acquired from the Soviet Union . They remembered the laugh and not the regret for the shooting down of both aircraft . " Nkomo founded the National Democratic Party ( NDP ) and in 1960 , the year British prime minister Harold Macmillan spoke of the " Wind of Change " blowing through Africa , Robert Mugabe joined him . The NDP was banned by the white minority government and it was subsequently replaced by the Zimbabwe African Peoples Union ( ZAPU ) , also founded by Nkomo , in 1962 , itself immediately banned . ZAPU split in 1963 and while some have claimed this split was due to ethnic tensions , more accurately the split was motivated by the failure of Sithole , Mugabe , Takawira and Malianga to wrest control of ZAPU from Nkomo . ZAPU would remain a multi-ethnic party right up until independence

		GOLD_MENTION=second shooting down
		CONTEXT=The second shooting down , on 12 February 1979 , killed all 59 on board . The real target of the second attack was General Peter Walls , head of the COMOPS ( Commander , Combined Operations ) , in charge of the Special Forces , including the SAS and the Selous Scouts . Due to the large number of tourists returning to Salisbury a second flight had been dispatched . General Walls received a boarding card for the second flight , which departed Kariba 15 minutes after the doomed aircraft . No one has been brought to trial or charged with shooting down the aircraft due to amnesty laws passed by both Smith and Mugabe . In a television interview not long after the attack on the first aircraft , Nkomo joked about the incident while admitting ZAPU had indeed been responsible . In his memoirs , '' Story of My Life '' , published in 1985 , Nkomo later said , " during that interview , the interviewee had asked about what we used to down the planes and I said stones , jokingly in an attempt to avoid answering the question due to military intelligence which demanded secrecy regarding what type of weapons we had acquired from the Soviet Union . They remembered the laugh and not the regret for the shooting down of both aircraft . " Nkomo founded the National Democratic Party ( NDP ) and in 1960 , the year British prime minister Harold Macmillan spoke of the " Wind of Change " blowing through Africa , Robert Mugabe joined him . The NDP was banned by the white minority government and it was subsequently replaced by the Zimbabwe African Peoples Union ( ZAPU ) , also founded by Nkomo , in 1962 , itself immediately banned . ZAPU split in 1963 and while some have claimed this split was due to ethnic tensions , more accurately the split was motivated by the failure of Sithole , Mugabe , Takawira and Malianga to wrest control of ZAPU from Nkomo . ZAPU would remain a multi-ethnic party right up until independence

Later , in September 2014 , Spears posted a picture of herself in the studio , hinting that she was recording new music . In another interview , a month later , she revealed that she was working " very slowly , but progressively " on the album . In 2015 , she released the song " Pretty Girls " with Iggy Azalea , however the song was met with moderate impact and Spears headed back to the studio to record more songs , but did n't have plans to release a new album . In November 2015 , Spears teased on her Instagram account that she was working with songwriters Justin Tranter and Julia Michaels , by posting a picture of them looking " bemused " with the caption : " Working hard and hardly working ... new album ... wheeeee ! . " A month later , Tranter gave an interview for website NewNowNext about his work with Spears and commented : " Working with Britney is a fucking dream . She is so sweet , so inspiring and a master on the mic . Me and Julia had to leave the studio one day because our screams of excitement after every take she did were distracting the producers . " In late 2016 , during interviews to promote the album , Spears declared that she wanted to explore new things on the record , and that it was her " most hip-hop album , " explaining : " ... there are like two or three songs that go in the direction of more urban that I 've wanted to do for a long time now , and I just have n't really done that . " In May 2016 , in an exclusive interview for website '' Breathe Heavy '' , Tranter revealed : " Nobody ever talks about Britney as a writer and she ’s f " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " was written by Mattias Larsson , Robin Fredriksson , Julia Michaels , Justin Tranter and Sandy Chila , with production being done by Mattman & Robin . Mattman & Robin were also responsible for programming , drums , percussion , snaps , handclaps , synths , guitars , bass and kalimba , while Michaels and Jermaine Jackson provided background vocals . It was recorded at 158 Studios , Westlake Village , California , The Studio at the Palms , Las Vegas , Nevada , and at Wolf Cousins Studios , Stockholm , Sweden . " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is an electropop , and dance-pop song that lasts for three minutes and twenty-two seconds ( 3:22 ) . It features " subtle keyboards , a strummed guitar , " and " wobbly bass " in its instrumentation . For Brian Josephs of '' Spin '' , the song 's guitar slaps " recall her 2001 single ' I 'm a Slave 4 U. ' " Other critics also felt that the " strummed flamenco guitar " on the song is similar to those on Justin Timberlake 's " Like I Love You " . Bianca Gracie of '' Fuse '' opined that the song reminded her of " the glory days ( no pun intended ) of ' Circus ' and ' Femme Fatale ' . " Lyrically , " Do You Wan na Come Over ? " is a flirty song about Spears " offer ing several reasons why her lover should come over and options , which can be seen in the lines " Nobody should be alone if they do n't have to be " and " I could get into that kissin ' and touchin ' / Or we could be good and do next to nothin ' . " Amy Roberts of '' Bustle '' noted that the lyrics are about hooking up , adding that they " celebrate the idea that casual relationships do n't need to be lacking respect or understanding . You do n't have to be in love with , or committing to , the person that you 're hooking up with , but that also does n't mean that you ca n't connect with them on a different level than just sex . In fact , Spears makes it clear that it 's kind of even cool if her hook-up does n't want to have sex . Her partner can draw the boundaries of where the massage she 's offering starts and ends , and if it remains as nothing more than a back rub then so be it – that 's totally cool . " For Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine , the song features " some dubious lyrics that seem to suggest masturbatory self-love " in the lines : " All I want is what you want/And all you want is me . " The chorus of the song features " a shouted gang " of backup singers , singing : " Whatever you want / whatever you need / I 'll do it ! . " Lewis Corner of Digital Spy called it " a thumping pop anthem , " praising " Britney 's seductive vocal delivery . " Gil Kaufman of '' Billboard '' named it a " fun , flirty " track . Bianca Gracie of '' Fuse '' described it as a " pulsating track that is a flirty booty call that is bound to own the dance floor .

" Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine called it " impeccably produced downstairs music , " adding that it " is an irresistible slice of dance-pop , with an ebullient bassline and staccato acoustic guitar . " Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic declared that " some of the highlights on the album are the silliest songs , " citing " Do You Wan na Come Over " 's " overheated flamenco chorus " as an example . Maura Johnston of '' Boston Globe '' said the song was one of the album 's high points , noting that the song " is jolted to life by the slashed guitars that helped make ' Toxic ' a pop thrill .

The song was also included in Spears 's setlist for the iHeartRadio Music Festival on September 24 , 2016 . Spears also performed it at I Heart Radio Jingle Ball , Triple Show and B26 Pepsi Jingle Bash during December 2016 . Also performed it at Apple Music Festival which was held in United Kingdom

		GOLD_MENTION=2014 World Music Awards
		CONTEXT=The album received mixed reviews from music critics . According to review aggregator Metacritic , the album has a score of 48/100 based on 8 reviews , indicating " mixed or average reviews " . On another aggregator website , Album of the Year , it holds the 4th position on a list of worst reviewed albums of 2014 . Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic gave the album 2.5 stars out of 5 saying that " Michele is not a natural pop star . This was true in 2009 when she debuted on '' Glee '' as Rachel Berry and it 's even clearer in 2014 . " Mike Ayers from '' Billboard '' gave a mostly positive review , saying , " Lyrically , '' Louder '' is rather one-sided , as she often sings about the perils of relationships , over and over , in ways that we 've all heard many times at this point . Still , it 's a solid effort that shows she has promise as a bonafide pop artist . " Sarah Rodman of '' The Boston Globe '' gave the album a mostly positive review , writing , " The Broadway veteran puts her mighty soprano through its paces on bouncy dance tracks , soaring ballads , and midtempo pop tunes where she straddles the line , mostly comfortably , between Katy Perry and Celine Dion . " Kyle Anderson of '' Entertainment Weekly '' gave the album a B - , writing , " It 's hard to be that mad at '' Louder '' , because it 's so admirably and lovingly crafted . There 's nothing wrong with Lea Michele 's debut , and that 's its biggest problem . While well curated and exquisitely executed , '' Louder '' is missing the visceral oomph that defines the gulf between superstars and the rest of the top 40 chum . " At '' USA Today '' , Jerry Shriver rated the album 2.5 stars out of four , and stated that " softer would have been a better approach . " He added that the song " Battlefield " points to a more promising direction . Kevin McFarland of '' The A.V. Club '' gave a C - rating , writing , " '' Louder '' , Michele 's debut solo album under her own name , does feature her distinctive talent as a vocalist . But the record is caught in an unfortunate stylistic limbo between fun-loving , youthful pop and the maturity of adult contemporary artists . " Jim Farber of the '' New York Daily News '' awarded the album two stars . He criticized , " Michele does n't so much sing as trumpet like an elephant eager for the charge . Her voice has more need than vulnerability , more anger than understanding . " Christopher R. Weingarten of '' Rolling Stone '' also gave a negative review , stating , " This album of insta-dated EDM-pop anthems and half-cocked bass drops probably wo n't help Michele 's cause . The songs about love 's ups and downs have a few memorable lyrics ( ' My heart 's too drunk to drive ' ) but not nearly enough . " '' Louder '' was nominated for World 's Best Album at the 2014 World Music Awards , held in Monaco on May 27 , 2014

Cyrus has performed the song during her ongoing Bangerz Tour . A critic from the '' Nashville Scene '' praised the performance , writing , " Wrecking Ball was sung by Miley and earnestly shouted in unison by the arena , some of the audience tearing up . " Blake Hannon praised Cyrus ' vocal delivery , writing , " The crowd kept going when things slowed down for Wrecking Ball . It was the highlight of the night , and not because of anything visual . The costumed characters vanished and the screen was black , with Cyrus belting out one of the best pop power ballads in recent memory with only a smattering of lights . It 's a reminder that beneath it all , Cyrus has a voice — and a pretty big one , at that . " In September 2013 , British singer-songwriter James Arthur covered " Wrecking Ball " on Radio Hamburg in Germany . Later that month , The Gregory Brothers released a country version , which Laura Vitto from Mashable felt " trades in Miley 's pop-ballad sound for a twangier feel .

Cyrus returned to perform the song during the musical festival on June 21 , 2014 , Summertime Ball at Wembley Stadium of London , in front of 80,000 people . Cyrus has performed the song during her ongoing Bangerz Tour . A critic from the '' Nashville Scene '' praised the performance , writing , " Wrecking Ball was sung by Miley and earnestly shouted in unison by the arena , some of the audience tearing up . " Blake Hannon praised Cyrus ' vocal delivery , writing , " The crowd kept going when things slowed down for Wrecking Ball . It was the highlight of the night , and not because of anything visual . The costumed characters vanished and the screen was black , with Cyrus belting out one of the best pop power ballads in recent memory with only a smattering of lights . It 's a reminder that beneath it all , Cyrus has a voice — and a pretty big one , at that . " In September 2013 , British singer-songwriter James Arthur covered " Wrecking Ball " on Radio Hamburg in Germany . Later that month , The Gregory Brothers released a country version , which Laura Vitto from Mashable felt " trades in Miley 's pop-ballad sound for a twangier feel . " American singer-songwriter Alonzo Holt released his own rendition in October , which featured vocals from Arthur ; it peaked at number 97 on the UK Singles Chart and number 71 on the Irish Singles Chart . Upstate New York alternative metal band Cry To The Blind released a cover of " Wrecking Ball " on December 11 , 2013 . American group Haim covered " Wrecking Ball " during their performance on BBC Radio 1 's Live Lounge , while the trio London Grammar sang it for the same session in December . Rumer Willis later sang the track during a performance which Chiderah Monde from '' Daily News '' felt " captured more of the emotion behind the song " than Cyrus ' version . American singer Rebecca Black uploaded an acoustic version to her YouTube channel in November . Canadian singer Sarah Blackwood of Walk Off the Earth also released an acoustic version

		ANSWER=Louder '' is missing the visceral oomph
		GOLD_MENTION=2014 World Music Awards
		CONTEXT=The album received mixed reviews from music critics . According to review aggregator Metacritic , the album has a score of 48/100 based on 8 reviews , indicating " mixed or average reviews " . On another aggregator website , Album of the Year , it holds the 4th position on a list of worst reviewed albums of 2014 . Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic gave the album 2.5 stars out of 5 saying that " Michele is not a natural pop star . This was true in 2009 when she debuted on '' Glee '' as Rachel Berry and it 's even clearer in 2014 . " Mike Ayers from '' Billboard '' gave a mostly positive review , saying , " Lyrically , '' Louder '' is rather one-sided , as she often sings about the perils of relationships , over and over , in ways that we 've all heard many times at this point . Still , it 's a solid effort that shows she has promise as a bonafide pop artist . " Sarah Rodman of '' The Boston Globe '' gave the album a mostly positive review , writing , " The Broadway veteran puts her mighty soprano through its paces on bouncy dance tracks , soaring ballads , and midtempo pop tunes where she straddles the line , mostly comfortably , between Katy Perry and Celine Dion . " Kyle Anderson of '' Entertainment Weekly '' gave the album a B - , writing , " It 's hard to be that mad at '' Louder '' , because it 's so admirably and lovingly crafted . There 's nothing wrong with Lea Michele 's debut , and that 's its biggest problem . While well curated and exquisitely executed , '' Louder '' is missing the visceral oomph that defines the gulf between superstars and the rest of the top 40 chum . " At '' USA Today '' , Jerry Shriver rated the album 2.5 stars out of four , and stated that " softer would have been a better approach . " He added that the song " Battlefield " points to a more promising direction . Kevin McFarland of '' The A.V. Club '' gave a C - rating , writing , " '' Louder '' , Michele 's debut solo album under her own name , does feature her distinctive talent as a vocalist . But the record is caught in an unfortunate stylistic limbo between fun-loving , youthful pop and the maturity of adult contemporary artists . " Jim Farber of the '' New York Daily News '' awarded the album two stars . He criticized , " Michele does n't so much sing as trumpet like an elephant eager for the charge . Her voice has more need than vulnerability , more anger than understanding . " Christopher R. Weingarten of '' Rolling Stone '' also gave a negative review , stating , " This album of insta-dated EDM-pop anthems and half-cocked bass drops probably wo n't help Michele 's cause . The songs about love 's ups and downs have a few memorable lyrics ( ' My heart 's too drunk to drive ' ) but not nearly enough . " '' Louder '' was nominated for World 's Best Album at the 2014 World Music Awards , held in Monaco on May 27 , 2014

The ceremony 's unusual date — a Monday night in late August — was due to two factors , primary being NBC 's commitment to '' Sunday Night Football '' ; since acquiring the National Football League 's Sunday night game package in 2006 , NBC , when it is their turn in the four-network rotation to air the Primetime Emmy Awards , usually schedules the ceremony for the Sunday before Labor Day weekend , to avoid conflicts with '' SNF '' in mid-September ( when ABC , CBS , or Fox normally air the ceremony ) . NBC 's ideal date on the 2014 calendar for the ceremony ( Sunday , August 24 ) led to the other scheduling factor — MTV 's Video Music Awards , which were set for that night more than a year in advance ( and would be staged in the L.A. area as well , at The Forum in Inglewood ) . On January 28 , 2014 , rather than go head-to-head with the VMA 's , NBC announced that the ceremony would take place on Monday , August 25 . The move would allow NBC to commit to a preseason '' Sunday Night Football '' broadcast for the 24th ( a game between the Cincinnati Bengals and Arizona Cardinals ) ; it also ensured the tradition of staging the Primetime Emmy Awards the weekend after the Creative Arts Emmy Awards ( that ceremony was already set for August 16 )

		CONTEXT=The ceremony was held on a night other than Sunday for the first time since 1976 ( the 28th Primetime Emmy Awards were also staged on a Monday that year , May 17 ) . The ceremony 's unusual date — a Monday night in late August — was due to two factors , primary being NBC 's commitment to '' Sunday Night Football '' ; since acquiring the National Football League 's Sunday night game package in 2006 , NBC , when it is their turn in the four-network rotation to air the Primetime Emmy Awards , usually schedules the ceremony for the Sunday before Labor Day weekend , to avoid conflicts with '' SNF '' in mid-September ( when ABC , CBS , or Fox normally air the ceremony ) . NBC 's ideal date on the 2014 calendar for the ceremony ( Sunday , August 24 ) led to the other scheduling factor — MTV 's Video Music Awards , which were set for that night more than a year in advance ( and would be staged in the L.A. area as well , at The Forum in Inglewood ) . On January 28 , 2014 , rather than go head-to-head with the VMA 's , NBC announced that the ceremony would take place on Monday , August 25 . The move would allow NBC to commit to a preseason '' Sunday Night Football '' broadcast for the 24th ( a game between the Cincinnati Bengals and Arizona Cardinals ) ; it also ensured the tradition of staging the Primetime Emmy Awards the weekend after the Creative Arts Emmy Awards ( that ceremony was already set for August 16 )

		CONTEXT=An episode of '' MTV Unplugged '' starring Cyrus premiered through MTV on January 29 , 2014 ; she performed an acoustic version of " Wrecking Ball " , among several additional tracks from '' Bangerz '' . On May 27 , 2014 Cyrus performed the song during the World Music Awards held in Monte Carlo , Monaco ; where she also won four World Music Awards . She wore a gown with a scenic theme based on flowers during the performance . It received positive reviews for its understated simplicity and strong vocal delivery . Cyrus returned to perform the song during the musical festival on June 21 , 2014 , Summertime Ball at Wembley Stadium of London , in front of 80,000 people . Cyrus has performed the song during her ongoing Bangerz Tour . A critic from the '' Nashville Scene '' praised the performance , writing , " Wrecking Ball was sung by Miley and earnestly shouted in unison by the arena , some of the audience tearing up . " Blake Hannon praised Cyrus ' vocal delivery , writing , " The crowd kept going when things slowed down for Wrecking Ball . It was the highlight of the night , and not because of anything visual . The costumed characters vanished and the screen was black , with Cyrus belting out one of the best pop power ballads in recent memory with only a smattering of lights . It 's a reminder that beneath it all , Cyrus has a voice — and a pretty big one , at that . " In September 2013 , British singer-songwriter James Arthur covered " Wrecking Ball " on Radio Hamburg in Germany . Later that month , The Gregory Brothers released a country version , which Laura Vitto from Mashable felt " trades in Miley 's pop-ballad sound for a twangier feel .

		ANSWER=The Tiber Apollo
		GOLD_MENTION=
		CONTEXT=The Tiber Apollo is an over lifesize marble sculpture of Apollo , a Hadrianic or Antonine Roman marble copy after a bronze Greek original of about 450 BCE . Dredged from the bed of the Tiber in Rome , in making piers for the Ponte Garibaldi ( 1885 , bridge completed 1888 ) , it is conserved in the Museo Nazionale Romano in Palazzo Massimo alle Terme , Rome . The style of the sculpture reflects the school of Phidias , perhaps the young Phidias himself , as Jiří Frel suggested , and Kenneth Clark observed of it , " If only this figure , instead of the Apollo Belvedere , had been known to Winckelmann , his insight and beautiful gift of literary re-creation would have been better supported by the sculptural qualities of his subject . " Of this marble Brian A. Sparkes reminds us that " the general effect of copies always tends towards sweetness , and so it is here . "

		ANSWER=United States
		GOLD_MENTION=Raid of the Ghetto of Rome
		CONTEXT=The first task was to divide the 20,000 photographic negatives into three separate collections named Classical Archaeology , Medieval and Modern Times , and Ethnographic Missions . Then she and her colleagues , archaeologist Filippo Magi and the art historian Deoclecio Redig de Campos , began to classify the images , and deal with the constant flow of incoming new photographs . In 1935 , the Marchese Benedetto Guglielmo donated a private Etruscan art collection to Pope Pius XI . Speier was assigned to organize the collection . Of particular importance , she established two halls with 17 original Greek sculptures from the collection and worked on the Roman refurbishment of the Greek vase collection and the Antiquarium . During the mid-1930s , Speier spent considerable time in Germany traveling annually to visit her family . In 1937 , her letters to her lover , Italian General , airship pioneer and Arctic explorer Umberto Nobile , indicated that she was in Frankfurt for an extended period , and then in 1938 , she spent time in Basel and Geneva before returning to Frankfurt . Hitler 's first meeting with Mussolini took place in Rome in May 1938 , but Speier was not back in Rome until July . Then in September , she was in the Tuscan town of Chianciano Terme . Pope Pius XI died on 10 February , 1939 and Speier converted to Catholicism later that year with Pope Pius XII immediately renewing her employment . Although she was intensely occupied with her work at the Vatican , she often considered emigrating to the United States , where her mother and sister lived , or to Brazil . During this early period of his papacy , Pius XII granted 3,000 visas to Jews , if they had been baptized , to emigrate to Brazil , though the only evidence found linking Speier and Pius XII at this time was , in her correspondence , his congratulatory telegram on her conversion . Throughout 1939 and 1940 , Nobile was in the United States and Speier remained in Rome until the summer of 1940 , when she took a retreat to Chianciano . After 1940 , correspondence between the two was sparse as they feared censors and writing had become increasingly impractical . Nobile returned to Rome in May 1942 and her family severed communication with Speier after learning of her Catholic baptism , effectively ending her reasons for emigration . During the German occupation of Rome 1943/1944 Pope Pius XII made arrangements for Giulio Belvederi , nephew of the former Pontifical Master of Ceremonies Pietro Respighi , to hide Speier in the Catacombs of St. Priscilla , under the nunnery . Hiding in the catacombs saved Speier from the Raid of the Ghetto of Rome on 16 October 1943 in which more than 1,000 Jews were deported to Auschwitz and all save 16 were killed . During this part of the war , the Museum was closed , until the end of September 1944 , and many artworks from war-torn areas were shipped to the Vatican for storage . When it reopened , she continued with her work creating a detailed monuments inventory of the Vatican holdings , which resulted in several important finds . In 1946 , in an antiquities storage facility , she found a horse head sculpted by Phidias which was originally from one of the pediments of the Parthenon . On further examination , it was established from its weathering that it was in fact the second horse of Athena 's chariot on the western gable , where the dispute between Athena and Poseidon over the land of Attica is depicted . Speier also discovered the two so-called ancient Aurai statues that decorated the exterior of the Sala Rotonda when it was built in the 18th century . She published '' Die Skulpturen des Vaticanischen Museums '' ( The Sculptures of the Vatican Museums ) in 1956 about the find of the Parthenon horse 's head , and earlier in 1950 had published a distinguished report concerning the excavations of St. Peter 's Basilica in Herbig 's '' Vermächtnis der Antiken Kunst '' ( Legacy of Ancient Art ) entitled " Die neuen Ausgrabungen unter der Peterskirche in Rom "

		GOLD_MENTION=1934 Pahiatua earthquake
		CONTEXT=The region had already experienced several large earthquakes , the very large 1855 Wairarapa Earthquake , and the 1934 Pahiatua earthquake in the Northern Wairarapa . The 1855 earthquake occurred on the Wairarapa Fault which is part of the North Island Fault System . At 11.16 pm a small and sharp but brief earthquake of magnitude 7.2 Ms ( Mw 6.9-7.2 ) shook a wide area in the lower North Island from Eketahuna to Masterton , Featherston and Wellington ; and was noticed from Auckland to near Dunedin . The main earthquake was of 7.2 Ms and the epicentre was near Masterton and 12 km deep . The quake lasted for over a minute and had been preceded by a foreshock three hours earlier at 8.15 pm . Many buildings in Masterton were damaged . The mayor Thomas Jordan declared a state of emergency and got troops to patrol the town . There was considerable damage in Palmerston North . In Wellington twenty thousand chimneys fell , and there was one death in the suburb of Kelburn when a 70-year old retired chemist Hedley Victor Evens ( sic ) was killed by coal gas from a fractured pipe . Some downtown pediments were damaged , but some had already been removed after the 1931 Hawke 's Bay earthquake . The city engineer K. E . Luke held that damage was less severe as the quake ended swiftly . Another shock in the area struck on 2nd August at 12.34 am , preceded by a foreshock on the late afternoon of the 1st . This was of magnitude 7.0 Ms ( Mw 6.8 ) or slightly less than the earlier quake . The epicentre was 40 km deep and at location 41.01 ° S and 175.52 ° E. Wairarapa except for Eketahuna did not suffer as badly , though in Masterton the June damage was exacerbated . The 2 August aftershock was followed by a third severe aftershock on 2 December , with about 600 aftershocks recorded to the end of the year . Repairs from the first quake were not completed , and the mortar for some repairs had not properly set . Some buildings weakened in June suffered further damage , though it was sometimes hard to tell if further damage had occurred . In Masterton many buildings were badly damaged by the first quake ; the fire station , the Bank of New Zealand , several shops and St Matthews Church ( which was later blown up by the Army ) . The Waiohine road bridge was badly sunken and was closed . After the second quake the Wairarapa Farmers Co-op building partly collapsed . In Wellington the first quake toppled some twenty thousand chimneys . In August there was serious damage in the Willis Street – Manners Street area to three buildings : Charles Begg 's music shop , the Duke of Edinburgh Hotel , and the Regent Hotel

		CONTEXT=The pattern of displacement along the Imperial Fault was very similar to that observed for the northern part of the rupture during the 1940 El Centro earthquake , although on this occasion the rupture did not extend across the border into Mexico . This had been explained as the behavior of individual slip patches along the Imperial Fault with two patches rupturing in 1940 and only the northern one in 1979 . The faulting that gave rise to the earthquake has been modeled by comparing synthetic seismograms with near-source strong motion recordings . This analysis showed that the rupture speed had at times exceeded the shear wave velocity , making this the first earthquake for which supershear rupture was inferred

		ANSWER=1930s
		GOLD_MENTION=criminal trials of the 1930s
		CONTEXT=According to the ITAR-TASS news agency , the prosecution stated that Khabarov 's group planned to launch an operation codenamed “ Dawn ” to overthrow official authorities in the region . Many prominent figures in Russian politics expressed outrage about Khabarov 's imprisonment . Among them are individuals with diametrically opposed political views such as the presidential candidates Leonid Ivashov and Gennady Zyuganov , as well as other political figures , such as Andrey Illarionov , Andrey Savelyev , Maxim Shevchenko , Alexey Dymovsky , Maxim Kalashnikov , Irek Murtazin , Mikhail Delyagin , Ashot Egiazaryan , Aleksandr Kharchikov , Dmitry Puchkov , '' et al. '' They said that the accusations do not hold water , pointing to the ridiculousness of the collected “ evidence ” against Khabarov . Khabarov 's colleague , Col. Vladislav Zyomkovsky , said during an interview with '' PublicPost '' , that officially announced denunciation of a failed masterplan doesn ′ t stand up to critical examination , and if examined , the argument simply falls to the ground . In his opinion , a brilliant military strategist such as Khabarov , would never develop such an obvious plan . To refute the official version of the failed plot , Zyomkovsky cited one paragraph from Khabarov 's bill of indictment , which states that Khabarov and his alleged accomplices planned to switch off the entire region 's electrical grid , and thus create panic and civil disorder . In his opinion , this passage was copypasted from an indictment of the criminal trials of the 1930s , when such an event would really have spread chaos . But in the 2000s in Russia , electrical outages happened on a daily basis , were routine and a quite common occurrence

She wore a gown with a scenic theme based on flowers during the performance . It received positive reviews for its understated simplicity and strong vocal delivery . Cyrus returned to perform the song during the musical festival on June 21 , 2014 , Summertime Ball at Wembley Stadium of London , in front of 80,000 people . Cyrus has performed the song during her ongoing Bangerz Tour . A critic from the '' Nashville Scene '' praised the performance , writing , " Wrecking Ball was sung by Miley and earnestly shouted in unison by the arena , some of the audience tearing up . " Blake Hannon praised Cyrus ' vocal delivery , writing , " The crowd kept going when things slowed down for Wrecking Ball . It was the highlight of the night , and not because of anything visual . The costumed characters vanished and the screen was black , with Cyrus belting out one of the best pop power ballads in recent memory with only a smattering of lights . It 's a reminder that beneath it all , Cyrus has a voice — and a pretty big one , at that . " In September 2013 , British singer-songwriter James Arthur covered " Wrecking Ball " on Radio Hamburg in Germany . Later that month , The Gregory Brothers released a country version , which Laura Vitto from Mashable felt " trades in Miley 's pop-ballad sound for a twangier feel .

		CONTEXT=Shapiro was a founder of the Cannes Film Festival , and allowed Raimi to screen the film at the 1982 festival out of competition . Stephen King was present at its screening and gave the film a rave review . '' USA Today '' released an article about King 's favorite horror films ; the author cited '' The Evil Dead '' as his fifth favorite film of the genre . The film severely affected King , who commented that while watching the film at Cannes , he was " registering things he had never seen in a movie before " . He became one of the film 's largest supporters during the early efforts to find a distributor , eventually describing it as the " most ferociously original film of the year " , a quote used in the film 's promotional pieces . King 's comments attracted the interest of critics , who otherwise would likely have dismissed the low-budget thriller

		ANSWER=R.D. Reid said : " I think this film is about the attempt to deal with a deep-rooted despair
		GOLD_MENTION=35th annual Toronto International Film Festival
		CONTEXT=Though it is never explicitly invoked , '' You Are Here '' is primarily about the Internet and the information society . At a festival question-and-answer session in Utrecht , Cockburn said the film comes from anxieties and feelings " that are very specifc to the current digital age " . In an interview with Adam Nayman , who notes that Cockburn 's previous short pieces carry a recurrent theme of technophobia , Cockburn said he wanted to make a movie that expressed anxiety about a world where mapping and archiving the world is more substantial than the world itself : " Photography or video is already one step removed from reality . The second step away from reality is : how is it stored , how is it findable ? There 's the world , there 's pictures of the world , and there 's this multitude of search engines that you can use . " In a similar vein , Cockburn , said the film is all about " location , or at least talking around the idea of location ... the non-specificity of place ... closely connected to the anxiety and uncertainty-of - selfhood that I hope is somewhere near the movie 's heart . " In an interview with John Semley , Cockburn acknowledges Jorge Luis Borges as an influence on '' You Are Here '' , in particular , " where he talks about imagining the path that someone travels in their life and how if you could see that path it might somehow form a shape " , that is , a trace " that no person will ever be able to know or see or understand . " That idea is structurally the heart of the movie , but it 's also key to the emotional resonance . All the characters are struggling to come to terms with the fact that they ca n't know the bigger picture of the universe they ’re living in . They ca n't know how they relate to the other pieces . They ca n’t see the traces they are leaving . Cockburn has related how , at the 35th annual Toronto International Film Festival , in response to someone asking the actors what they thought the movie was about , most of the actors having just seen it for the first time , R.D. Reid said : " I think this film is about the attempt to deal with a deep-rooted despair " , which surprised Cockburn , since they had not talked about it : " I was really gratified to hear him say that . I thought that is a very appropriate interpretation of the movie . " In the same exchange , Cockburn also noted : " A couple of people have written about it being hopeful , which I 'll accept . " In his interview with Cockburn , Adam Nayman argued that the film was hopeful " insofar as it urges the viewer to simply take stock of his and her reality and act accordingly , " to which Cockburn replied : " It 's gratifying to hear it positioned that way . " In a number of interviews , Cockburn has said that '' You Are Here '' is ultimately related to a period when he went through a paranoid-delusional breakdown : " everything I saw , read , and heard was some sort of message to me that needed to be decoded . " It was a period of " intense meaning-making ... I 'd be looking at any text I 'd encounter like a menu or road sign and I 'd scramble the letters around and see if there were any different codes there that needed to be deciphered . " After a long time , he realized that this behaviour , which was emotionally exhausting and troubling , had emotional underpinnings : " It became something that was n't just an enjoyable intellectual play . ... In a number of ways I worked through it , and part of that was figuring out what the emotional reasons were . " That experience " stayed " with him and worked its way into " just about everything " he wrote or directed : '' You Are Here '' is a compendium of characters dealing with the question of whether their life is just a series of random events , or whether there ’s some " Great Code " at the heart of it all . It 's a cerebral concept , but when you 're in the middle of it , it 's scary and exciting and sometimes even funny , and that , for me , is the heart of the movie . Cockburn 's literary influences for '' You Are Here '' include Paul Auster and especially Jorge Luis Borges . His film influences include the directors Todd Haynes ( '' Poison '' and '' I 'm Not There '' in particular ) , " for how he plays with film language with multiple styles in one movie , or the same character being played by multiple actors " , and Charlie Kaufman ( '' Synecdoche , New York '' ) , which " came out just as we were beginning to cut '' You Are Here '' " . The film was a Rosetta Stone of sorts , " in its willingness to seriously mess around with the supposed rules of filmmaking and storytelling , but ultimately being a comprehensible and moving experience that hits you on levels you did n’t even know you had . " It gave Cockburn a lot of hope for his own film

		GOLD_MENTION=1992 Eurovision Song Contest
		CONTEXT=Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny appears at his back door in his boxers and invites viewers for a look around his house ; including a ( now fully dressed ) encounter with his karaoke machine . He then sets off on his bicycle for an interview at RTÉ . Alas his attempts to get there unscathed come undone when his bike receives a puncture and he has to resort to queueing for a bus like the common person . When the bus arrives , he realises he has no money but after asking for some spare cash from an innocent bystander , he turns around to find the bus has pulled off again . In the RTÉ carpark , Pat Kenny sits in his car , casting his eyes over his fellow broadcasters and enviously longing to join them in their casual conversation . When he finally plucks up the courage to approach Marian Finucane and Joe Duffy , the latter is overheard insulting him and Pat heads back to his car . With Pat due on air in ten minutes , Tom decides to join him in the passenger seat but he must first overcome the clutches of George Hook , who once again attempts to lure him to Newstalk . Pat asks Tom what the world really thinks of him , believing that his assistant is the only person in the world who is loyal to him . Tom attempts to avoid the question , distracting Pat by ( wrongly ) telling him that Enda Kenny has just arrived . Eventually Tom opts to tell Pat , albeit with much hesitation , that he is '' " absolutely unbelievable " '' . At that moment Enda Kenny finally arrives at the studio , still in his biker gear and collapses with exhaustion on the steps having raced through Dublin to make the interview on schedule . Kenny and Kenny square off on air and , with Pat faced with an adversary so similar in perceived personality , popularity and name he is even more unable to cope with his feelings of unworthiness than usual . Pat breaks down live on air , mistaking Enda 's rival , Taoiseach Bertie Ahern , for his own rival , '' Liveline '' presenter Joe Duffy . This prompts Enda to join him in his moment of unrelenting emotion . The next morning Tom arrives at Pat 's house . Pat assumes he has come with his P45 or details of who is to take over the mantle of the station 's highest earning broadcaster . However Tom merely points to two giant sacks of complimentary mail he has carried on his bike from RTÉ headquarters . One of them even wants to sleep with the presenter , who quickly places the letter in the left front pocket of his dressing gown . Pat is astounded to discover he is all over the news and that celebrities such as 1992 Eurovision Song Contest winner Linda Martin , music mogul Louis Walsh and Boyzone lead singer Ronan Keating are talking about him . He hurries indoors to switch on his television . There he finds that figures from the worlds of sport and politics including Irish national football team manager Steve Staunton , Ireland rugby manager Eddie O'Sullivan and Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams are lining up in their droves to pay tribute to him . He is intrigued to find Fintan O'Toole has also spoken greatly of him but becomes irritated when he finds that Steve Staunton seems to have taken over the airwaves , typically reiterating how Pat has done a great job , how he works for the team , has delivered a great result and what else can you say . Meanwhile , Bertie Ahern repeatedly rings Tom 's mobile to request an interview with Pat , but on each occasion Tom tells him to ring back later . Pat and Tom stroll into RTÉ , where George Hook is astounded to hear of Pat 's newfound popularity . He is adamant that Tom will soon join him at Newstalk but Tom shows his unswaying loyalty by declaring he will go only where Pat goes . On Friday night George slips into RTÉ and just as an episode of '' The Late Late Show '' is coming to a close , approaches Pat 's dressing room . George is inadvertently knocked to the floor by a stray microphone where he lies moaning until Pat emerges from the dressing room . Pat steps over George and leaves RTÉ with Tom , telling his assistant that he should not allow anyone to undermine him before demanding that he open the door

		CONTEXT=On January 27 , 2011 the festival sent 9 filmmakers to 9 cities across the US to screen and discuss their films . The cities and films included : Bob Tourtellotte of Reuters wrote " Sundance 2011 has proven to be exceptionally strong , audiences and filmmakers seem to agree . " Tourtellotte reported that Robert Redford said that three years ago the Sundance Institute " set out to get back to its roots of supporting alternative voices in cinema and he felt like this year that strategy paid off . " Redford said " This year , what has excited me , is I think the quality is increasing in diversity and is increasing in depth . " The AP reported that Redford said it 's " always a relief " when the festival ends because " it 's really exhausting . " Kenneth Turan , film critic for the '' Los Angeles Times '' , wrote " though the festival has gotten ever bigger — and ( thankfully ) more efficient in moving its close to 50,000 attendees in and out of its far-flung theaters — it still retains the scrappy , antic spirit that has animated it from the start . " Turan wrote " One of the paradoxes of Sundance is that the quirkiness and charm around the edges of the festival are not always fully appreciated because so much of the media focus is on the premieres section and the U.S. dramatic competition " which he said " are , frankly , often the weakest parts of the festival . " Turan said " Sundance 's insistence on giving equal weight to documentaries and dramas has made it into as important a nonfiction showcase as any festival in the world ; witness the fact that four out of the five Oscar-nominated docs this year debuted at Sundance last January . " He also wrote that the foreign language film competition " is a strength at Sundance , and yet that field is given even less popular attention than the documentaries . " Peter Knegt wrote that this year 's festival " probably wo n't replicate last year 's Oscar record . " He said " Despite a huge surge in sales , this year 's Sundance slate looks like it might be the least Oscar-friendly in some time . " He noted that the U.S. Dramatic Grand Jury Prize winners have been nominated for Best Picture for two years ( referring to '' Precious '' and '' Winter 's Bone '' ) . Knegt speculated on films that might be nominated for the Oscars . Films he deemed " most likely to succeed " at being nominated included : '' Like Crazy '' for Best Picture , Michael Shannon of '' Take Shelter '' for Best Actor , Elizabeth Olsen of '' Martha Marcy May Marlene '' for Best Actress , Felicity Jones of '' Like Crazy '' for Best Actress , Jessica Chastain of '' Take Shelter '' for Best Supporting Actress , '' Project Nim '' for Best Documentary Feature , '' Page One '' for Best Documentary Feature , and '' The Interrupters '' for Best Documentary Feature . He wrote " It 's reasonable to feel assured that at least one of Sundance 's docs will end up an Oscar nominee , if not two , three or four . " Jada Yuan of '' New York '' magazine wrote " perhaps the biggest highlight of the festival is just how ripe it 's been for acquisitions , with nearly 30 films getting picked up , the most at any Sundance ever . " On " why everyone is suddenly so bullish on independent film " , Owen Gleiberman wrote that the " energy and optimism at Sundance this year was n't just hype . " He said the factors he thought were driving a new evolving vision of the indie film world included : " The deals have n’t gotten cheaper — they 've gotten smarter " , a belief that last year 's new festival director John Cooper and director of programming Trevor Groth " have re-energized the festival , heightening its quality and organizing the movies with a tempting new shape and vision " , video on demand gives distributors a safety net and more confidence , and the audiences for Sundance movies are not going away , saying " The Oscars ... have become a testament to the central place that Sundance movies now occupy . " Redford was happy about the success of the festival , with about 45 films being sold vs 14 in 2010 , an increase of about 220 % . Redford said studios are realizing " there are audiences " for indie films

" Todd McCarthy in his review for '' The Hollywood Reporter '' called the film " A work of rigorously disciplined eccentricity , Kumiko , the Treasure Hunter is at once entirely accessible and yet appealing only to a rarified crowd ready to key into its narrow-bandwidth sense of humor . " Eric Kohn of '' Indiewire '' praised the film and said that " Striking a complex tone of tragedy and uplift at the same time , '' Kumiko , the Treasure Hunter '' both celebrates the escapist power of personal fantasies and bears witness to their dangerous extremes . It 's the rare case of a story that 's inspirational and devastating at once . " David Ehrlich of ''Film.com '' gave the film 9.1 out of 10 and said that " Less of an homage to '' Fargo '' than the next appendage of the same exquisite corpse , '' Kumiko , the Treasure Hunter '' plays like a dryly hilarious riff on '' Do n't Look Now '' " but ultimately said that " it 's one of the best films to ever premiere at Sundance . " The film went on to be nominated for two Independent Spirit Awards : Best Director and Best Female Lead . For his work on '' Kumiko '' and other films , Producer Chris Ohlson received the Spirit Award 's Piaget Producers Award

		CONTEXT=On January 27 , 2011 the festival sent 9 filmmakers to 9 cities across the US to screen and discuss their films . The cities and films included : Bob Tourtellotte of Reuters wrote " Sundance 2011 has proven to be exceptionally strong , audiences and filmmakers seem to agree . " Tourtellotte reported that Robert Redford said that three years ago the Sundance Institute " set out to get back to its roots of supporting alternative voices in cinema and he felt like this year that strategy paid off . " Redford said " This year , what has excited me , is I think the quality is increasing in diversity and is increasing in depth . " The AP reported that Redford said it 's " always a relief " when the festival ends because " it 's really exhausting . " Kenneth Turan , film critic for the '' Los Angeles Times '' , wrote " though the festival has gotten ever bigger — and ( thankfully ) more efficient in moving its close to 50,000 attendees in and out of its far-flung theaters — it still retains the scrappy , antic spirit that has animated it from the start . " Turan wrote " One of the paradoxes of Sundance is that the quirkiness and charm around the edges of the festival are not always fully appreciated because so much of the media focus is on the premieres section and the U.S. dramatic competition " which he said " are , frankly , often the weakest parts of the festival . " Turan said " Sundance 's insistence on giving equal weight to documentaries and dramas has made it into as important a nonfiction showcase as any festival in the world ; witness the fact that four out of the five Oscar-nominated docs this year debuted at Sundance last January . " He also wrote that the foreign language film competition " is a strength at Sundance , and yet that field is given even less popular attention than the documentaries . " Peter Knegt wrote that this year 's festival " probably wo n't replicate last year 's Oscar record . " He said " Despite a huge surge in sales , this year 's Sundance slate looks like it might be the least Oscar-friendly in some time . " He noted that the U.S. Dramatic Grand Jury Prize winners have been nominated for Best Picture for two years ( referring to '' Precious '' and '' Winter 's Bone '' ) . Knegt speculated on films that might be nominated for the Oscars . Films he deemed " most likely to succeed " at being nominated included : '' Like Crazy '' for Best Picture , Michael Shannon of '' Take Shelter '' for Best Actor , Elizabeth Olsen of '' Martha Marcy May Marlene '' for Best Actress , Felicity Jones of '' Like Crazy '' for Best Actress , Jessica Chastain of '' Take Shelter '' for Best Supporting Actress , '' Project Nim '' for Best Documentary Feature , '' Page One '' for Best Documentary Feature , and '' The Interrupters '' for Best Documentary Feature . He wrote " It 's reasonable to feel assured that at least one of Sundance 's docs will end up an Oscar nominee , if not two , three or four . " Jada Yuan of '' New York '' magazine wrote " perhaps the biggest highlight of the festival is just how ripe it 's been for acquisitions , with nearly 30 films getting picked up , the most at any Sundance ever . " On " why everyone is suddenly so bullish on independent film " , Owen Gleiberman wrote that the " energy and optimism at Sundance this year was n't just hype . " He said the factors he thought were driving a new evolving vision of the indie film world included : " The deals have n’t gotten cheaper — they 've gotten smarter " , a belief that last year 's new festival director John Cooper and director of programming Trevor Groth " have re-energized the festival , heightening its quality and organizing the movies with a tempting new shape and vision " , video on demand gives distributors a safety net and more confidence , and the audiences for Sundance movies are not going away , saying " The Oscars ... have become a testament to the central place that Sundance movies now occupy . " Redford was happy about the success of the festival , with about 45 films being sold vs 14 in 2010 , an increase of about 220 % . Redford said studios are realizing " there are audiences " for indie films

		ANSWER=Jennifer Garner
		GOLD_MENTION=MTV Movie Award
		CONTEXT=Elvis Mitchell of '' The New York Times '' wrote : " The performances give the movie more flavor and life than the situation does ; it often feels like prechewed Bubble Yum . The message of the plot is that a lack of sophistication is the key to success , even at a fashion magazine that attracts readers through sexy exhibitionism . The movie would have shown some daring savvy if it had played more with the role-playing aspect of fashion spreads . Instead it is content to eat its retro snack cake and have it , too . " Andrea Gronvall of the '' Chicago Reader '' wrote that " The formula works , thanks in large part to star Jennifer Garner , who 's so radiant theaters should be stocking sunblock . Underlying the shenanigans and the pop-psychology moral — self-love is a prerequisite for true love — there 's a touching wistfulness about roads not taken . " Jorge Morales of '' The Village Voice '' commented : " The thirtysomething in me was all , gag me with a spoon , but the kid in me was like , this movie 's rad to the max . " Garner was nominated for MTV Movie Award and Teen Choice awards for her role as Jenna Rink

		ANSWER=Sundance
		GOLD_MENTION=Sundance last January
		CONTEXT=On January 27 , 2011 the festival sent 9 filmmakers to 9 cities across the US to screen and discuss their films . The cities and films included : Bob Tourtellotte of Reuters wrote " Sundance 2011 has proven to be exceptionally strong , audiences and filmmakers seem to agree . " Tourtellotte reported that Robert Redford said that three years ago the Sundance Institute " set out to get back to its roots of supporting alternative voices in cinema and he felt like this year that strategy paid off . " Redford said " This year , what has excited me , is I think the quality is increasing in diversity and is increasing in depth . " The AP reported that Redford said it 's " always a relief " when the festival ends because " it 's really exhausting . " Kenneth Turan , film critic for the '' Los Angeles Times '' , wrote " though the festival has gotten ever bigger — and ( thankfully ) more efficient in moving its close to 50,000 attendees in and out of its far-flung theaters — it still retains the scrappy , antic spirit that has animated it from the start . " Turan wrote " One of the paradoxes of Sundance is that the quirkiness and charm around the edges of the festival are not always fully appreciated because so much of the media focus is on the premieres section and the U.S. dramatic competition " which he said " are , frankly , often the weakest parts of the festival . " Turan said " Sundance 's insistence on giving equal weight to documentaries and dramas has made it into as important a nonfiction showcase as any festival in the world ; witness the fact that four out of the five Oscar-nominated docs this year debuted at Sundance last January . " He also wrote that the foreign language film competition " is a strength at Sundance , and yet that field is given even less popular attention than the documentaries . " Peter Knegt wrote that this year 's festival " probably wo n't replicate last year 's Oscar record . " He said " Despite a huge surge in sales , this year 's Sundance slate looks like it might be the least Oscar-friendly in some time . " He noted that the U.S. Dramatic Grand Jury Prize winners have been nominated for Best Picture for two years ( referring to '' Precious '' and '' Winter 's Bone '' ) . Knegt speculated on films that might be nominated for the Oscars . Films he deemed " most likely to succeed " at being nominated included : '' Like Crazy '' for Best Picture , Michael Shannon of '' Take Shelter '' for Best Actor , Elizabeth Olsen of '' Martha Marcy May Marlene '' for Best Actress , Felicity Jones of '' Like Crazy '' for Best Actress , Jessica Chastain of '' Take Shelter '' for Best Supporting Actress , '' Project Nim '' for Best Documentary Feature , '' Page One '' for Best Documentary Feature , and '' The Interrupters '' for Best Documentary Feature . He wrote " It 's reasonable to feel assured that at least one of Sundance 's docs will end up an Oscar nominee , if not two , three or four . " Jada Yuan of '' New York '' magazine wrote " perhaps the biggest highlight of the festival is just how ripe it 's been for acquisitions , with nearly 30 films getting picked up , the most at any Sundance ever . " On " why everyone is suddenly so bullish on independent film " , Owen Gleiberman wrote that the " energy and optimism at Sundance this year was n't just hype . " He said the factors he thought were driving a new evolving vision of the indie film world included : " The deals have n’t gotten cheaper — they 've gotten smarter " , a belief that last year 's new festival director John Cooper and director of programming Trevor Groth " have re-energized the festival , heightening its quality and organizing the movies with a tempting new shape and vision " , video on demand gives distributors a safety net and more confidence , and the audiences for Sundance movies are not going away , saying " The Oscars ... have become a testament to the central place that Sundance movies now occupy . " Redford was happy about the success of the festival , with about 45 films being sold vs 14 in 2010 , an increase of about 220 % . Redford said studios are realizing " there are audiences " for indie films
