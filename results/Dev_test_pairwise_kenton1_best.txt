QUERY_ANSWERS={'1977 flood', 'Johnstown Flood of 1977', 'massive flood'}
QUERY_CONTEXT=The flood was preceded by rains from March 9 that did not stop until March 22 , 1936 . The storms brought warmer 50 °F ( 10 °C ) weather that was a cause of one stage of flooding and the continuous rains a second cause of flooding . The natural run-off of 1 to 3 inches ( 2.5 to 7.5 cm ) was far surpassed by the deluge of from 10 to 30 inches ( 25 to 75 cm ) of water in the region . The flood came before pending flood control legislation was enacted or any significant flood control measures implemented . The narrowness of the valleys and encroachment of buildings on the river banks contributed to record flooding . By the time nightfall came one-third of the city was under of water and by the time flooding was over twenty-five people lost their lives . The damages , estimated at $ 43 million , made it the worst flood since the flood of 1889 and the event is chronicled at the Johnstown Flood Museum After the flood , sweeping nationwide flood control laws were enacted and from 1938 to 1943 Johnstown saw many projects completed . These measures gave the people the feeling that the area was now " flood free " , and it was touted as such until the flood of 1977

		CONTEXT=In 1977 the Board of Governors of the World Bank approved Bura Irrigation and Settlement Project ( BISP ) in Kenya . The project area is situated just South of the Equator in the Lower Tana Basin . It lies on the west bank of the Tana River and falls within the administrative area of Tana River County . The project was an ambitious attempt of the government of Kenya , the World Bank and a few other donors to develop a remote area , create employment for thousands of people with a reasonable income and earn foreign exchange . Bura project would develop about 6,700 net irrigated ha over a 5 1/2 year period and settle on smallholdings about 5,150 landless poor families selected from all parts of Kenya . Physical and social infrastructure would be provided to support the settler and satellite population , expected to reach a total of 65,000 persons by 1985 . The total cost of the project was estimated at 92 million dollars in 1977 prices . Actual construction started in 1978 . During implementation the costs exploded from $ 17,500 / = per family to $ 55,000 / = , a new record for the World Bank . The largest cost increase was for the irrigation network ( 615 % ) . The donors were not willing and the government was not able to raise the additional funds and subsequently the size of the project was scaled down from 6,700 ha to 3,900 and later to 2,500 ha , although the irrigation structures were completed for 6,700 ha . In this period 2,100 landless households from all over Kenya were settled in the scheme . They were allocated two plots of 0.625 ha and a garden of 0.05 ha . Each year they were to grow 1.25 ha cotton and 0.625 maize intercropped with cowpeas . Soon it was evident that the project would fail to achieve its objectives . Job creation was only 40 % of the target , the economic rate of return was negative and the annual operating and maintenance costs exceeded the benefits . Even with net farm incomes of about 40 % of the appraisal estimates in real terms , annual government subsidies amounted to about 1,000 dollars per settler . The project had an unreliable water supply and many buildings had foundation problems . After cotton crop failures due to pests in 1990 the project came virtually to a standstill as the management lacked the funds to finance cotton and maize crops . Most settlers deserted and the only the ones with nowhere to go remained in the scheme , living on famine relief and odd jobs . In the period 1993 - 2005 a number of times the government tried to revive a number of timesthe project , but all in vain . After 2005 , rehabilitation and crop growing started in phases and since 2009 - 10 the tenants have been growing crops , although the cropping pattern comed down to no more than 50 % of the projected crop intensity and the settlers have low incomes , if any . This is partly caused by the fact that the original cash crop , cotton , is no longer a profitable crop .

		CONTEXT=The Fred A. Perley House is a historic house located in Jenningston , West Virginia . Fred A. Perley , one of the founders of Perley & Crockett Lumber Company , built the house circa 1907 . Perley , who was trained as an engineer , designed the house and oversaw its construction . The house has a rustic design with hemlock bark siding , a style which was most likely chosen to resemble Adirondack buildings . The home site also includes a chicken coop , which is considered a contributing building , and the remains of a barn and generator house , both of which are non-contributing . Perley sold the house in 1913 when his company 's headquarters moved to North Carolina ; after passing through two other owners , it became a summer home for the Laurel River Club in 1925 . Due to a 1985 flood , the house is the only surviving building from Perley & Crockett 's operations in Jenningston .

According to the interview , the name was derived from a local football team that was in his home town in Trinidad and Tobago , who called themselves " Oceans 11 " . In 1976 , he recorded his first album , '' Billy Ocean '' , with its first single release , " Love Really Hurts Without You " , charting at No. 2 in the UK Singles Chart and No. 22 in the US '' Billboard '' Hot 100 . He enjoyed club success from the songs " Are You Ready " and " Stay The Night " from the album '' City Limit '' — both of which were later covered by La Toya Jackson . More successes ensued , including " L.O.D. ( Love on Delivery ) " . He also wrote and composed songs for other artists . In 1981 , he scored the US R&B chart with " Nights ( Feel Like Getting Down ) . " Ocean 's period of greatest success began with the releases , during 1984 , of the album '' Suddenly '' and its main single , " Caribbean Queen ( No More Love on the Run ) " . The song 's title and lyrics were changed for different regions , such that the song is also known as " African Queen " or " European Queen " . The song won Ocean the Grammy Award for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance at the 1985 Grammy Awards and was also nominated for Best R&B Song , losing to " I Feel for You " by Prince ( songwriter ) . Ocean was later presented his award by Shalamar group member Jeffrey Daniel on '' 620 Soul Train '' , a UK incarnation of the American music dance show '' Soul Train '' . The album 's title track also became a success , peaking at No. 4 in both the US and the UK and the song " Loverboy " , while also being a No. 2 US success in 1985 was also featured in the first scene of the popular UK BBC One TV series '' Casualty '' , in 1986 .

		CONTEXT=In U.S. law , the bad tendency principle is a test which permits restriction of freedom of speech by government if it is believed that a form of speech has a sole tendency to incite or cause illegal activity . The principle , formulated in Patterson v. Colorado , ( 1907 ) was seemingly overturned with the " clear and present danger " principle used in the landmark case Schenck v. United States ( 1919 ) , as stated by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes , Jr. . Yet eight months later , at the start of the next term in Abrams v. United States ( 1919 ) the Court again used the bad tendency test to uphold the conviction of a Russian immigrant who published and distributed leaflets calling for a general strike and otherwise advocated revolutionary , anarchist , and socialist views . Holmes dissented in Abrams , explaining how the clear and present danger test should be employed to overturn Abrams ' conviction . The re-emergence of the bad tendency test resulted in a string of cases after Abrams employing that test , including Whitney v. California ( 1927 ) , where a woman was convicted simply because of her association with the Communist Party . The court ruled unanimously that although she had not committed any crimes , her relationship with the Communists represented a " bad tendency " and thus was unprotected . The " bad tendency " test was finally overturned in Brandenburg v. Ohio ( 1969 ) and was replaced by the " imminent lawless action " test .

		CONTEXT=Academic bias is the bias or perceived bias of scholars allowing their beliefs to shape their research and the scientific community . It can refer to several types of scholastic prejudice , e.g. , logocentrism , phonocentrism , ethnocentrism or the belief that some sciences and disciplines rank higher than others . In United States of America in particular , claims of bias are often linked to claims by conservatives of pervasive bias against political conservatives and religious Christians . This claim focuses on what conservatives such as David Horowitz say is discrimination against those who hold a conservative ideology and on the argument that research has been corrupted by a desire to promote a progressive agenda . Barry Ames et al. , John Lee and Henry Giroux have argued that these claims are based upon anecdotal evidence that would not reliably indicate systematic bias . Russell Jacoby has argued that claims of academic bias have been used to push measures that infringe on academic freedom .

Since the 2011 Egyptian Revolution , unrest has become more prevalent in the area including the 2012 Egyptian-Israeli border attack in which 16 Egyptian soldiers were killed by militants .

" US President Barack Obama approved the targeted killing of al-Awlaki by April 2010 , making al-Awlaki the first US citizen ever placed on the CIA target list . That required the consent of the US National Security Council , and officials argued that the attack was appropriate because the individual posed an imminent danger to national security . In May 2010 , Faisal Shahzad , who pleaded guilty to the 2010 Times Square car bombing attempt , told interrogators he was " inspired by " al-Awlaki , and sources said Shahzad had made contact with al-Awlaki over the Internet . Representative Jane Harman called him " terrorist number one " , and '' Investor 's Business Daily '' called him " the world 's most dangerous man " . In July 2010 , the US Treasury Department added him to its list of Specially Designated Global Terrorists , and the UN added him to its list of individuals associated with al-Qaeda . In August 2010 , al-Awlaki 's father initiated a lawsuit against the US government with the American Civil Liberties Union , challenging its order to kill al-Awlaki . In October 2010 , US and UK officials linked al-Awlaki to the 2010 cargo plane bomb plot . In September 2011 , al-Awlaki was killed in a targeted killing drone attack in Yemen .

QUERY_CONTEXT=In early August 2012 , Israel 's National Security Council 's counter-terrorism bureau renewed its travel advisory against visiting the Sinai Peninsula , due to information on potential terrorist attacks against tourists , including kidnappings . The warning may have been due to Hamas ' release of Abu Walid al-Maqdisi , a Salafi leader of an al-Qaeda-affiliated terrorist group , responsible for three bombings in Dahab in 2006 , and which is believed to have close ties with terror cells operating in the Sinai Peninsula . The following day , the United States also issued a travel warning to Americans to " take precautions in travel to the Sinai " and warned that " overland travel from Israel to the Sinai in particular is strongly discouraged . " Over the weekend prior to the attack on the border , various intelligence reports reaching the IDF 's Southern Command warned of an impending attack . Specific information regarding the time , target , and location of the attack could not be ascertained . Still , Southern Command Maj.-Gen . Tal Russo prepared his troops in case of an attack . Armored , Engineering , and Infantry soldiers were placed on high alert while the Israeli Air Force was deployed in the area as reinforcement . Russo evacuated troops from the Kerem Shalom border crossing , where the militants would later break through , in anticipation of them coming under attack

QUERY_CONTEXT=In the 1959 review for '' Sight & Sound '' , David Vaughan calls '' Gigi '' " an elegant film " with a " cultivated visual taste which is everywhere apparent " . He summarises that " while '' Gigi '' does not represent a revival of the MGM musical in its heyday , it is a welcome extension of latter-day musical style in its adult subject-matter and its avoidance of spectacle made vulgar by emphasis on size . " He praises Minnelli 's talent for " the delicious amorality of the anecdote , but also the honesty and irony of its telling which have become foreign to the American cinema . " Vaughan points out " Chevalier 's practiced but irresistible charm as one of the film 's greatest assets " as well as " the brilliant high-comedy playing of Isabel Jeans , who as Aunt Alicia consummately portrays the distinction and beauty of a retired aristocrat of the '' demimonde '' . " Bosley Crowther of '' The New York Times '' called it " a musical film that bears such a basic resemblance to '' My Fair Lady '' that the authors may want to sue themselves " . He added , " But do n't think this point of resemblance is made in criticism of the film , for '' Gigi '' is a charming entertainment that can stand on its own two legs . It is not only a charming comprehension of the spicy confection of Colette , but it is also a lovely and lyrical enlargement upon that story 's flavored mood and atmosphere … Vincente Minnelli has marshaled a cast to give a set of performances that , for quality and harmony , are superb . " Abel Green of '' Variety '' called the film " 100 % escapist fare " and predicted it " is destined for a global box-office mop-up " . He added , " Alan Jay Lerner 's libretto is tailor-made for an inspired casting job for all principals , and Fritz Loewe 's tunes ( to Lerner 's lyrics ) already vie with and suggest their memorable '' My Fair Lady '' score … Miss Caron is completely captivating and convincing in the title role … Skillful casting , performance and presentation have endowed realism to the sum total … Director Minnelli 's good taste in keeping it in bounds and the general sound judgment of all concerned … distinguishes this Arthur Freed independent production . The Metrocolor rates recognition for its soft pastels under Joseph Ruttenberg 's lensing ; the Beaton costumes , sets and general production design are vivid physical assets at first sight . The skillful integration of words-and-music with the plot motivation makes this '' Gigi '' a very fair lady indeed as a boxoffice entry . " '' Time Out New York '' said , " The dominating creative contribution comes from Minnelli and Cecil Beaton … The combination of these two visual elitists is really too much — it 's like a meal consisting of cheesecake , and one quickly longs for something solid and vulgar to weigh things down . No doubt inspired by the finicky , claustrophobic sets and bric-à-brac , the cast tries ( with unfortunate success ) to be more French than the French , especially Chevalier . The exception is Gingold , who inhabits , as always , a world of her own . " '' TV Guide '' rated the film 3 ½ out of five stars , calling it " Overbaked but enjoyable , and a banquet for the eyes , thanks to the visual wonder of the Minnelli-Beaton teaming … Caron … leads the cast in a contest to see who can be the most French . The winner is Chevalier , in a performance that makes one feel as if you 're gagging on pastry … Perhaps if the sweetness of '' Gigi '' was contrasted with elements of honest vulgarity , the picture could balance itself out … Ten minutes into the movie , you 've resolved the plot and are left to wallow in lovely frou-frou . The film makes wonderful use of the usual Parisian landmarks , and benefits from extraordinary period costumes and sets . " '' Gigi '' won a record-breaking nine Academy Awards ( at the 1959 Oscars ceremony ) ; however , this record only lasted for one year , as '' Ben-Hur '' broke this record the following year with 11 Oscars . In tribute to '' Gigi '' s domination of the Oscars , the MGM switchboard answered calls the following day with " M-Gigi-M " . '' Gigi '' , eventually along with 1987 's '' The Last Emperor '' , held the record as the film ( s ) with the most Academy Award wins in every category in which it was nominated , until 2003 's '' The Lord of the Rings : The Return of the King '' broke the record at the 2004 Oscars ceremony with 11 Oscar nominations and 11 Oscar wins

		CONTEXT=Critical opinion regarding the film has been overwhelmingly positive . '' The Village Voice '' critic J. Hoberman , who in 1981 included the film in his list of the ten best films commercially released in the United States during that year , more recently wrote that the film is one " of the richest avant-garde features of the 1970s " and praised its " winning combination of sexual frankness and visual wit , " while another critic , Dennis Schwartz , wrote that the " film 's beauty is derived from its sexual frankness and playfully drawn out intimate relationship scenes , witty use of photography , and its originality as it breaks free of conventional unities of body , space and time . Export skillfully edits montage and integrates video , still photography , and performance art with elements from Cubism , Surrealism , Dada and avant-garde cinema . " '' Artforum '' noted in November 1980 that " w atching their scenes together , we realize how seldom , if ever before , the details of sexual intimacy have been shown in film from the point of view from a woman . Export privileges rupture over unity and never settles for one-dimensional solutions " and it was called one " of the most original films in this year 's exposition " and a " tour de force of cinematic invention " grounded in the director 's " fresh and intelligent sensibility , characteristically self-referential . Her visual resources include mirrors , still photography , video , dance , and films within the film , all employed with a bold and surprising inventiveness " by the catalogue notes of the 1978 Los Angeles International Film Exposition . Similarly , critic Alison Butler wrote that the " film is a witty and visually brilliant essay on gender and experience , culture and environment " and program notes used by the San Francisco Cinematheque during a screening quote critic Amy Taubin as opining that the film " makes you reconsider what you and everyone else is doing — in life and in art " and critic Steve Anker underscoring that it is an important " crossover film " combining " avant-garde and theatrical sensibilities , made during the mid-1970s . It chronicles the nightmarish breakdown of a fashion photographer as she confronts her waning identity and security as a career woman ; blending narrative experimentation , fantasy , fact and theoretical critique , it has enormous impact on independent features which followed it . " PopMatters noted that the film has " enough originality to nag at patient viewers and get at least partially under our skin " and critic Michael Atkinson wrote that it is a " weird , restless , beguilingly offbeat bit of dreamwork . " The film was presented for the first time at the Berlin International Film Festival in 1977 , it has won a Special Jury Prize at the Venice Film Festival and was recently called " seminal " during a screening at a repertory cinema , " a strong and humoristic showdown " at another and " a sonically-complex , montage-rich , darkly funny and uriniferous cornerstone of avant-garde cinema " during a screening at a New York University class . Critic Peter Hajek wrote in the Austrian newspaper '' Kurier '' that " Valie Export presents this psychopanoptic view of the present in solid , striking images and often in unexpected humorous passages . " Critic Chris Holmlund , author of the scholarly article " Feminist Makeovers : The Celluloid Surgery of Valie Export and Su Friedrich , " referred to '' Invisible Adversaries '' as a feminist version of '' Invasion of the Body Snatchers '' , noted that the film includes references to famous paintings and to '' Un Chien Andalou '' , and wrote that therefore it " is visually rick , entertaining , striking , but also demanding . " A few reviews , however , were negative . For example , London 's '' Time Out '' wrote about the film that it is " n ot unlike '' W.R. : Mysteries of the Organism '' " and that it will " probably age as badly " and a reviewer for '' The Heights '' wrote that " I was expecting a great feminist work here , but got mediocrity . I can not recommend that you see this film , " though he nevertheless praised the film as a " cornucopia of video spectacle in which Export delights , confounds and amuses the audience with her antics .

		CONTEXT=, the film holds a rating of 75 % on Rotten Tomatoes based on 28 reviews , with an average rating of 6.47 / 10 . The website 's critical consensus reads : " Abel Ferrara 's 1995 horror/suspense experiment blends urban vampire adventure with philosophical analysis to create a smart , idiosyncratic and undeniably odd take on the genre . " Kevin Thomas of the '' Los Angeles Times '' praised Taylor 's performance , and added : " Although Ferrara dares to be intellectual in a manner virtually unique in commercial American cinema , he nevertheless does n't forget how to entertain in the gory , bravura manner associated with him . Although it undeniably helps , you do n't have to know your Heidegger from Hamburger Helper to enjoy '' The Addiction '' as a grisly yet unusual thriller of the supernatural . " '' The Washington Post '' s Hal Hinson was less laudatory of Taylor 's performance , writing that she " seems less distinctive here than she has been in past roles . " However , he praised Walken 's performance , though summarized the film as " serious and passionate ; Ferrara 's conviction , too , is unquestionable . However , when he flashes images of historic atrocities of both the distant and recent past — Nazi death camps , the war dead in Bosnia — his ideas come across as shallow and banal . Also , inserting scenes of real-life horror into what is essentially a glorified genre exercise may strike some as the essence of bad taste . " Caryn James of '' The New York Times '' expressed a similar sentiment , noting " When the film connects Kathleen 's struggle to resist evil to My Lai and the Holocaust , those comparisons are exploitative in a way that even a genre-bending film ca n't get away with . " Stephen Hunter of '' The Baltimore Sun '' praised Taylor for portraying Kathleen " with dour , sexless intensity , " and deemed the film " far sexier than '' Interview with the Vampire '' and far deadlier than the campy '' Nadja '' ... It 's extremely disturbing , a graduate - level movie for advanced students in either of three subjects : cinema , philosophy and debauchery . " The film was nominated for the Golden Bear award at the 45th Berlin International Film Festival where it won the Blue Angel Award . Lili Taylor won the Sant Jordi Award for Best Foreign Actress . The film received Best Actress ( Taylor ) , Best Film ( Abel Ferrara ) and Special Mention Award ( Walken ) at the Málaga International Week of Fantastic Cinema .

In 2001 the calendar year result was a 140 per cent combined ratio , driven largely by claims arising out of the World Trade Center attack , reserve increases for prior-year liabilities and deteriorating pricing levels . However , since then , the market has generally enjoyed profitability in every year except those marked by large natural catastrophes .

		CONTEXT=Although Greece had been granted a spot in the 2008 final because of its seventh-place finish at the Eurovision Song Contest 2007 , it had to compete in a semi-final for the first time since 2004 because of new rules put into effect by the European Broadcasting Union ( EBU ) . In previous years , countries that received a top 10 placing were automatically granted a spot in the next year 's final without having to compete in a semi-final , but for 2008 , the EBU changed the automatic qualification regulations so that all countries except the " Big 4 " ( France , Germany , Spain , and the United Kingdom ) and host country , would have to pass through one of two semi-finals . The EBU split up countries with a friendly voting history into separate semi-finals , to give a better chance for other countries to win . Greece and Cyprus had often been accused of favoring each other , with each awarding the other the maximum number of points ( twelve ) at the previous contest . On January 28 , 2008 , the EBU held a special draw which determined that Greece would be in '' Semi-final 1 '' held on May 20 , 2008 in Belgrade , Serbia ; Cyprus was subsequently placed in the second semi-final

QUERY_CONTEXT=Although Greece had been granted a spot in the 2008 final because of its seventh-place finish at the Eurovision Song Contest 2007 , it had to compete in a semi-final for the first time since 2004 because of new rules put into effect by the European Broadcasting Union ( EBU ) . In previous years , countries that received a top 10 placing were automatically granted a spot in the next year 's final without having to compete in a semi-final , but for 2008 , the EBU changed the automatic qualification regulations so that all countries except the " Big 4 " ( France , Germany , Spain , and the United Kingdom ) and host country , would have to pass through one of two semi-finals . The EBU split up countries with a friendly voting history into separate semi-finals , to give a better chance for other countries to win . Greece and Cyprus had often been accused of favoring each other , with each awarding the other the maximum number of points ( twelve ) at the previous contest . On January 28 , 2008 , the EBU held a special draw which determined that Greece would be in '' Semi-final 1 '' held on May 20 , 2008 in Belgrade , Serbia ; Cyprus was subsequently placed in the second semi-final

		CONTEXT=Although Greece had been granted a spot in the 2008 final because of its seventh-place finish at the Eurovision Song Contest 2007 , it had to compete in a semi-final for the first time since 2004 because of new rules put into effect by the European Broadcasting Union ( EBU ) . In previous years , countries that received a top 10 placing were automatically granted a spot in the next year 's final without having to compete in a semi-final , but for 2008 , the EBU changed the automatic qualification regulations so that all countries except the " Big 4 " ( France , Germany , Spain , and the United Kingdom ) and host country , would have to pass through one of two semi-finals . The EBU split up countries with a friendly voting history into separate semi-finals , to give a better chance for other countries to win . Greece and Cyprus had often been accused of favoring each other , with each awarding the other the maximum number of points ( twelve ) at the previous contest . On January 28 , 2008 , the EBU held a special draw which determined that Greece would be in '' Semi-final 1 '' held on May 20 , 2008 in Belgrade , Serbia ; Cyprus was subsequently placed in the second semi-final

		CONTEXT=Although Greece had been granted a spot in the 2008 final because of its seventh-place finish at the Eurovision Song Contest 2007 , it had to compete in a semi-final for the first time since 2004 because of new rules put into effect by the European Broadcasting Union ( EBU ) . In previous years , countries that received a top 10 placing were automatically granted a spot in the next year 's final without having to compete in a semi-final , but for 2008 , the EBU changed the automatic qualification regulations so that all countries except the " Big 4 " ( France , Germany , Spain , and the United Kingdom ) and host country , would have to pass through one of two semi-finals . The EBU split up countries with a friendly voting history into separate semi-finals , to give a better chance for other countries to win . Greece and Cyprus had often been accused of favoring each other , with each awarding the other the maximum number of points ( twelve ) at the previous contest . On January 28 , 2008 , the EBU held a special draw which determined that Greece would be in '' Semi-final 1 '' held on May 20 , 2008 in Belgrade , Serbia ; Cyprus was subsequently placed in the second semi-final

		CONTEXT=Although Greece had been granted a spot in the 2008 final because of its seventh-place finish at the Eurovision Song Contest 2007 , it had to compete in a semi-final for the first time since 2004 because of new rules put into effect by the European Broadcasting Union ( EBU ) . In previous years , countries that received a top 10 placing were automatically granted a spot in the next year 's final without having to compete in a semi-final , but for 2008 , the EBU changed the automatic qualification regulations so that all countries except the " Big 4 " ( France , Germany , Spain , and the United Kingdom ) and host country , would have to pass through one of two semi-finals . The EBU split up countries with a friendly voting history into separate semi-finals , to give a better chance for other countries to win . Greece and Cyprus had often been accused of favoring each other , with each awarding the other the maximum number of points ( twelve ) at the previous contest . On January 28 , 2008 , the EBU held a special draw which determined that Greece would be in '' Semi-final 1 '' held on May 20 , 2008 in Belgrade , Serbia ; Cyprus was subsequently placed in the second semi-final

QUERY_CONTEXT=Duane Allman created the idea of having two lead guitarists , which was inspired by Curtis Mayfield ; " he wanted the bass , keyboards , and second guitar to form patterns behind the solo rather than just comping , " said Allman . Their style and incorporation of guitar harmonies was very influential on later musicians . " The pair also had a wide range of complementary techniques , often forming intricate , interlocking patterns with each other and with the bassist , Berry Oakley , setting the stage for dramatic flights of improvised melodies . " Dickey Betts ' playing was very melody-based ; " My style is just a little too smooth and round to play the blues stuff straight , because I 'm such a melody guy that even when I 'm playing the blues , I go for melody first , " he said . His listening of country and string bluegrass growing up influenced this considerably : " I played mandolin , ukulele , and fiddle before I ever touched a guitar , which may be where a lot of the major keys I play come from . " He later characterized their style as " question and answer , anticipation and conclusion , " which involved allowing each musician 's downbeat to arrive in a different spot , while also keeping consideration of the bass guitar lines . The group also held an improvisational approach to live performances , which connected the band with jam band culture . " Jazz and blues musicians have been doing this for decades , but I think they really brought that sense that anyone onstage can inspire anyone else at any given time to rock music , " said Haynes . " We sure did n't set out to be a " jam band " but those long jams just emanated from within the band , because we did n't want to just play three minutes and be over , " said Allman . '' Rolling Stone '' referred to the group as " without question the first great jam band , and they took the jam to heights that it had not previously reached . " The Allman Brothers Band were considerably influential within the Southern United States . Their arrival on the musical scene paved the way for several other notable Southern rock bands — among those Lynyrd Skynyrd , the Marshall Tucker Band and Wet Willie — to achieve commercial success , and also " almost single-handedly " made Capricorn Records into " a major independent label . " Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top , writing for '' Rolling Stone '' , wrote that the group " defined the best of every music from the American South in that time . They were the best of all of us . " He went on to call the band " a true brotherhood of players — one that went beyond race and ego . It was a thing of beauty . " The band 's extended popularity through heavy touring in the early 1990s created a new generation of fans , one that viewed the Allmans as pioneers of " latter-day collegiate jam rock . " AllMusic praised the band 's history : " they went from being America 's single most influential band to a shell of their former self trading on past glories , to reach the 21st century resurrected as one of the most respected rock acts of their era . " In 2012 , an official historic marker was erected on the site of the July 1970 Second Atlanta International Pop Festival near Byron , Georgia . The Allman Brothers Band had played two sets at the festival , which was a significant event in their career . The marker text reads , in part : " Over thirty musical acts performed , including ... Macon 's Allman Brothers Band on their launching pad to national fame . " Official sponsors of the marker included the Georgia Allman Brothers Band Association , The Allman Brothers Band Museum at the Big House , and '' Hittin ' the Note '' . In 2003 , the band released a recording of their festival opening and closing performances , '' Live at the Atlanta International Pop Festival : July 3 & 5 , 1970 ''

He deemed ' ' The New Classic '' " plenty authentic -- and damn good to boot " while dismissing Azalea 's media naysayers : " predictably , the songs where she expresses wonderment that ' Impossible Is Nothing ' are more relatable than the ones where she flaunts her liquid assets . But the ones where she pledges to keep on striving are more relatable than that , because striving is built into her flow itself . That 's what her complexity is about . " Phil Johnson from '' The Independent '' called it " an instantly engaging showcase of the 23-year-old Aussie 's talents – poppy without diluting her fierce-flowing charisma . " Kellan Miller of '' XXL '' said despite some poor songs near the end of the record , it is " a persuasive indicator that Iggy Azalea will be around for the long haul . " '' The New Classic '' was named one of the best hip-hop albums of the year by '' XXL '' on a list published on 30 June 2014 , adding that " the album proved to a gang of skepts who doubted Iggy 's controversial style from the start that she was more than capable of making hip-hop tracks with a pop appeal . " It was placed at number twenty-five on Digital Spy 's top albums of 2014 and listed among Fuse 's 40 best albums of 2014 . The album won the Breakthrough Artist Release award at the 2014 ARIA Music Awards and Favorite Rap/Hip-Hop Album at the 2014 American Music Awards , beating out Drake 's '' Nothing Was the Same '' and Eminem 's '' The Marshall Mathers LP 2 '' .

QUERY_ANSWERS={'Caltavuturo massacre'}
QUERY_CONTEXT=According to many scholars , the name and origin of the town are traced back to the period of Arab rule . According to Ibn al-Athir ( '' The Complete History '' , VII .370.5 – 7 ) , in AH 268 ( 881/82 CE ) , the Aghlabid commander Abū Ṯawr was defeated by the Byzantines ( probably commanded by the '' strategos '' Mosilikes ) and his was army annihilated , with only seven men surviving . The locality was later named in Arabic '' Qalʿat Abī Ṯawr '' ( " Castle of Abū Ṯawr " ) , which is the origin of the modern name . Others instead maintain that the name derives from the Arabic word " qal ' at " ( fortress ) and the Sicilian " vuturu " ( vulture ) meaning of " fortress of vultures . " The town existed under Byzantine rule pre Arab conquest as Aziz Ahmad in “ A Islamic History of Sicily ” ( edinburgh university press 1975 ) states that in 852 Abbas raided Caltavuturo in the northern part of the Island and took many prisoners who were sold as slaves , The town was the site of the so-called Caltavuturo massacre on 20 January 1893 , when local authorities killed 13 and wounded 21 peasants that had occupied communal land that they claimed was theirs

The troops voted overwhelmingly to fight their former allies the Germans , thus the '' Acqui '' became one of the very few Italian units to actively resist the Germans . The Germans therefore summarily executed over half of the divisions soldiers and all of its officers in revenge during the Massacre of the Acqui Division

		CONTEXT=Kleisoura ( , also Βλαχοκλεισούρα , '' Vlachokleisoúra '' ; ) is a traditionally Aromanian ( Vlach ) settlement and a former municipality in Kastoria regional unit , West Macedonia , Greece . Since the 2011 local government reform , it is part of the municipality of Kastoria , of which it is a municipal unit . The municipal unit has an area of 37.069 km2 . Population 259 ( 2011 ) . On 5 April 1944 , the German occupation forces under the command of Karl Schümers , commander of the 7th regiment of the 4th Armored Division of the SS , the same unit to later that year commit the massacre in Distomo , slaughtered the women and children of Kleisoura in retaliation for the execution of three German soldiers by ELAS close to the village . The ELAS guerrillas , led by Alexis Rosios from Siatisti ( " Captain Ypsilantis " ) , who were active in the region , had attacked a German military phalanx at Daouli , close to Kleisoura , and had killed a vanguard of three motorcyclists . According to testimonies , the male residents , fearing retaliation , fled to the mountains surrounding the village . After finding the mutilated bodies of the Wehrmacht soldiers close to the local church , the German SS unit went to the homes , broke the doors of the majority of the houses , shot the people within , set fire to the buildings and also killed whom they found in the streets . Altogether 270 residents were killed , the overwhelming majority of them being women , children and elderly people . Involved in the atrocities was also a Bulgarian militia under German command , led by Andon Kalchev . Colonel Karl Schümers was summoned by the German administration for having ordered the slaughter of women and children . He testified that his soldiers were forced to kill the civilians because rebel forces were hiding and firing through the village , whereupon he was acquitted , despite the contradictory statements of his subordinates . After the war it was proved that his testimony was false

QUERY_CONTEXT='' The Amazing Race '' won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Reality-Competition Program for the first seven years after the creation of the award in 2003 , and ten of the twelve years since its creation , against other , more popular reality TV shows such as '' Survivor '' , '' Dancing with the Stars '' , and '' American Idol '' . Its streak was ended in 2010 when '' Top Chef '' won the Emmy for this category . Host Phil Keoghan revealed in an interview that the show 's loss that year made him and the producers realize that they will have to try harder to win the Emmy again . In 2011 , the show won in the category again for the eighth time . After its seventh consecutive win , some in the media , including '' Survivor '' host Jeff Probst suggested that '' The Amazing Race '' willingly drop out from the competition in future years , similar to Candice Bergen declining any further nominations after her fifth Emmy win for her role in '' Murphy Brown '' . Van Munster has stated that it is " not likely " he will pull the show from future Emmy awards , considering that it reflects on his and his crew 's hard work and high standards . The show has also been nominated and won several times for technical production ( Creative Arts ) Emmy awards , for Cinematography and Picture Editing for Non-Fiction programs , whereas it has only been nominated for Sound Mixing and Sound Editing for Non-Fiction programs . The show has been nominated in the same five categories for three years consecutively , a trend which continued with the 2007 Primetime Emmy Awards

QUERY_CONTEXT=Prior to and during the Civil War , Pennsylvania was a divided state . Although Pennsylvania had outlawed slavery , many conservative Pennsylvanians believed that the federal government should not interfere with the institution of slavery . One such individual was Democrat James Buchanan , the last pre-Civil War president . Buchanan 's party had generally won presidential and gubernatorial elections in Pennsylvania . However , the nascent Republican Party 's first convention took place in Philadelphia , and the 1860 elections saw the Republican Party win the state 's presidential vote and the governor 's office . After the failure of the Crittenden Compromise , the secession of the South , and the Battle of Fort Sumter , the Civil War began with Pennsylvania as a key member of the Union . Despite the Republican victory the 1860 election , Democrats remained powerful in the state , and several " copperheads " called for peace during the war . The Democrats re-took control of the state legislature in the 1862 election , but incumbent Republican Governor Andrew Curtin retained control of the governorship in 1863 . In the 1864 election , President Lincoln narrowly defeated Pennsylvania native George B. McClellan for the state 's electoral votes

		CONTEXT=Blaine 's career as a Republican newspaperman led naturally to involvement in Republican party politics . In 1856 , he was selected as a delegate to the first Republican National Convention . From the party 's early days , Blaine identified with the conservative wing , supporting Supreme Court Justice John McLean for the presidential nomination over the more radical John C. Frémont , the eventual nominee . The following year , Blaine was offered the editorship of the '' Portland Daily Advertiser '' , which he accepted , selling his interest in the '' Journal '' soon thereafter . He still maintained his home in Augusta , however , with his growing family . Although Blaine 's first son , Stanwood , died in infancy , he and Harriet had two more sons soon afterward : Walker , in 1855 , and Emmons , in 1857 . They would have four more children in years to come : Alice , James , Margaret , and Harriet . It was around this time that Blaine left the Presbyterian church of his childhood and joined his wife 's new denomination , becoming a member of the South Parish Congregational Church in Augusta

QUERY_CONTEXT=The first official Republican convention in Illinois was held on May 29 , 1856 , in Bloomington . Chairman John M. Palmer was elected convention president after his opening address . Nine vice presidents and five secretaries were then elected . The convention nominated Bissell for governor with Francis Hoffmann as lieutenant governor , Ozias M. Hatch for secretary of state , Jesse K. Dubois as auditor , and James Miller as treasurer . Hoffmann was found to be ineligible for his position due to a residency requirement , and John Wood was nominated in his place . The following resolutions defining the party platform were approved : Resolved , That foregoing all former differences of opinions upon other questions , we pledge ourselves to unite in opposition to the present administration and to the party which upholds and supports it and to use all honorable and constitutional means to wrest the Government from the unworthy hands which now control it and to bring it back in its administration to the principles and practices of Washington , Jefferson and their great and good compatriots of the Revolution . Resolved , That foregoing all former differences of opinions upon other questions , we pledge ourselves to unite in opposition to the present administration of the Government ; that under the Constitution Congress possesses the power to prohibit slavery in the Territories ; and that , whilst we will maintain all constitutional rights of the South , we also hold that justice , humanity , the principles of freedom as expressed in our Declaration of Independence and our national constitution , and the purity and perpetuity of our Government require that that power shall be exerted to prevent the extension of slavery into territory heretofore free . Resolved , That the repeal of the Missouri Compromise was unwise and injurious ; an open and aggravated violation of the plighted faith of the States , and that the attempt of the present administration to force slavery into Kansas against the known wishes of the legal voters of that Territory is an arbitrary and tyrannous violation of the rights of the people to govern themselves , and that we will strive by all constitutional means to secure to Kansas and Nebraska the legal guaranty against slavery of which they were deprived at the cost of the violation of the plighted faith of the nation . Resolved , That we are devoted to the Union and will , to the last extremity , defend it against the efforts now being made by the dis-unionists of this administration to compass its dissolution , and that we will support the Constitution of the United States , in all its provisions regarding it , as the sacred bond of our Union and the only safeguard for the preservation of the rights of ourselves and our posterity . Resolved , That we are in favor of the immediate admission of Kansas as a member of this Confederacy under the constitution adopted by the people of said Territory . Resolved , That the spirit of our institutions as well as the Constitution of our country , guarantees the liberty of conscience as well as political freedom , and that we will proscribe no one by legislation or otherwise on account of religious opinions , or in consequence of place of birth . Lincoln delivered the closing address . The speech was purportedly so captivating that no reporter made a record of it . The address has become known as Lincoln 's Lost Speech . The delegates to the convention were : The Democrats had nominated Richardson for governor at their convention earlier that month . The remnants of the Whig party declined to run a candidate . The first Republican National Convention met that June , nominating John C. Fremont for president . Fremont was defeated handily in his bid for president , including in Illinois , but the Republican state ticket in Illinois was successful . Bissell became the first Governor from a party other than the Democrats since 1838 . Republicans would win every subsequent gubernatorial election through 1893

Resolved , That foregoing all former differences of opinions upon other questions , we pledge ourselves to unite in opposition to the present administration of the Government ; that under the Constitution Congress possesses the power to prohibit slavery in the Territories ; and that , whilst we will maintain all constitutional rights of the South , we also hold that justice , humanity , the principles of freedom as expressed in our Declaration of Independence and our national constitution , and the purity and perpetuity of our Government require that that power shall be exerted to prevent the extension of slavery into territory heretofore free . Resolved , That the repeal of the Missouri Compromise was unwise and injurious ; an open and aggravated violation of the plighted faith of the States , and that the attempt of the present administration to force slavery into Kansas against the known wishes of the legal voters of that Territory is an arbitrary and tyrannous violation of the rights of the people to govern themselves , and that we will strive by all constitutional means to secure to Kansas and Nebraska the legal guaranty against slavery of which they were deprived at the cost of the violation of the plighted faith of the nation . Resolved , That we are devoted to the Union and will , to the last extremity , defend it against the efforts now being made by the dis-unionists of this administration to compass its dissolution , and that we will support the Constitution of the United States , in all its provisions regarding it , as the sacred bond of our Union and the only safeguard for the preservation of the rights of ourselves and our posterity . Resolved , That we are in favor of the immediate admission of Kansas as a member of this Confederacy under the constitution adopted by the people of said Territory . Resolved , That the spirit of our institutions as well as the Constitution of our country , guarantees the liberty of conscience as well as political freedom , and that we will proscribe no one by legislation or otherwise on account of religious opinions , or in consequence of place of birth .

Doing so would reveal the lyrics and an MP3 download of the song . The song was one of the first the band performed from '' Neighborhoods '' , alongside " After Midnight " , " Ghost on the Dance Floor " and " Up All Night " , and was debuted on the first night of the band 's 10th Annual Honda Civic Tour , at the PNC Bank Arts Center in Holmdel , New Jersey . James Montgomery of MTV News commended the song 's " breakneck guitars , yelped vocals and cascading drums , " making reference to his own personal anticipation for '' Neighborhoods '' : " From the sound of things , the new Blink-182 may very well be adept at everything ... Sort of only makes the anticipation that much greater . " Jon Dolan of '' Rolling Stone '' gave the song three stars out of five , writing , " The second taste of Blink 's comeback LP reboots their bubblegum punk , setting a post-breakup bitchfest to shrink-wrapped hardcore that 's pitched perfectly between the mosh pit and the food court . " BBC Music described the song as " blisteringly fast , " commending Barker 's drum work on the song . Thomas Nassiff of AbsolutePunk called the song " instantly accessible , " noting that , for fans , " the song the high-energy pop-punk track we all wanted . " Kyle Ryan of '' The A.V. Club '' referenced it as " a stripped-down punk song that sounds like late - '90s Blink in the best way . It ’s also one of the few songs where Mark Hoppus sings lead . "

		CONTEXT=" Motivation " is a R&B slow jam song written by Richard Butler ( Rico Love ) , Jim Jonsin , Dwayne Carter and Danny Morris . The racy lyrics center around Rowland asking her man to use his hands all over her body , and are accompanied by a " synth-saturated beat " produced by Jonsin . In terms of instruments , " Motivation " uses sparse keyboard notes , programmed beats and pulsing synths in the chorus . Wayne adds a rap verse complementing Rowland 's seductive suggestions , using the kitchen and a car as metaphors for sex . According to Scott Shetler from AOL Music , Rowland uses the lyrics to promise " to be her lover 's motivation . " Rowland called the record a mixture between dance and mash-up . When asked by MTV what Rowland thought of the song , she said , " It has that personality and characteristic to it that I do n't think anybody can deny . That 's why when Wayne dropped that insane verse on there ... I was like , ' You really brought that up even more . ' He went into the studio and just did it . I do n't think it takes much for Wayne to think . He just does it . He 's so admirable . " Ryan Brockington , from the '' New York Post , '' was amongst the first to review " Motivation . " In his review , he said " The single is a big leap from the dance club synth pop that Kelly has been releasing the past year and it seems like she might be trying to shimmy her way back into the hip-hop world by teaming up with the Midas touch vocals of Lil Wayne . " Both '' Rap-Up '' and AOL Music 's Scott Shetler called the song " sexy . " Becky Bain from Idolator disliked the song for not being memorable . The short review was summed up with the closing phrase , " she ’s going to need another hit to help promote her album when it finally is ready to drop . " Wesley Case from '' The Baltimore Sun '' complemented the song 's sexy quality . " If this is n't the year 's hands-down sexiest song thus far , it has to be in the discussion . Rowland , whose sultry voice could get a priest hot , weaving in and out of the minimal beat , and setting the table for Lil Wayne 's stuttering , after-hours guest-verse . Stack the pieces together and it 's an understated knockout that gets sexier with each spin . " Billboard ranked it number five on their " Critics ' Picks : 20 Best Songs of 2011 " " Motivation " was nominated for two awards at the 2011 Soul Train Music Awards including Best Dance Performance and Song of the Year.It won the award for Song of the Year and was also nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration at the 54th Grammy Awards , which was held on February 12 , 2012

The stone railway station in the film was built in 1904 for the Northwestern Pacific Railroad and is one of the few commercial buildings in central Santa Rosa to survive the earthquake of April 18 , 1906 . The station is currently a visitor center . The library was a Carnegie Library which was demolished in 1964 due to seismic concerns . Some of the buildings in the center of Santa Rosa that are seen in the film were damaged or destroyed by earthquakes in 1969 ; much of the area was cleared of debris and largely rebuilt . The film was scored by Dimitri Tiomkin , his first collaboration with Hitchcock ( the others being '' Strangers on a Train '' , '' I Confess '' and '' Dial M for Murder '' ) . In his score , Tiomkin quotes the '' Merry Widow Waltz '' of Franz Lehár , often in somewhat distorted forms , as a leitmotif for Uncle Charlie and his serial murders . During the opening credits , the waltz theme is heard along with a prolonged shot of couples dancing

At that time the Ryukyu Islands were claimed by both Qing China and Japan , and the Japanese interpreted the incident as an attack on their citizens . They took steps to bring the islands in their jurisdiction : in 1872 the Japanese Ryukyu Domain was declared , and in 1874 a retaliatory incursion to Taiwan was sent , which was a success .

		CONTEXT=Crank is a condition in which a ship heels abnormally , and recovers slowly under the action of the wind . If a ship makes long , slow rolls and takes time resuming a vertical position , it is referred to as crank , cranky , crank - sided , tender , or tender - sided . If the ship snaps back to its vertical position when heeled , it is called ʻstiff.ʼ Stiffness refers to a ship 's power to stand up to her canvas , and will offer great resistance to inclination from the upright , when under sail . Although stiff is considered good in the case of many ships , there are extreme cases in which the vessel will be too stiff and resist the tendency to heel under wind pressure , which may cause damage to masts , rigging , and structure . According to Arthur Nelson , “ most new Tudor ships were affected slightly on completion , one way or the other . "

" While Davies ' predecessor , William Christian Bullitt , Jr. had been an admirer of the Soviet Union who gradually came to loathe Stalin 's brutality and repression , Davies remained unaffected by reports of the disappearance of thousands of Russians and foreigners in the Soviet Union throughout his stay as U.S. Ambassador . His reports from the Soviet Union were pragmatic , optimistic , and usually devoid of criticism of Stalin and his policies . While he briefly noted the USSR 's ' authoritarian ' form of government , Davies praised the nation 's boundless natural resources and the contentment of Soviet workers while ' building socialism ' . He went on numerous tours of the country , carefully prearranged by Soviet officials . In one of his final memos from Moscow to Washington D.C. , Davies assessed : Communism holds no serious threat to the United States . Friendly relations in the future may be of great general value . Davies attended the Trial of the Twenty One , one of the Stalinist purge trials of the late 1930s . He was convinced of the guilt of the accused . According to Davies , " the Kremlin 's fears regarding treason in the Army and Party were well justified " . His opinions were at odds with much of the Western press of the day , as well as those of his own staff , many of whom had been in the country far longer than Davies . The career diplomat Charles Bohlen , who served under Davies in Moscow , later wrote : Davies even claimed that communism was " protecting the Christian world of free men " , and he urged all Christians " by the faith you have found at your mother 's knee , in the name of the faith you have found in temples of worship " to embrace the Soviet Union

		CONTEXT=The ACCAR alternative to the hemispherical cruising altitude rules , if adopted in 1997 , could have eliminated the navigation paradox at all altitudes , and could have saved 342 lives in over 30 midair collisions ( up to November 2006 ) since Patlovany 's risk analysis proves that the current regulations increase the risk of a midair collision in direct proportion to pilot compliance . The Namibian collision in 1997 , the Japanese near-miss in 2001 , the Überlingen collision in Germany in 2002 , and the Amazon collision in 2006 , are all examples where human or hardware errors doomed altitude-accurate pilots killed by the navigation paradox designed into the current cruising altitude rules . The current system as described by Paielli noted as examples of other safety critical systems , nuclear power plants and elevators are designed to be passively safe and fault tolerant . The navigation paradox describes a midair collision safety system that by design can not tolerate a single failure in human performance or electronic hardware

QUERY_CONTEXT=Writing for '' The New York Times '' , John J. O'Connor described the production as " a richly textured tapestry crammed with the social details that were the speciality of Mr. Delderfield " , with " a steady flow of insightful and touching moments " . He praised the performances of the cast and that of Duttine in particular . '' People '' magazine called the series a " colorful chronicle of post-World War I England that never crosses over to the gooey side of sentiment . " In a review for the DVD release in 2011 , '' PopMatters '' was less enthusiastic , calling Delderfield 's material " inconsequential " and writing : " The action veers sluggishly from the mildly diverting to the excruciatingly dull . " The review summarised the series as " basically a dated , dull , tiresome , tedious old drama by an author whose reputation is far from robust . " The adaptation was nominated in the Best Drama Series category at the 1981 British Academy Television Awards and in the Outstanding Limited Series category at the 1983 Primetime Emmy Awards

		CONTEXT=Hale 's Island is a island located on the Merrimack River in Haverhill / Bradford , Massachusetts . The property is part of Silsby 's farm . Although there is not much there now , the island has reportedly been home to a golf course , a hotel , and even a small airport . The golf course was destroyed in 1936 when the island flooded . There is still the remnants of a foundation on the island . This was the foundation of the golf course club house . There are also four artesian wells on the island . Other than that , the island is mostly inhabited by snakes , bugs , and some birds . It is becoming increasingly overgrown these days . There is a stone bridge that connects it to land on the Bradford side . This can barely be seen when the water is low , and impossible when the water is high . The bridge was mostly destroyed in the 1936 flood that destroyed the golf course . The bridge was built to allow cows to move back and forth to the island for grazing . The island is not listed as an airport on any aeronautical charts . More than likely , that reference is to the area of the River on the north side of the island which was listed for landing seaplanes , and connected to an airfield which was previously located on Coffin Rd where there is now a marina .

		CONTEXT=Baffin Bay was the epicenter of a 7.3 magnitude earthquake in 1933 . This is the largest known earthquake north of the Arctic Circle . It caused no damage because of its offshore location and the small number of the nearby onshore communities . The northwestern part of the bay remains one of the most seismically active regions in eastern Canada . Five earthquakes of magnitude 6 have occurred here since 1933 . The latest strong earthquake occurred on 15 April 2010 and had the magnitude of 5.1

		CONTEXT=On 4 October 2009 , Fred Halliday , Emeritus Professor of International Relations at the LSE and the School 's leading expert on the Middle East , wrote a memorandum to the LSE Council regarding the proposed cooperation with the Gaddafi Foundation . " I have repeatedly expressed reservations about formal educational and funding links with that country . " While those in favour of accepting the donation argued that " Libya is changing internally , " most informed observers agree that while some of the worst excesses for the moment have ceased , the rights of its people are badly protected . Libya " remains a country run by a secretive , erratic and corrupt elite . " Since 9/11 the Libyan government has reached compromises with the West on a number of issues , notably the Lockerbie bombing and nuclear weapons . Yet tactical changes in foreign policy are not sufficient for the purposes of evaluating political and academic links . There are also ways in which Libyan foreign policy has '' not '' changed : the country continues to call for the destruction of Israel ; Muammar Gaddafi recently called for the abolition of Switzerland , and he receives the leader of the Somali pirates operating off the Horn of Africa as honoured guests of state . Moreover , Libya 's handling of the Lockerbie bombing " has not been characterised by either consistency or clarity , " I have in the past , Halliday noted , defended accepting grants from authoritarian regimes such as the Gulf states , " but there should be clear limits on this , depending on the degree of political and human rights abuses perpetrated with them and on their ongoing foreign policy conduct . " Whitehall and the City are now happy to do business with Libya , but it does not follow that the LSE should do the same . Responsible leaders throughout the Middle East continue to express reservations regarding Libya , including " its more prominent ' liberal ' representatives . " We must remember , Halliday concluded , that the " liberal " wing within a regime such as Libya does not have the function of producing change but its role is instead " to reach compromises with internal hard-liners that serve to lessen external pressure . " A good case in point are the proposals LSE now is considering . It is , as LSE alumni in positions of responsibility in the region caution , " far too early for the School to take this step . " In 2009 , Human Rights Watch was allowed entry to Libya , via Saif al-Islam Gaddafi 's non-profit organization in order to gather facts about the human rights situation there . While HRW reported that there were concerns about the " repressive atmosphere , " they felt there were signs of " improvement " and Sarah Leah Whitson , director of HRW 's Middle East division said that one should not " underestimate the importance of the efforts made so far " by Gaddafi in the realm of human rights in Libya . She also wrote of her official visit that " the real impetus for the transformation rests squarely with a quasi-governmental organization , the Qaddafi Foundation for International Charities and Development " chaired by Gaddafi . She praised Gaddafi for establishing the country 's two semi-private newspapers , and said " it is impossible to underestimate the importance of the efforts made so far . Let 's hope this spring will last . " In January 2011 , HRW criticised other organisations as well as governments that had previously dealt with Gaddafi . HRW Business and Human Rights Director Arvind Ganesan condemned the London School of Economics ( LSE ) for allowing " abusive and corrupt officials or their families to launder their images in exchange for money " . This was later followed by Ganesen saying that " the London School of Economics did not act until Saif al-Islam 's father literally began to kill his own people " . According to NGO Monitor , this was despite the fact that David Held , Co-Director of LSE Global Governance , was partially influenced by Whitson 's remarks regarding her Libyan visit , referring to Saif al-Islam Gaddafi as a reformer

		SCORE=0.1876823678612709
		CONTEXT=Jasser has said that he and his family have helped build a number of small mosques in different cities using locally raised funds , and at times encountering , but always overcoming local opposition . In 2010 Jasser strongly opposed the building of the Park51 project , a 13-story Islamic community center and mosque two blocks from the World Trade Center site , which is also known as Ground Zero . He said he was concerned that the funding of the $ 100 million project might be coming from foreign Islamist sources , and also said : " Ground Zero is purely about being American . It can never be about being Muslim . " Jasser believes acts of Islamic terrorism are rooted in the ideology of political Islam or Islamism . He has expressed the opinion that the 2009 Christmas Day attempted airplane bombing , the 2009 Fort Hood shooting , and the 2010 Times Square car bombing attempt have not prodded the United States into the appropriate action , but rather have resulted in politically correct denial by U.S. government authorities , and inaction by most American Muslims . He believes that even the Bush administration took inadequate measures against Islamism in America . He says the U.S. needs to provide alternatives for Muslim youth and promote reformist groups . In his television appearances , Jasser has claimed that 3 to 5 percent of U.S. Muslims are militant and 30 to 40 percent do not believe in separation of mosque and state . He also states that he believes many Western Muslim imams are too timid in their response to Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant seemingly both criticizing but also sympathizing with its goal of a caliphate stating " Clearly , the majority of the mosques in the United States are led by imams who are Islamists — who believe that in Muslim-majority countries that the state should be identified as an Islamic state . " Jasser is an outspoken supporter of Israel and believes that Muslim organizations and leaders need to be held to a litmus test to see whether they recognize Israel as a state . Jasser and a group of American Muslims founded the nonprofit American Islamic Forum for Democracy ( AIFD ) in 2003 with the goal of demonstrating the compatibility of Islam with democracy and American values . Jasser is the group 's president and chief spokesman . The AIFD supports separation of religion and state , religious pluralism , equality of the sexes , the unconditional recognition of Israel , and the creation of an independent Palestine " on the current ' occupied territories . ' " The organization rejects terrorism and any justification for it

In August 2009 , it was announced that the film would be released in the US through Apparition , a new distributor founded by River Road Entertainment head Bill Pohlad and former Picturehouse chief Bob Berney . A tentative date of December 25 , 2009 was announced , but the film was not completed in time . Organisers of the Cannes Film Festival made negotiations to secure a premiere at Cannes 2010 , resulting in Malick sending an early version of the film to Thierry Fremaux and the Cannes selection committee . Though Fremaux warmly received the cut and was eager to screen the film at his festival , Malick ultimately told him that he felt the film was not ready . On the eve of the 2010 Cannes Film Festival , Berney suddenly announced his departure from Apparition , leaving the company 's future uncertain . Pohlad decided to keep '' The Tree of Life '' at Apparition , and after significant restructuring , hired Tom Ortenberg to act as a consultant on its release . A tentative plan was made to release it in late 2010 , in time for awards consideration . Ultimately , Pohlad decided to close Apparition and sell rights to the film . Private screenings of the film to interested parties Fox Searchlight Pictures and Sony Pictures Classics took place at the 2010 Telluride Film Festival . On September 9 , Fox Searchlight announced their acquisition of the film from Pohlad 's River Road Entertainment . The film opened in limited release in the United States on May 27 , 2011
