QUERY_ANSWERS={'Johnstown Flood of 1977', '1977 flood', 'massive flood'}
QUERY_CONTEXT=The flood was preceded by rains from March 9 that did not stop until March 22 , 1936 . The storms brought warmer 50 °F ( 10 °C ) weather that was a cause of one stage of flooding and the continuous rains a second cause of flooding . The natural run-off of 1 to 3 inches ( 2.5 to 7.5 cm ) was far surpassed by the deluge of from 10 to 30 inches ( 25 to 75 cm ) of water in the region . The flood came before pending flood control legislation was enacted or any significant flood control measures implemented . The narrowness of the valleys and encroachment of buildings on the river banks contributed to record flooding . By the time nightfall came one-third of the city was under of water and by the time flooding was over twenty-five people lost their lives . The damages , estimated at $ 43 million , made it the worst flood since the flood of 1889 and the event is chronicled at the Johnstown Flood Museum After the flood , sweeping nationwide flood control laws were enacted and from 1938 to 1943 Johnstown saw many projects completed . These measures gave the people the feeling that the area was now " flood free " , and it was touted as such until the flood of 1977

		CONTEXT=In a May 2005 column in the '' Weekly Standard '' , Daveed Gartenstein-Ross wrote about his May 14 , 2005 , debate with Bray on PAX-TV 's Faith Under Fire program . He noted that a '' Chicago Tribune '' article had detailed how the fundamentalist Islamist Muslim Brotherhood operates in the US through MAS , and that MAS wants to see the US governed by sharia law . He noted that MAS , " except in its most public of statements " , was open about its agenda . He argued that while Bray " tries to portray MAS as an organization that embraces these shared liberal democratic values , the group simultaneously teaches its members that all government should become Islamic and that non-Islamic judicial systems should be boycotted . " In July 2005 , after the London bombings that killed 52 people , Bray said : " Let me say to the terrorists very clearly , that you will have no comfort in our community . Our community offers you no harbor . Our message is clear , you do no service to Islam , you do a great disservice to Islam and for the love of God , stop this madness . " When the '' Philadelphia Inquirer '' published some of the cartoons of Mohammed in the 2005 Mohammed cartoons controversy , Bray said : " This has nothing to do with free speech ; its pure sensationalism that reeks of religious disrespect . What the '' Philadelphia Inquirer '' has done is irresponsible , provocative , and reckless . " When in November 2006 , two imams from Boston-area mosques were arrested and charged with being involved in a scheme that secured religious worker visas for immigrants who instead got secular jobs , Bray said : " If this was sic clerics who were anything other than Muslims , would they have had to face this ?

QUERY_CONTEXT=In the 1959 review for '' Sight & Sound '' , David Vaughan calls '' Gigi '' " an elegant film " with a " cultivated visual taste which is everywhere apparent " . He summarises that " while '' Gigi '' does not represent a revival of the MGM musical in its heyday , it is a welcome extension of latter-day musical style in its adult subject-matter and its avoidance of spectacle made vulgar by emphasis on size . " He praises Minnelli 's talent for " the delicious amorality of the anecdote , but also the honesty and irony of its telling which have become foreign to the American cinema . " Vaughan points out " Chevalier 's practiced but irresistible charm as one of the film 's greatest assets " as well as " the brilliant high-comedy playing of Isabel Jeans , who as Aunt Alicia consummately portrays the distinction and beauty of a retired aristocrat of the '' demimonde '' . " Bosley Crowther of '' The New York Times '' called it " a musical film that bears such a basic resemblance to '' My Fair Lady '' that the authors may want to sue themselves " . He added , " But do n't think this point of resemblance is made in criticism of the film , for '' Gigi '' is a charming entertainment that can stand on its own two legs . It is not only a charming comprehension of the spicy confection of Colette , but it is also a lovely and lyrical enlargement upon that story 's flavored mood and atmosphere … Vincente Minnelli has marshaled a cast to give a set of performances that , for quality and harmony , are superb . " Abel Green of '' Variety '' called the film " 100 % escapist fare " and predicted it " is destined for a global box-office mop-up " . He added , " Alan Jay Lerner 's libretto is tailor-made for an inspired casting job for all principals , and Fritz Loewe 's tunes ( to Lerner 's lyrics ) already vie with and suggest their memorable '' My Fair Lady '' score … Miss Caron is completely captivating and convincing in the title role … Skillful casting , performance and presentation have endowed realism to the sum total … Director Minnelli 's good taste in keeping it in bounds and the general sound judgment of all concerned … distinguishes this Arthur Freed independent production . The Metrocolor rates recognition for its soft pastels under Joseph Ruttenberg 's lensing ; the Beaton costumes , sets and general production design are vivid physical assets at first sight . The skillful integration of words-and-music with the plot motivation makes this '' Gigi '' a very fair lady indeed as a boxoffice entry . " '' Time Out New York '' said , " The dominating creative contribution comes from Minnelli and Cecil Beaton … The combination of these two visual elitists is really too much — it 's like a meal consisting of cheesecake , and one quickly longs for something solid and vulgar to weigh things down . No doubt inspired by the finicky , claustrophobic sets and bric-à-brac , the cast tries ( with unfortunate success ) to be more French than the French , especially Chevalier . The exception is Gingold , who inhabits , as always , a world of her own . " '' TV Guide '' rated the film 3 ½ out of five stars , calling it " Overbaked but enjoyable , and a banquet for the eyes , thanks to the visual wonder of the Minnelli-Beaton teaming … Caron … leads the cast in a contest to see who can be the most French . The winner is Chevalier , in a performance that makes one feel as if you 're gagging on pastry … Perhaps if the sweetness of '' Gigi '' was contrasted with elements of honest vulgarity , the picture could balance itself out … Ten minutes into the movie , you 've resolved the plot and are left to wallow in lovely frou-frou . The film makes wonderful use of the usual Parisian landmarks , and benefits from extraordinary period costumes and sets . " '' Gigi '' won a record-breaking nine Academy Awards ( at the 1959 Oscars ceremony ) ; however , this record only lasted for one year , as '' Ben-Hur '' broke this record the following year with 11 Oscars . In tribute to '' Gigi '' s domination of the Oscars , the MGM switchboard answered calls the following day with " M-Gigi-M " . '' Gigi '' , eventually along with 1987 's '' The Last Emperor '' , held the record as the film ( s ) with the most Academy Award wins in every category in which it was nominated , until 2003 's '' The Lord of the Rings : The Return of the King '' broke the record at the 2004 Oscars ceremony with 11 Oscar nominations and 11 Oscar wins

		CONTEXT=Former television columnist for '' The Star-Ledger '' Alan Sepinwall expressed his boredom on the focus given on Grey 's relationships storylines while reviewing the second season 's finale : " On those occasions when Meredith 's not involved in a plot about her love life , I do kind of like her , but those moments are so infrequent compared to her constant angsting over McDreamy -- not to mention all those seemingly unrelated storylines that always turn into a metaphor for that relationship -- that I really , really ca n't stand her . " During the show 's third season , the development of the character received negative reviews , with Cristopher Monfette of '' IGN '' stating that her storyline has become " some bizarrely under-developed sub-plot about depression and giving Derek a season 's worth of reconsidering to do . " Also during the third season , Robert Rorke of the '' New York Post '' noted the decline in Meredith 's role in the show , expressing disappointment : " She used to be the queen of the romantic dilemmas , but lately , she 's been a little dopey , what with the endless McDreamy soliloquies . " Similarly , Macleans.ca found their storyline in the fourth season overused , " This whole ' Oh I need more time , ' but ' Oh , I 'm jealous if you look at someone else ' angst was tired in the second season , frustrating in the third and now a total channel changer . The will-they-or-won ' t-they plot does n't work because they 've already been in and out of that relationship too many times . Meredith is a nag and McDreamy is henpecked . " On a more positive note , her relationship with Shepherd was included in AOL TV 's list of the " Best TV Couples of All Time " and in the same list by '' TV Guide '' . During the sixth season the development of the character was praised , Glenn Diaz of '' BuddyTV '' commented that " You got ta love Mer when she 's gloomy . " , in addition to praising Pompeo 's performance . In her review of the episode Tainted Obligation she wrote " I felt for Meredith , but after Lexie 's heartfelt begging and pleading , I was happy that Mere finally grows up and casts her selfishness aside . Three seasons ago Meredith would never have dreamed of putting Lexie first , and I was proud of her for giving up part of her liver — her offer to get to know her dad was an even bigger milestone . " Reviewing the first part of the eighth season , TV Fanatic lauded the character and wrote : " this season belongs to Meredith Grey . She is the '' heart and soul of the show '' and has been outstanding . This is a character that used to be so dark and twisty and has now grown into a more mature woman . Ellen Pompeo has been at the top of her game this season . " '' Wit & Fancy '' praised the transformation of the character and stated , " Of course Meredith will still make rash decisions like when she took off with Zola or tampered with the trial , but she does things out of love and the kindness of her heart now and not because she is dark and twisty . Considering where Meredith was at the beginning and where she is now , I think she went through a remarkable journey and did more than just growing up , she finally became ' all whole and healed ' . " Maura O'Malley of '' Bustle '' also lauded the development of the character ahead of season 12 saying , " When the series began , Meredith was just a girl sitting in a bar celebrating the exciting next phase of her life . She had graduated medical school , she was starting her residency at a prestigious hospital , and she was simply looking for a no-strings attached , one night stand . What she got instead was a complicated romantic relationship that rivals Romeo and Juliet — but the key is , she was n't searching for love . Working and learning were — and continue to be — her priorities , while McDreamy was simply an added perk . Hopefully , the new season of Grey 's Anatomy will reflect this change in tone , because Meredith is a strong , independent woman — and she will be just fine . " Later in the series , Ellen Pompeo received critical acclaim with numerous critics lauding her portrayal of the character . Reviewing the episode She 's Leaving Home '' CarterMatt '' called her the " anchor " for Grey 's saying , " Throughout , this was an episode completely anchored by Ellen Pompeo , who has done some of her best work ever on the show the past couple of weeks . Tonight , she cried , she fought , and she learned that she was carrying his child . " and added that Pompeo is often " ovelooked " saying , " Her subtlety is probably why she is often overlooked . " Rick Porter of '' Zap2it '' reviewing " How to Save a Life " wrote , " Without Meredith , and without one of Pompeo 's strongest performances in her long time on the show , " How to Save a Life " would have run the risk of coming across as a baldly manipulative death episode , the likes of which the show has done several times before . He added . " How to Save a Life " may not be the ideal Emmy-submission episode for Pompeo , considering Meredith is off screen for more than half of it . But it 's among the best work she 's ever done on the show . " '' USA Today '' also lauded Pompeo saying , " In some ways , the episode ( How to Save a Life ) was even more of a showcase for Pompeo . She had some of the more memorable and well-played scenes , from her angry response to the doctor who tries to tell her what her choices are , to her resignation when she realizes she has to comfort and motivate the young doctor whose mistakes cost Derek his life . " The relation between Meredith and Cristina has been acclaimed and been a highlight of the show . Mark Perigard of the Boston Herald considered the friendship to be " the secret core of Grey 's " . Aisha Harris of '' Slate '' called their relation '' The Best Female Friendship on TV '' adding that " With those two characters , showrunner Shonda Rhimes and her team of writers created one of the most nuanced and realistic portrayals of female friendship on television . " Samantha Highfill of '' Entertainment Weekly '' called Cristina and Meredith the best female friends on TV because " they do n't try to be " . There 's nothing fake about them , which is a rarity in how female friends are portrayed on television . She further went on to call them ' soulmates ' , " And even though they 'd never dare get sappy enough to say it , they 're soul mates . Margaret Lyons of Vulture ( magazine ) called the friendship " dream BFF relationship . " and the primary focus of the show , " One of the series ' calling cards has been its depiction of female friendship and particularly the primacy that friendship enjoyed over romantic relationships . " '' E! '' at the time of Sandra Oh 's exit wrote , " In Grey 's Anatomy 's 10-year history , the doctor duo has been through a lot together : weddings , deaths , plane crashes , bomb threats , shooting , you name it , they 've lived ( and danced ) through it . " and added , " And with the three words , ' Y '' ou 're my person . '' ' Cristina Yang and Meredith Grey solidified their status as the small screen 's best best friends ever . " Marama Whyte of '' Hypable '' wrote , " Critically , the key relationship in Meredith 's life was not her romance with Derek Shepherd , but her passionate , indestructible , absolutely enviable friendship with Cristina . Talk about relationship goals ; who wants McDreamy when Cristina Yang could be your person . These two were the real powerhouse , and Shonda Rhimes did n't shy away from making the audience remember this . Derek was the love of her life , but Cristina was her soul mate . More than anyone else , Cristina challenged Meredith , was honest with her and inspired her . For these reasons , it was Cristina who was constantly the source of Meredith 's character development , not Derek . " Pompeo 's character has also been used to define the image a strong woman , '' Bustle '' previewing the 12th season wrote , " Meredith Grey has always been capable of being on her own . Grey 's Anatomy is about Meredith 's journey . Men and romantic interests are a part of her life , but they are not the priority . She does n't need McDreamy . Grey 's Anatomy does n't need McDreamy . So even if the writers do decide to create a new love interest for Ms. Grey ( Martin Henderson , perhaps ? ) , it would n't matter . I have faith that the show 's writers will do this storyline justice , because TV needs more strong single women — and Meredith seems like the perfect candidate . " The site added , " This past season was almost a trial run for a McDreamy-less Grey 's Anatomy .

On July 25 , Michele and '' Glee '' creator Ryan Murphy held a celebration of life for Monteith in Los Angeles , attended by cast , crew , and creators of the show , as well as colleagues from the show 's network and studio . After consultation with Michele , who also plays Monteith 's love interest on '' Glee '' , showrunners postponed production of '' Glee '' 's fifth season to August rather than late July . Consequently , the season premiered a week later than planned . The season 's third episode , " The Quarterback " , aired on October 10 , 2013 , and served as a tribute to Monteith , focusing on the death of his character Finn Hudson . The show then began a brief hiatus , which lasted until November 7 , 2013 , due to the extra time that was needed to decide how to proceed with the show following the death . After " The Quarterback " aired , Murphy noted that he had decided to " keep mentioning Finn ...

Hosts of the show have also been slimed , especially in recent years , and occasionally celebrities not attending the awards have been slimed via video segment , such as when Rosie O'Donnell tricked Melissa Joan Hart into getting slimed on the set of '' Sabrina the Teenage Witch '' in 2001 , or when Amanda Seyfried and Josh Hutcherson were slimed at a KCA watch party in 2013 .

Reviewing the soap opera 's first weeks , television critic Hal Boedeker of the '' Orlando Sentinel '' criticized the show for relegating the Russell family to " spend ing most of their time listening to the problems of the white Bennetts " and questioned its attempt at " racial progress . " The Russells were described as having received less screen time than other characters by '' The Baltimore Sun '' s Tamara Ikenberg , who commented that the series appeared to revolve around three families as opposed to four .

Despite the film 's limited success , Roger Ebert asserted : " Hunt in particular has fun with a wisecracking dame role that owes something , perhaps , to Rosalind Russell in '' His Girl Friday '' . " In 2003 , Hunt returned to Broadway in Yasmina Reza 's '' Life x 3 '' , and in 2004 , she starred in the drama '' A Good Woman '' , as a femme fatale in 1930s NYC . '' AV Club '' , in its review for the latter , remarked : " Helen Hunt looks embarrassingly out of place trying to play an infamous seductress " . She played a socialite , as part of an ensemble cast , in Emilio Estevez 's drama '' Bobby '' ( 2006 ) , about the hours leading up to the Robert F. Kennedy assassination . As a member of the cast , she was nominated for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Cast in a Motion Picture but won the Hollywood Film Festival Award for Best Ensemble Cast . Hunt made her feature film directorial debut in '' Then She Found Me '' ( 2007 ) , in which she also starred as a 39-year-old Brooklyn elementary school teacher , who after years is contacted by the flamboyant host of a local talk show , played by Bette Midler , who introduces herself as her biological mother . After first reading Elinor Lipman 's novel , she tried to interest numerous studios in the material , and her unsuccessful efforts led her to begin writing the screenplay and raising funds to produce it herself . Upon its release , Ruthe Stein of the '' San Francisco Chronicle '' observed , " You would think that frontloading '' Then She Found Me '' with so much plot would make it play like a soap opera . But Hunt saves the movie from this fate in two ways . First she turns in a touchingly real performance , the best of her big-screen career . Forget that '' As Good as It Gets '' won her an Oscar . She 's eons better and more realistic in this one ... By directing '' Then She Found Me '' , Helen becomes its savior as well ... Hunt knows when to rein in the Divine Miss M instead of allowing her to go into full Kabuki mode . She also coaxes pitch-perfect performances from Broderick and Firth . " Hunt starred in the dramedy '' Every Day '' ( 2010 ) , as one half of a married couple pulled apart by increasing responsibilities . According to '' Los Angeles Times '' , the film " comes as a reminder of Hunt 's talent for understatement , and a wish to see more of her " . In the biographical drama '' Soul Surfer '' ( 2011 ) , she played the mother of the Hawaiian-born champion surfer Bethany Hamilton , on whose life the film was based . Her first wide release since 2001 's '' The Curse of the Jade Scorpion '' , '' Soul Surfer '' made US$ 47.1 million internationally . Hunt starred as sex surrogate Cheryl Cohen-Greene in '' The Sessions '' ( 2012 ) , alongside John Hawkes and William H. Macy . The role required Hunt to perform multiple scenes of full-frontal nudity , on which she further said : " Being naked was challenging , but even more than that was the vulnerability . I felt vulnerable because I was naked . I felt vulnerable because we were having such a vulnerable moment in this character 's life . This was a real journey that someone had gone on , and I wanted to do right by that . " Her performance was acclaimed by critics and earned her several award nominations , including an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress . Todd McCarthy of '' The Hollywood Reporter '' wrote : " Hunt 's performance may be physically bold but is equally marked by its maturity and composure . " Hunt played research geneticist Mary-Claire King in the independent drama '' Decoding Annie Parker '' ( 2013 ) , which was released to a mixed critical response . She wrote and directed the drama '' Ride '' ( 2014 ) , in which she also starred as a mother who travels cross-country to California to be with her son after he decides to drop out of school and become a surfer . Rotten Tomatoes ' critical consensus read : " '' Ride '' reaffirms Helen Hunt 's immense acting talent — but suggests that she still needs time to develop as a director . " In '' The Miracle Season '' ( 2018 ) , based on the true story of the Iowa City West High School volleyball team , Hunt played Kathy Bresnahan , a volleyball coach

		CONTEXT=Hunt starred in Woody Allen 's '' The Curse of the Jade Scorpion '' ( 2001 ) , as an efficiency expert hypnotized by a crooked hypnotist into stealing jewels . Despite the film 's limited success , Roger Ebert asserted : " Hunt in particular has fun with a wisecracking dame role that owes something , perhaps , to Rosalind Russell in '' His Girl Friday '' . " In 2003 , Hunt returned to Broadway in Yasmina Reza 's '' Life x 3 '' , and in 2004 , she starred in the drama '' A Good Woman '' , as a femme fatale in 1930s NYC . '' AV Club '' , in its review for the latter , remarked : " Helen Hunt looks embarrassingly out of place trying to play an infamous seductress " . She played a socialite , as part of an ensemble cast , in Emilio Estevez 's drama '' Bobby '' ( 2006 ) , about the hours leading up to the Robert F. Kennedy assassination . As a member of the cast , she was nominated for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Cast in a Motion Picture but won the Hollywood Film Festival Award for Best Ensemble Cast . Hunt made her feature film directorial debut in '' Then She Found Me '' ( 2007 ) , in which she also starred as a 39-year-old Brooklyn elementary school teacher , who after years is contacted by the flamboyant host of a local talk show , played by Bette Midler , who introduces herself as her biological mother . After first reading Elinor Lipman 's novel , she tried to interest numerous studios in the material , and her unsuccessful efforts led her to begin writing the screenplay and raising funds to produce it herself . Upon its release , Ruthe Stein of the '' San Francisco Chronicle '' observed , " You would think that frontloading '' Then She Found Me '' with so much plot would make it play like a soap opera . But Hunt saves the movie from this fate in two ways . First she turns in a touchingly real performance , the best of her big-screen career . Forget that '' As Good as It Gets '' won her an Oscar . She 's eons better and more realistic in this one ... By directing '' Then She Found Me '' , Helen becomes its savior as well ... Hunt knows when to rein in the Divine Miss M instead of allowing her to go into full Kabuki mode . She also coaxes pitch-perfect performances from Broderick and Firth . " Hunt starred in the dramedy '' Every Day '' ( 2010 ) , as one half of a married couple pulled apart by increasing responsibilities . According to '' Los Angeles Times '' , the film " comes as a reminder of Hunt 's talent for understatement , and a wish to see more of her " . In the biographical drama '' Soul Surfer '' ( 2011 ) , she played the mother of the Hawaiian-born champion surfer Bethany Hamilton , on whose life the film was based . Her first wide release since 2001 's '' The Curse of the Jade Scorpion '' , '' Soul Surfer '' made US$ 47.1 million internationally . Hunt starred as sex surrogate Cheryl Cohen-Greene in '' The Sessions '' ( 2012 ) , alongside John Hawkes and William H. Macy . The role required Hunt to perform multiple scenes of full-frontal nudity , on which she further said : " Being naked was challenging , but even more than that was the vulnerability . I felt vulnerable because I was naked . I felt vulnerable because we were having such a vulnerable moment in this character 's life . This was a real journey that someone had gone on , and I wanted to do right by that . " Her performance was acclaimed by critics and earned her several award nominations , including an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress . Todd McCarthy of '' The Hollywood Reporter '' wrote : " Hunt 's performance may be physically bold but is equally marked by its maturity and composure . " Hunt played research geneticist Mary-Claire King in the independent drama '' Decoding Annie Parker '' ( 2013 ) , which was released to a mixed critical response . She wrote and directed the drama '' Ride '' ( 2014 ) , in which she also starred as a mother who travels cross-country to California to be with her son after he decides to drop out of school and become a surfer . Rotten Tomatoes ' critical consensus read : " '' Ride '' reaffirms Helen Hunt 's immense acting talent — but suggests that she still needs time to develop as a director . " In '' The Miracle Season '' ( 2018 ) , based on the true story of the Iowa City West High School volleyball team , Hunt played Kathy Bresnahan , a volleyball coach

		CONTEXT=The book is six chapters long . Chapter one is entitled " Tricky comforts a troubled citizen " . In the chapter , the citizen in question is concerned with William Calley 's killing of twenty-two Vietnamese villagers at My Lai , but he is " seriously troubled by the possibility that Lieutenant Calley may have committed an abortion " . Throughout the chapter , Dixon defends the notion that Calley may have killed a pregnant woman , covering many factors ; If the pregnant woman was showing or not , if Calley could have communicated with her , if he really did know she was pregnant , whether the woman asked Calley to give her an abortion or not , etc . Trick E. Dixon manages to defend Calley well until the citizen asks if Calley could have given her an abortion against her will , as " an outright form of murder " , and Dixon gives the following answer , which is supposed to reflect his background as a lawyer and his hard-to-pin-down nature : Well , of course , that is a very iffy question , is n't it ? What we lawyers call a hypothetical instance — is n't it ? If you will remember , we are only " supposing " there to have been a pregnant woman in the ditch at My Lai to begin with . Suppose there " was n't " a pregnant woman in that ditch — which , in fact , seems from all evidence to have been the case . We are then involved in a totally academic discussion . In chapter two , entitled " Tricky holds a press conference " , Dixon takes questions from reporters with names to suit their respective personalities . The reporters are called Mr. Asslick ( who , as his name suggests , " sucks up " to the President ) , Mr. Daring ( who poses , as suggested , the more daring suggestions in the style of investigative journalism ) , Mr. Respectful ( who acts rather meekly compared to some of his compatriots ) , Mr. Shrewd ( who , being slightly more daring than Mr. Daring , suggests President Dixon may be giving voting rights to the unborn for purely political reasons ) , Miss Charming ( the typical female reporter often stereotyped in media as ' charming ' indeed ) , Mr. Practical ( concerned not with the politics of the situation , but the when and the how much of the situation )

The latter included the establishment of the principle of equality of the parties involved , the introduction of public hearings , the jury trial , and a professional advocate that had never existed in Russia .

QUERY_CONTEXT=Perhaps the best known appearance of Cephalonia in popular culture is in the novel '' Captain Corelli 's Mandolin '' , by the English author Louis de Bernières . The book is believed to have been inspired by the village of Farsa , just outside Argostoli . The love story comprising the theme of the book is set before and after the Acqui Division massacre , during the Second World War . A film adaptation was released in 2001 . During filming there was lively debate between the production team , local authorities as well as groups of citizens , as to the complex historical details of the island 's antifascist resistance . As a result , political references were omitted from the film , and the romantic core of the book was preserved , without entering complex debates about the island 's history .

		CONTEXT=Adam Thrasher argued that the " Take Back the Night " marches cause polarization in gender relations , since women discourage men from participating . Thrasher said , as paraphrased by Dan Lazin of '' The Gateway '' , that " unthinking men may be incited to further hatred towards women . " Thrasher argued that while the strips criticize " the ideas of some hard-core feminists , " they are not against all women . Thrasher added that " The reason I did it is because it 's such a taboo to make fun of violence against women , against Take Back the Night . " Thrasher also stated that " When I drew up the cartoon , I was n't thinking about Marc Lepine and the Montreal massacre which was a crime against humanity , I think , more than a crime against women . " A Saturday October 25 , 1997 , editorial of '' The Globe and Mail '' argued that the actions against Thrasher were censorship and that " the instinct to block the juvenile humour was more disturbing than the juvenalia itself . " The '' Alberta Report '' said in 1997 that " '' Space Moose '' is a festival of caricatured scatology , violence , perversion , irreligion and even pedophilia . It has stimulated outrage before , but in five years the university had never suppressed the strip , despite lampoons of University institutions , Trekkies , the mentally retarded , and Christians . Only one group , it seems , has the clout to make the university turn censor . " In response to Thrasher 's argument that the marches could polarize gender relations and that the comic had a different message than perceived , Gretchen Hess said that the intent of the strip was not easily discernible and that the effect of the strip should be considered in addition to the intent . Linda Trimble argued that " t he pretty direct message of the cartoon was ' It 's open season on feminists . Kill all the women . " Joyce Green , a University of Regina political science professor who was another complainant , argued that " I do n't see any difference between the Montreal Massacre and the cartoon . " Green added that the group had complained about the strips " not because we 're paranoid but because we 're terrified . " Shannon Sampert , a political science student who was another one of the complainants , said that she was not surprised that the appeal went in favor of Thrasher . She believed that additional students would try to take the course of action that Thrasher took , and she believed that Feminists would cause an outcry against the appeals

		CONTEXT=Netreba was a village in Wołyń Voivodeship ( 1921 – 1939 ) , in Sarny county , gmina Kisorycze , Poland , destroyed by the UPA in July 1943 . Many of its residents converted to Roman Catholicism before the onset of the Nazi German and Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939 , which contributed to the 1943 murderous raid by the Ukrainian death squads . The few surviving Netreba refugees built dugouts in the forest where they saved themselves . The solitary church still standing at the end of the war , was dismantled soon after by the Soviet authorities and the materials used in the construction of pig - stalls in nearby kolhozs ( government - run farms ) .

		GOLD_MENTION=massacred thousands of Jews
		CONTEXT=In April 1941 , Hungarian troops , in alliance with Nazi Germany , invaded the northern Yugoslavian province of Vojvodina . After Hungary declared war on the Allied powers in 1941 , territory was annexed and officials began to persecute Jews in the region . On January 20 , 1942 , gendarmes and troops invaded Novi Sad , and two days later , gendarmes massacred thousands of Jews in their homes and around the city . Eduard Kiš was among a large group of Jews rounded up and taken by the gendarmes to the banks of the frozen Danube to be shot . Eduard managed to survive , only because the hole in the ice where the gendarmes were dumping the bodies of the dead became so clogged with bodies that the commanders called for the officers to stop the killing . Kiš later described the massacre as the start of his " conscious life "

		GOLD_MENTION=My Lai
		CONTEXT=The book is six chapters long . Chapter one is entitled " Tricky comforts a troubled citizen " . In the chapter , the citizen in question is concerned with William Calley 's killing of twenty-two Vietnamese villagers at My Lai , but he is " seriously troubled by the possibility that Lieutenant Calley may have committed an abortion " . Throughout the chapter , Dixon defends the notion that Calley may have killed a pregnant woman , covering many factors ; If the pregnant woman was showing or not , if Calley could have communicated with her , if he really did know she was pregnant , whether the woman asked Calley to give her an abortion or not , etc . Trick E. Dixon manages to defend Calley well until the citizen asks if Calley could have given her an abortion against her will , as " an outright form of murder " , and Dixon gives the following answer , which is supposed to reflect his background as a lawyer and his hard-to-pin-down nature : Well , of course , that is a very iffy question , is n't it ? What we lawyers call a hypothetical instance — is n't it ? If you will remember , we are only " supposing " there to have been a pregnant woman in the ditch at My Lai to begin with . Suppose there " was n't " a pregnant woman in that ditch — which , in fact , seems from all evidence to have been the case . We are then involved in a totally academic discussion . In chapter two , entitled " Tricky holds a press conference " , Dixon takes questions from reporters with names to suit their respective personalities . The reporters are called Mr. Asslick ( who , as his name suggests , " sucks up " to the President ) , Mr. Daring ( who poses , as suggested , the more daring suggestions in the style of investigative journalism ) , Mr. Respectful ( who acts rather meekly compared to some of his compatriots ) , Mr. Shrewd ( who , being slightly more daring than Mr. Daring , suggests President Dixon may be giving voting rights to the unborn for purely political reasons ) , Miss Charming ( the typical female reporter often stereotyped in media as ' charming ' indeed ) , Mr. Practical ( concerned not with the politics of the situation , but the when and the how much of the situation )

His grandparents were immediately taken to the crematoria and were killed . While his mother stayed in Auschwitz , Moscovich was moved to Wustegiersdorf , one of the surrounding work camps , laying rail lines . In January 1945 , Auschwitz was evacuated and Moscovich along with 60,000 prisoners marched west to Bergen-Belsen . After only a few days , Moscovich volunteered for a selection of 500 volunteer prisoner workers . These volunteers were sent to clear the railway station in Hildesheim by dislodging the wagons to free the rails so they could be fixed and used for German transports . While there , several groups found food supplies including sugar , butter , and eggs . On March 22 , Hildesheim was bombed killing or wounding both prisoners and German guards . The volunteers were made to move the bodies for easier identification . They were then marched to the Hannover-Ahlem prison camp . The prisoners worked in an asbestos mine converting it into an ammunition depot safe from aerial attacks . Hannover-Ahlem was evacuated on April 6 , 1945 and Moscovich marched towards Bergen-Belsen again . Moscovich describes the last days in Bergen-Belsen as “ the ultimate in human misery , suffering , degradation , death and humiliation . ” He hid himself among a pile of dead bodies to avoid the Germans

The love story comprising the theme of the book is set before and after the Acqui Division massacre , during the Second World War . A film adaptation was released in 2001 . During filming there was lively debate between the production team , local authorities as well as groups of citizens , as to the complex historical details of the island 's antifascist resistance . As a result , political references were omitted from the film , and the romantic core of the book was preserved , without entering complex debates about the island 's history .

Although wide in its scope it ultimately failed to achieve its objectives as ELAS fighters successfully evaded the German patrols , returning to their hideouts once the operation was over . The civilian population thus became the main target for Axis reprisals . Shortly afterwards the German 1st Mountain Division and the 4th SS Polizei Panzergrenadier Division departed from the country , while in August Army Group E declared Greece a war zone . German shops and cultural institutions were closed , while civilians and older member of the army , secret police and SS were evacuated . Under Adolf Hitler 's orders the Wehrmacht adopted the policy of total war , in response to the rise of ELAS subversive activity which had hampered the summer harvest in areas still controlled by the collaborationist government . Army Group E 's staff deemed the preceding Distomo massacre and 1 May 1944 Kaisariani executions as excessive and even damaging to the image of the occupational authorities . The staff stressed the need to arrest insurgents rather than resorting to the collective punishment of civilians . Nevertheless , those orders were disregarded and atrocities continued unhindered . Between June and August , ELAS attacks led to the death of 30 German soldiers , 14 were wounded and 9 more were missing in action . German reprisals in their turn included the execution of 254 people

		CONTEXT=198 years earlier there was a very similar event , the magnitude 5.8 – 6.0 1382 Dover Straits earthquake , with an estimated epicentre not far from that estimated for the 1580 event . Two later quakes in the Dover Strait , in 1776 and 1950 , both thought to be around magnitude 4 , were noted in the 1984 compilation by R.M.W. Musson , G. Neilson and P.W. Burton . None in this study occurred before 1727 , but the same team devoted an article to the 1580 earthquake that year , the classic study . Some scientists have suggested that the 1580 , 1776 and 1950 quakes are all linked to periodic tectonic activity that results in a tremor occurring in the Dover Straits approximately every 200 years

Incidents of the Communist Party of Thailand ( CPT ) increasingly sabotages activities in rural areas across all of Thailand and of border clashes with Cambodia and Laos incidents frequent the news headlines . The administration forceful suppressive policy actually helped emboldened the CPT ’s popularity amongst the population . Furthermore , members and close aides of the royal family also became targets of attacks by the communist insurgents , as recorded in the assault of a helicopter assassinating the queen ’s secretary and a bomb explosion in same vicinity as the king while he was visiting the south of Thailand . The country-wide deterioration and increase activities of communist incidents induced actions among the Thai armed forces . The first attempt to overthrow the Thanin administration was led by General Chalad Hiranyasiri and took place in March 1977 where the coup was unsuccessful and Chalad was executed on Thanin 's order . With increasing unrest , the Thanin government was successfully overthrew when a group of Thai military called Young Turks asked the 1976 coup leader ( the coup that ousted the elected civilian government of Seni Pramoj and appointed the current royal favorite Thanin Kraivichien as prime minister ) General Sa-ngad Chaloyu and the Supreme Commander General Kriangsak Chomanan to oust Thanin on 20 October 1977 . Chomanan was later appointed as the new Prime Minister by a majority votes through both the National Assembly and the NARC , as a new Prime Minister has not yet been selected or volunteered . 8 As Prime Minister , Kriangsak moved to modurate and neutralize his predecessor Thanin Kraivichien 's severe measures , which had driven young Thai intellectuals from multiple universities to join Communist insurgencies in the countryside . In 1978 , in a major risk to his political position with his right leaning supporting base , he submitted an amnesty bill to the National Legislative Assembly to release the leftist students and labor activist Bangkok 18 , deemed to be wrongly jailed in 1976 , in the Thammasat University Massacre . The move have greatly bolstered his international position as a South East Asian humanitarian leader as noted by commemoration from many international bodies such as that expressed by letter of congratulations from US President Jimmy Carter and Assistant Secretary of State Patricia Derian , Chief State Department official responsible for human rights and humanitarian affairs . He also started a successful amnesty program for Communists as part of a reconciliation policy . 1 As Prime Minister , Kriangsak is widely credited for defusing a long-running communist insurgency in northern Thailand . He is reported to have met in 1979 with Deng Xiaoping , then supreme leader of the People 's Republic of China , allowing China to ship arms to the rebel Khmer Rouge in Cambodia in exchange for the PRC withdrawing its support for the communist insurgency in Thailand . These reports were confirmed contemporaneously by the Sunday Times and wire services . However , claims of a deal involving the Khmer Rouge was denied by the Thai government , which cites his offer of amnesty as the primary reason for the withdrawal of communist insurgency and policy of reunifications . The other benefit of the deal with China for Thailand was that it would not have Vietnamese troops on its border . In the same way Kriangsak had secret deals with rebel armies across the border in Burma , which provided a buffer zone against Burmese aggression

		CONTEXT=After the Christchurch Earthquakes of 2010 and 2011 some doubt over obtaining sufficient reinsurance cover for further earthquakes , plus lack of exact figures from the government 's EQC to indicate how much of the earthquakes ' insurance costs would have to come from '' ' Allied Mutual Insurance ' '' ( AMI ) , led to uncertainty over the insurer 's financial state . The New Zealand government talked of bailing out the company up to $ 1000 million because of the chaos that would ensue if it collapsed , and eventually agreed to a NZD 500 million support deed , but large losses led to a NZD 76 million shortfall of its NZD 198.6 million regulatory capital requirement and so forced the controversial sale of AMI , to the New Zealand arm of Australia and New Zealand 's largest insurance group , IAG . IAG NZ already had acquired major insurance names in New Zealand , such as NZI ( formerly New Zealand Insurance ) and State Insurance , and with acquiring AMI 's business ( other than Christchurch earthquake-related work ) IAG covered 60 % of the domestic insurance market

Contest organisers sent a questionnaire regarding the voting system to participating broadcasters , and a reference group incorporated the responses into their suggestions for next year 's format . Telewizja Polska ( TVP ) , the Polish broadcaster , suggested that an international jury similar to the one used in the 2008 Eurovision Dance Contest be introduced in the Eurovision Song Contest to lessen the impact of neighbourly voting and place more emphasis on the artistic value of the song . A jury would lead to less political and diaspora voting as the jury members , mandated to be music industry experts , would also have a say in addition to " random members of the public "

The program was widely criticized by the pentecostal movements of Finland in its early days for allegedly promoting Satanist attitudes , even though the program has never contained any Satanist music at all . The whole channel was even boycotted for a time by all kinds of Christian denominations due to " glorifying secularism and sacrilegious attitudes and spoiling the lives of young , innocent children and the youth of Finland " and the boycott was backed with the classic claims of backmasking having revealed hidden messages . At the time it was a widely believed stereotype that all metal and rock music was of the Satanist attitude , though these beliefs were mostly broken after the Eurovision Song Contest victory of Finnish heavy metal band Lordi in 2006 , which made metal music mainstream

In previous years , countries that received a top 10 placing were automatically granted a spot in the next year 's final without having to compete in a semi-final , but for 2008 , the EBU changed the automatic qualification regulations so that all countries except the " Big 4 " ( France , Germany , Spain , and the United Kingdom ) and host country , would have to pass through one of two semi-finals . The EBU split up countries with a friendly voting history into separate semi-finals , to give a better chance for other countries to win . Greece and Cyprus had often been accused of favoring each other , with each awarding the other the maximum number of points ( twelve ) at the previous contest . On January 28 , 2008 , the EBU held a special draw which determined that Greece would be in '' Semi-final 1 '' held on May 20 , 2008 in Belgrade , Serbia ; Cyprus was subsequently placed in the second semi-final

		CONTEXT=As the title says , only rock and heavy metal videos are played in this program block . The program was widely criticized by the pentecostal movements of Finland in its early days for allegedly promoting Satanist attitudes , even though the program has never contained any Satanist music at all . The whole channel was even boycotted for a time by all kinds of Christian denominations due to " glorifying secularism and sacrilegious attitudes and spoiling the lives of young , innocent children and the youth of Finland " and the boycott was backed with the classic claims of backmasking having revealed hidden messages . At the time it was a widely believed stereotype that all metal and rock music was of the Satanist attitude , though these beliefs were mostly broken after the Eurovision Song Contest victory of Finnish heavy metal band Lordi in 2006 , which made metal music mainstream

		CONTEXT=Although Greece had been granted a spot in the 2008 final because of its seventh-place finish at the Eurovision Song Contest 2007 , it had to compete in a semi-final for the first time since 2004 because of new rules put into effect by the European Broadcasting Union ( EBU ) . In previous years , countries that received a top 10 placing were automatically granted a spot in the next year 's final without having to compete in a semi-final , but for 2008 , the EBU changed the automatic qualification regulations so that all countries except the " Big 4 " ( France , Germany , Spain , and the United Kingdom ) and host country , would have to pass through one of two semi-finals . The EBU split up countries with a friendly voting history into separate semi-finals , to give a better chance for other countries to win . Greece and Cyprus had often been accused of favoring each other , with each awarding the other the maximum number of points ( twelve ) at the previous contest . On January 28 , 2008 , the EBU held a special draw which determined that Greece would be in '' Semi-final 1 '' held on May 20 , 2008 in Belgrade , Serbia ; Cyprus was subsequently placed in the second semi-final

		CONTEXT=As the title says , only rock and heavy metal videos are played in this program block . The program was widely criticized by the pentecostal movements of Finland in its early days for allegedly promoting Satanist attitudes , even though the program has never contained any Satanist music at all . The whole channel was even boycotted for a time by all kinds of Christian denominations due to " glorifying secularism and sacrilegious attitudes and spoiling the lives of young , innocent children and the youth of Finland " and the boycott was backed with the classic claims of backmasking having revealed hidden messages . At the time it was a widely believed stereotype that all metal and rock music was of the Satanist attitude , though these beliefs were mostly broken after the Eurovision Song Contest victory of Finnish heavy metal band Lordi in 2006 , which made metal music mainstream

QUERY_CONTEXT=Duane Allman created the idea of having two lead guitarists , which was inspired by Curtis Mayfield ; " he wanted the bass , keyboards , and second guitar to form patterns behind the solo rather than just comping , " said Allman . Their style and incorporation of guitar harmonies was very influential on later musicians . " The pair also had a wide range of complementary techniques , often forming intricate , interlocking patterns with each other and with the bassist , Berry Oakley , setting the stage for dramatic flights of improvised melodies . " Dickey Betts ' playing was very melody-based ; " My style is just a little too smooth and round to play the blues stuff straight , because I 'm such a melody guy that even when I 'm playing the blues , I go for melody first , " he said . His listening of country and string bluegrass growing up influenced this considerably : " I played mandolin , ukulele , and fiddle before I ever touched a guitar , which may be where a lot of the major keys I play come from . " He later characterized their style as " question and answer , anticipation and conclusion , " which involved allowing each musician 's downbeat to arrive in a different spot , while also keeping consideration of the bass guitar lines . The group also held an improvisational approach to live performances , which connected the band with jam band culture . " Jazz and blues musicians have been doing this for decades , but I think they really brought that sense that anyone onstage can inspire anyone else at any given time to rock music , " said Haynes . " We sure did n't set out to be a " jam band " but those long jams just emanated from within the band , because we did n't want to just play three minutes and be over , " said Allman . '' Rolling Stone '' referred to the group as " without question the first great jam band , and they took the jam to heights that it had not previously reached . " The Allman Brothers Band were considerably influential within the Southern United States . Their arrival on the musical scene paved the way for several other notable Southern rock bands — among those Lynyrd Skynyrd , the Marshall Tucker Band and Wet Willie — to achieve commercial success , and also " almost single-handedly " made Capricorn Records into " a major independent label . " Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top , writing for '' Rolling Stone '' , wrote that the group " defined the best of every music from the American South in that time . They were the best of all of us . " He went on to call the band " a true brotherhood of players — one that went beyond race and ego . It was a thing of beauty . " The band 's extended popularity through heavy touring in the early 1990s created a new generation of fans , one that viewed the Allmans as pioneers of " latter-day collegiate jam rock . " AllMusic praised the band 's history : " they went from being America 's single most influential band to a shell of their former self trading on past glories , to reach the 21st century resurrected as one of the most respected rock acts of their era . " In 2012 , an official historic marker was erected on the site of the July 1970 Second Atlanta International Pop Festival near Byron , Georgia . The Allman Brothers Band had played two sets at the festival , which was a significant event in their career . The marker text reads , in part : " Over thirty musical acts performed , including ... Macon 's Allman Brothers Band on their launching pad to national fame . " Official sponsors of the marker included the Georgia Allman Brothers Band Association , The Allman Brothers Band Museum at the Big House , and '' Hittin ' the Note '' . In 2003 , the band released a recording of their festival opening and closing performances , '' Live at the Atlanta International Pop Festival : July 3 & 5 , 1970 ''

QUERY_CONTEXT=In a positive review for '' Cuepoint '' , Robert Christgau argued that while Azalea may never demonstrate a powerful , soulful , or attractively melodic delivery , her " striving Australian-Atlantan cadence " is original and carries every song . He deemed ' ' The New Classic '' " plenty authentic -- and damn good to boot " while dismissing Azalea 's media naysayers : " predictably , the songs where she expresses wonderment that ' Impossible Is Nothing ' are more relatable than the ones where she flaunts her liquid assets . But the ones where she pledges to keep on striving are more relatable than that , because striving is built into her flow itself . That 's what her complexity is about . " Phil Johnson from '' The Independent '' called it " an instantly engaging showcase of the 23-year-old Aussie 's talents – poppy without diluting her fierce-flowing charisma . " Kellan Miller of '' XXL '' said despite some poor songs near the end of the record , it is " a persuasive indicator that Iggy Azalea will be around for the long haul . " '' The New Classic '' was named one of the best hip-hop albums of the year by '' XXL '' on a list published on 30 June 2014 , adding that " the album proved to a gang of skepts who doubted Iggy 's controversial style from the start that she was more than capable of making hip-hop tracks with a pop appeal . " It was placed at number twenty-five on Digital Spy 's top albums of 2014 and listed among Fuse 's 40 best albums of 2014 . The album won the Breakthrough Artist Release award at the 2014 ARIA Music Awards and Favorite Rap/Hip-Hop Album at the 2014 American Music Awards , beating out Drake 's '' Nothing Was the Same '' and Eminem 's '' The Marshall Mathers LP 2 '' . It received a nomination for Best Rap Album at the 57th Grammy Awards . The album was also up for Top Rap Album at the 2015 Billboard Music Awards

		CONTEXT=On October 8 , 2015 , Spears posted on her Instagram account a picture of herself with British producer and DJ Burns , hinting a possible collaboration . At the time , the producer had production credits with Ellie Goulding , Pitbull and Calvin Harris , among others . In another picture with the producer , she also captioned American musician Mischke . Prior to their studio meeting , the producer had worked on the instrumental part of the track , mixing organic elements with " electronic stuff " , as well as playing guitar , thus creating what would become " Make Me " . Later , British songwriter Joe Janiak created the song 's melody , and after meeting with Burns they created parts of the song 's lyrics . Spears ' team then contacted the producer , claiming that they loved the track and they met to record it . As stated by Burns , " The vocal was one of my main focuses on this one because I wanted it to feel like there was some kind of emotion in that , which is n't necessarily in a lot of the most recent singles that she did . I wanted to steer away from that autotune kind of sound and have something much more natural sounding , so we spent a lot of time on the vocal and just getting it to where it sounded like she 's actually singing it from the heart rather than it being too much production . I think we 've achieved that . " It was initially announced by '' Las Vegas Sun '' that the song — titled " Make Me ( Oooh ) " at the time — would be released in May 2016 , with Spears being scheduled to perform the single at the 2016 Billboard Music Awards , followed by an album release in June . However , due to production difficulties , the track was reported to be delayed until the summer , with no release date being provided . Robin Leach from the '' Las Vegas Sun '' claimed he was told that , " She 's gone from pretty straight-forward pop to a really interesting vibe with a lot of really cool stuff . " Later , on May 25 , 2016 , it was reported that American rapper G-Eazy was going to be featured on the track , which was the rumoured reason for the delay . On July 14 , 2016 , the single 's cover art was released . It shows " her toned body while walking through the desert wrapped in a white piece of fabric " and wearing a " pair of thigh-high boots . " The song was released on July 15 , 2016 on the iTunes Store as a digital download . It was also released to a limited range of radio stations for early airplay and made available across streaming platforms the following day . It was serviced to contemporary hit radio on July 19 , 2016 . On August 29 , 2016 , RCA sent a studio version of the 2016 VMA Performance for pop radio called " VMA Eazy Remix "

QUERY_ANSWERS={'Caltavuturo massacre'}
QUERY_CONTEXT=According to many scholars , the name and origin of the town are traced back to the period of Arab rule . According to Ibn al-Athir ( '' The Complete History '' , VII .370.5 – 7 ) , in AH 268 ( 881/82 CE ) , the Aghlabid commander Abū Ṯawr was defeated by the Byzantines ( probably commanded by the '' strategos '' Mosilikes ) and his was army annihilated , with only seven men surviving . The locality was later named in Arabic '' Qalʿat Abī Ṯawr '' ( " Castle of Abū Ṯawr " ) , which is the origin of the modern name . Others instead maintain that the name derives from the Arabic word " qal ' at " ( fortress ) and the Sicilian " vuturu " ( vulture ) meaning of " fortress of vultures . " The town existed under Byzantine rule pre Arab conquest as Aziz Ahmad in “ A Islamic History of Sicily ” ( edinburgh university press 1975 ) states that in 852 Abbas raided Caltavuturo in the northern part of the Island and took many prisoners who were sold as slaves , The town was the site of the so-called Caltavuturo massacre on 20 January 1893 , when local authorities killed 13 and wounded 21 peasants that had occupied communal land that they claimed was theirs

Already since the early summer of 1943 , German troops had been pouring into Greece , fearing an Allied landing there ( in fact falling victims to a grand-scale Allied strategic deception operation , " Operation Barclay " ) . Soon they became involved in wide-ranging counterguerrilla operations , which they carried out with great ruthlessness , based on their experiences in Yugoslavia . In the course of these operations , mass reprisals were carried out , resulting in war crimes such as at Kommeno on August 16 , the Massacre of Kalavryta in December and the Massacre of Distomo in June 1944 . At the same time , hundreds of villages were systematically torched and almost one million people left homeless

Eduard Kiš was among a large group of Jews rounded up and taken by the gendarmes to the banks of the frozen Danube to be shot .

		CONTEXT=In 1941 , Yugoslavia surrendered unconditionally to the Axis powers during World War II . Hungary occupied Vojvodina . In January 1942 , Moscovich 's father was a victim of the Novi Sad massacre . His father died at age 44 . In 1943 , Hungary started secret armistice negotiations with the Allied Powers which was discovered by Germany resulting in the German occupation of Vojvodina . Soon after , at the age of 17 , Moscovich was taken to the concentration camp at Auschwitz with his grandfather , grandmother and mother . His grandparents were immediately taken to the crematoria and were killed . While his mother stayed in Auschwitz , Moscovich was moved to Wustegiersdorf , one of the surrounding work camps , laying rail lines . In January 1945 , Auschwitz was evacuated and Moscovich along with 60,000 prisoners marched west to Bergen-Belsen . After only a few days , Moscovich volunteered for a selection of 500 volunteer prisoner workers . These volunteers were sent to clear the railway station in Hildesheim by dislodging the wagons to free the rails so they could be fixed and used for German transports . While there , several groups found food supplies including sugar , butter , and eggs . On March 22 , Hildesheim was bombed killing or wounding both prisoners and German guards . The volunteers were made to move the bodies for easier identification . They were then marched to the Hannover-Ahlem prison camp . The prisoners worked in an asbestos mine converting it into an ammunition depot safe from aerial attacks . Hannover-Ahlem was evacuated on April 6 , 1945 and Moscovich marched towards Bergen-Belsen again . Moscovich describes the last days in Bergen-Belsen as “ the ultimate in human misery , suffering , degradation , death and humiliation . ” He hid himself among a pile of dead bodies to avoid the Germans

		CONTEXT=The starost or starosta ( Cyrillic : старост / а , Latin : capitaneus , ) is a Slavic term denoting a community elder whose role was to administer the assets of a clan or family estates . The Slavic root of starost translates as " senior " . Since the Middle Ages , it has meant an official in a leadership position in a range of civic and social contexts throughout the Slavic world . In terms of a municipality , a starosta was historically a senior royal administrative official , equivalent to the County Sheriff or the outdated Seneschal , and analogous to a gubernator . In Poland , a starosta would administer crown territory or a delineated district called a starostwo .

In January 1945 , Auschwitz was evacuated and Moscovich along with 60,000 prisoners marched west to Bergen-Belsen . After only a few days , Moscovich volunteered for a selection of 500 volunteer prisoner workers . These volunteers were sent to clear the railway station in Hildesheim by dislodging the wagons to free the rails so they could be fixed and used for German transports . While there , several groups found food supplies including sugar , butter , and eggs . On March 22 , Hildesheim was bombed killing or wounding both prisoners and German guards .

		CONTEXT=The book is six chapters long . Chapter one is entitled " Tricky comforts a troubled citizen " . In the chapter , the citizen in question is concerned with William Calley 's killing of twenty-two Vietnamese villagers at My Lai , but he is " seriously troubled by the possibility that Lieutenant Calley may have committed an abortion " . Throughout the chapter , Dixon defends the notion that Calley may have killed a pregnant woman , covering many factors ; If the pregnant woman was showing or not , if Calley could have communicated with her , if he really did know she was pregnant , whether the woman asked Calley to give her an abortion or not , etc . Trick E. Dixon manages to defend Calley well until the citizen asks if Calley could have given her an abortion against her will , as " an outright form of murder " , and Dixon gives the following answer , which is supposed to reflect his background as a lawyer and his hard-to-pin-down nature : Well , of course , that is a very iffy question , is n't it ? What we lawyers call a hypothetical instance — is n't it ? If you will remember , we are only " supposing " there to have been a pregnant woman in the ditch at My Lai to begin with . Suppose there " was n't " a pregnant woman in that ditch — which , in fact , seems from all evidence to have been the case . We are then involved in a totally academic discussion . In chapter two , entitled " Tricky holds a press conference " , Dixon takes questions from reporters with names to suit their respective personalities . The reporters are called Mr. Asslick ( who , as his name suggests , " sucks up " to the President ) , Mr. Daring ( who poses , as suggested , the more daring suggestions in the style of investigative journalism ) , Mr. Respectful ( who acts rather meekly compared to some of his compatriots ) , Mr. Shrewd ( who , being slightly more daring than Mr. Daring , suggests President Dixon may be giving voting rights to the unborn for purely political reasons ) , Miss Charming ( the typical female reporter often stereotyped in media as ' charming ' indeed ) , Mr. Practical ( concerned not with the politics of the situation , but the when and the how much of the situation )

		CONTEXT=Watson has said that Hermione is a character who makes " brain not beauty cool , " and that though Hermione is " slightly socially inept , " she is " not ashamed of herself . " When filming '' Chamber of Secrets '' , Watson was " adamant " that she was n't like Hermione , but she reflects that " as I got older , I realised she was the greatest role model a girl could have . " In 2007 , before the release of '' Order of the Phoenix , '' Watson said , " There are too many stupid girls in the media . Hermione 's not scared to be clever . I think sometimes really smart girls dumb themselves down a bit , and that 's bad . When I was nine or ten , I would get really upset when they tried to make me look geeky , but now I absolutely love it . I find it 's so much pressure to be beautiful . Hermione does n't care what she looks like . She 's a complete tomboy . " Screenwriter Steve Kloves revealed in a 2003 interview that Hermione was his favourite character . " There 's something about her fierce intellect coupled with a complete lack of understanding of how she affects people sometimes that I just find charming and irresistible to write . " In '' Harry Potter and the Cursed Child '' , Hermione Granger is played by the South African-born actress Noma Dumezweni , also known for her work in '' Linda '' , '' A Raisin in the Sun '' and '' A Human Being Died That Night '' . Dumezweni described the role as a " privilege and a responsibility " and said that " we all aspire to be Hermione . " The choice of a black actress to play the part led to criticism on social media , which J.K. Rowling described as being by " a bunch of racists " , adding that the books never explicitly mentioned her race or skin colour , and that she has been portrayed as black in fan art . Emma Watson also expressed her support for the actress , tweeting that she looked forward to seeing her in the role . Dumezweni herself called the backlash " so unimaginative " , stating that " So many young actors and actresses have told me that they ’re so pleased I ’m playing Hermione because they can see a version of themselves on the stage . " Dumezweni received praise for her performance ; '' The Independent '' commented that she " did a tremendous job as the stern witch . " At the 2017 Laurence Olivier Awards , Dumezweni received the Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role for her portrayal of Hermione

" When filming '' Chamber of Secrets '' , Watson was " adamant " that she was n't like Hermione , but she reflects that " as I got older , I realised she was the greatest role model a girl could have . " In 2007 , before the release of '' Order of the Phoenix , '' Watson said , " There are too many stupid girls in the media . Hermione 's not scared to be clever . I think sometimes really smart girls dumb themselves down a bit , and that 's bad . When I was nine or ten , I would get really upset when they tried to make me look geeky , but now I absolutely love it . I find it 's so much pressure to be beautiful . Hermione does n't care what she looks like . She 's a complete tomboy . " Screenwriter Steve Kloves revealed in a 2003 interview that Hermione was his favourite character . " There 's something about her fierce intellect coupled with a complete lack of understanding of how she affects people sometimes that I just find charming and irresistible to write . " In '' Harry Potter and the Cursed Child '' , Hermione Granger is played by the South African-born actress Noma Dumezweni , also known for her work in '' Linda '' , '' A Raisin in the Sun '' and '' A Human Being Died That Night '' . Dumezweni described the role as a " privilege and a responsibility " and said that " we all aspire to be Hermione . " The choice of a black actress to play the part led to criticism on social media , which J.K. Rowling described as being by " a bunch of racists " , adding that the books never explicitly mentioned her race or skin colour , and that she has been portrayed as black in fan art . Emma Watson also expressed her support for the actress , tweeting that she looked forward to seeing her in the role . Dumezweni herself called the backlash " so unimaginative " , stating that " So many young actors and actresses have told me that they ’re so pleased I ’m playing Hermione because they can see a version of themselves on the stage . " Dumezweni received praise for her performance ; '' The Independent '' commented that she " did a tremendous job as the stern witch . " At the 2017 Laurence Olivier Awards , Dumezweni received the Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role for her portrayal of Hermione

Although Pennsylvania had outlawed slavery , many conservative Pennsylvanians believed that the federal government should not interfere with the institution of slavery . One such individual was Democrat James Buchanan , the last pre-Civil War president . Buchanan 's party had generally won presidential and gubernatorial elections in Pennsylvania . However , the nascent Republican Party 's first convention took place in Philadelphia , and the 1860 elections saw the Republican Party win the state 's presidential vote and the governor 's office . After the failure of the Crittenden Compromise , the secession of the South , and the Battle of Fort Sumter , the Civil War began with Pennsylvania as a key member of the Union . Despite the Republican victory the 1860 election , Democrats remained powerful in the state , and several " copperheads " called for peace during the war . The Democrats re-took control of the state legislature in the 1862 election , but incumbent Republican Governor Andrew Curtin retained control of the governorship in 1863 . In the 1864 election , President Lincoln narrowly defeated Pennsylvania native George B. McClellan for the state 's electoral votes

		GOLD_MENTION=Republican Presidential nomination
		CONTEXT=While the early scenes of Lincoln 's life are remarkably accurate , much of the later scenes contain historical inaccuracies . The famous Lincoln-Douglas debates , in addition to the historically accurate topic of the extension of slavery , have been turned into an argument about secession . Lincoln was famously an underdog for the Republican Presidential nomination in 1860 ; in the film it is suggested he is the sole nominee as a result of the Lincoln-Douglas debates . The outbreak of the Civil War seems to be the Union firing on Charleston , South Carolina from Fort Sumter , rather than the other way around . Also , early in hostilities , General Winfield Scott is depicted as being overconfident of a quick victory ( and something of a buffoon ) , when in reality he was one of the voices in the minority claiming the war would be long , costly , and bloody . Lincoln receives a report from the Secret Service that some copperheads in the North have issued threats against him . The Secret Service was not created until two months after Lincoln 's death . Finally , in the climax of the film , Lincoln delivers a conflation of famous words from the Gettysburg Address and Second Inaugural Address at Ford 's Theatre on April 14 , 1865 – just moments before being assassinated . This was Griffith 's second portrayal of Lincoln 's assassination , the first being in '' The Birth of a Nation ''

		CONTEXT=The first official Republican convention in Illinois was held on May 29 , 1856 , in Bloomington . Chairman John M. Palmer was elected convention president after his opening address . Nine vice presidents and five secretaries were then elected . The convention nominated Bissell for governor with Francis Hoffmann as lieutenant governor , Ozias M. Hatch for secretary of state , Jesse K. Dubois as auditor , and James Miller as treasurer . Hoffmann was found to be ineligible for his position due to a residency requirement , and John Wood was nominated in his place . The following resolutions defining the party platform were approved : Resolved , That foregoing all former differences of opinions upon other questions , we pledge ourselves to unite in opposition to the present administration and to the party which upholds and supports it and to use all honorable and constitutional means to wrest the Government from the unworthy hands which now control it and to bring it back in its administration to the principles and practices of Washington , Jefferson and their great and good compatriots of the Revolution . Resolved , That foregoing all former differences of opinions upon other questions , we pledge ourselves to unite in opposition to the present administration of the Government ; that under the Constitution Congress possesses the power to prohibit slavery in the Territories ; and that , whilst we will maintain all constitutional rights of the South , we also hold that justice , humanity , the principles of freedom as expressed in our Declaration of Independence and our national constitution , and the purity and perpetuity of our Government require that that power shall be exerted to prevent the extension of slavery into territory heretofore free . Resolved , That the repeal of the Missouri Compromise was unwise and injurious ; an open and aggravated violation of the plighted faith of the States , and that the attempt of the present administration to force slavery into Kansas against the known wishes of the legal voters of that Territory is an arbitrary and tyrannous violation of the rights of the people to govern themselves , and that we will strive by all constitutional means to secure to Kansas and Nebraska the legal guaranty against slavery of which they were deprived at the cost of the violation of the plighted faith of the nation . Resolved , That we are devoted to the Union and will , to the last extremity , defend it against the efforts now being made by the dis-unionists of this administration to compass its dissolution , and that we will support the Constitution of the United States , in all its provisions regarding it , as the sacred bond of our Union and the only safeguard for the preservation of the rights of ourselves and our posterity . Resolved , That we are in favor of the immediate admission of Kansas as a member of this Confederacy under the constitution adopted by the people of said Territory . Resolved , That the spirit of our institutions as well as the Constitution of our country , guarantees the liberty of conscience as well as political freedom , and that we will proscribe no one by legislation or otherwise on account of religious opinions , or in consequence of place of birth . Lincoln delivered the closing address . The speech was purportedly so captivating that no reporter made a record of it . The address has become known as Lincoln 's Lost Speech . The delegates to the convention were : The Democrats had nominated Richardson for governor at their convention earlier that month . The remnants of the Whig party declined to run a candidate . The first Republican National Convention met that June , nominating John C. Fremont for president . Fremont was defeated handily in his bid for president , including in Illinois , but the Republican state ticket in Illinois was successful . Bissell became the first Governor from a party other than the Democrats since 1838 . Republicans would win every subsequent gubernatorial election through 1893

		CONTEXT=At an open mic night , Tenacious D are performing " Training Melody " to an indifferent crowd , one of whom says they suck ( Dan Harmon ) . After the show , they get a message from Michael Keaton as himself , saying that the time-space continuum has been disrupted in the Ford 's Theater in 1850 . After they travel there , they discover Abraham Lincoln ( Justin Roiland ) walked out of his play due to hating it , therefore preventing his assassination . Kyle Gass attempts to convince him to get shot and bribes him with seven cents , which he thinks is a thousand dollars there , but Abraham refuses . The two confront the Time Goblin ( JR Reed ) who staged the scenario so he could confront Tenacious D and take their " time machine " ( a normal-looking car with time-travel capabilities , much like the DeLorean time machine ) . They fight , and the Time Goblin wins . He ties them into the presidential party box so John Wilkes Booth will assassinate them instead and takes the time machine . The two break free and discover Abraham is willing to get shot , since he discovered from Kyle 's seven cents his face is on the future penny and is grateful . When Jack and Kyle realize they still do not have a time machine , they discover H.G. Wells , who has the time machine from his book and they leave with it

Resolved , That we are devoted to the Union and will , to the last extremity , defend it against the efforts now being made by the dis-unionists of this administration to compass its dissolution , and that we will support the Constitution of the United States , in all its provisions regarding it , as the sacred bond of our Union and the only safeguard for the preservation of the rights of ourselves and our posterity .

During the U.S. Presidential campaign of 1844 , he gave stump speeches for Henry Clay due to the Whig Party 's platform that opposed admitting Texas into the Union because it was a slave state . In the U.S. Presidential campaign of 1848 , Gibson supported Whig candidate , " Rough and Ready " General Zachary Taylor . However , he was concerned about the Whig Party 's lack of opposition to the abolition of slavery and personally visited Henry Clay at his home in Ashland , Kentucky in 1848 to discuss this issue . He lost as a Whig candidate for Ohio Attorney General in 1853 . In 1853 , following the large defeat of the Whig candidate General Winfield Scott in the U.S. Presidential election of 1852 , Gibson threw his support to the Free Soil Party and began organizing what would become the Republican Party in Ohio .

The ninth ballot , after some initial suspense , saw delegation after delegation break for Harding , who took the lead with 374 votes to 249 for Wood and 121 for Lowden ( Johnson had 83 ) . Lowden released his delegates to Harding , and the tenth ballot , held at 6 p.m. , was a mere formality , with Harding finishing with 672 votes to 156 for Wood . The nomination was made unanimous . The delegates , desperate to leave town before they incurred more hotel expenses , then proceeded to the vice presidential nomination .

Many at the convention voted for McAdoo anyway , and a deadlock ensued with Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer . On the 44th ballot , the Democrats nominated Governor Cox for president , with his running mate Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt . As Cox was , when not in politics , a newspaper owner and editor , this placed two Ohio editors against each other for the presidency , and some complained there was no real political choice .

		CONTEXT=During the 1840s , Bowser painted banners for a diverse range of clients , including the Know Nothing Party , and received a commission to paint the portrait of prominent abolitionist and real estate developer Jacob C. White . Active in that decade 's efforts to repeal the clause in Pennsylvania 's Constitution which prohibited blacks from voting , Bowser and his family also became so involved with the abolition movement that their home became a stop on the Underground Railroad . In 1858 , politics and advocacy merged with art when Bower painted the portrait of abolitionist John Brown while Brown was visiting the Bowser home . During this same period , Bowser also completed work on his painting , '' The Firebell in the Night '' . In addition , he was also active , during this phase of his life , with the Grand United Order of Odd Fellows . As Grand Master of the Order in Philadelphia , he delivered the keynote address at the Annual Moveable Committee of the G.U.O. of O.F. in Toronto , Canada on October 17 , 1859 as its members celebrated the organization 's thirteenth anniversary . According to news reports , he was " listened to throughout with much attention , and was frequently rapturously applauded " as he " defined in eloquent terms the nature of the work of Odd Fellows — especially that great and leading principle , Charity , " and " remarked upon the practical good effected by Odd Fellowship , in alleviating distress and bestowing many of the comforts of life upon the aged and infirm of the Order , as well as conferring benefactions upon the widow and orphan . " Bowser 's work on the first banner was paid for through a commission awarded by the Contraband Relief Association ( CRA ) , an organization headed by Elizabeth Keckley , the formerly enslaved woman who became Mary Todd Lincoln 's dressmaker . It was then presented by the CRA to the leaders of 1st United States Colored Infantry . With respect to the other Bowser-designed battle flags , historians at the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission note that : " The 127th and 3rd regiments marched carrying banners reading ' We will prove ourselves men ' and ' Rather Die Freemen , Than Live To Be Slaves . ' Beneath these , black soldiers protect white women representing Columbia , the symbol of the republic . The 45th 's banner , proclaiming ' One Cause , One Country , ' shows a black soldier proudly holding an American flag in front of a bust of George Washington as black troops fight in the background . The 24th 's banner shows a black soldier ascending a hill , his arms outstretched in prayer , beneath the words ' Let Soldiers in War , Be Citizens in Peace . ' " For the 22nd USCT banner , Bowser depicted a black soldier pointing " a bayonet at the chest of a Confederate who has allowed his flag to fall and who is tossing aside his sword , " beneath the words , " Sic semper tyrannis " ( " thus always to tyrants " ) , a phrase which would come to have an entirely different meaning two years later when shouted by John Wilkes Booth after his assassination of Lincoln at Ford 's Theater

		CONTEXT=Here also was the old second building of the famous Maryland Institute ( then a college founded 1826 , of various curriculums including mechanical arts besides today 's art and design for which it is now world-famous ) , which was built on brick arches above a second markethouse with two large clock towers at each end in 1851 , and held an additional large assembly hall/auditorium and classrooms on the second floor . This was one of the largest and notable buildings in America at that time , and was the site of several pre-Civil War national political party conventions ( when Baltimore preceded Chicago as the common compromise city for presidential nominations , where both candidates Millard Fillmore and Franklin Pierce were nominated to be President . Another famous President , Abraham Lincoln gave his " Liberty Speech " ( also known as the " Baltimore Address " ) on April 18 , 1864 , at the " Sanitary Fair " event , one of several held throughout the Civil War-torn nation , to raise money for the support and assistance of wounded soldiers , widows and orphans and other domestic needs by the United States Sanitary Commission , ( a precursor to the later American Red Cross ) . Although he passed through Baltimore numerous times , it was the only occasion that the 16th President spoke in the city . He noted the calmer differences in the southern-oriented city , especially then three years after the secessionist tumult resulting in the disastrous Pratt Street Riots of April 19 , 1861 which had solidified Baltimore 's reputation and nickname as " Mobtown " . It was also the only time that he spoke alive in the city although having traveled through several times in his earlier brief congressional career and presidential administration . The Maryland Institute and the second markethouse below was unfortunately destroyed and lost near the end of the Great Baltimore Fire of February 7 – 8 , 1904 , on the eastern edge of the blaze along with the rest of the downtown Baltimore business district in the Nation 's third largest conflagration ever to hit an American city ( Chicago 's Great Fire of 1871 was first , followed by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire )

		CONTEXT=In basketball , small ball is a style of play that sacrifices height , physical strength and low post offense / defense in favor of a lineup of smaller players for speed , agility and increased scoring ( often from the three - point line ) . It is closely tied to the concepts of pace and space , which pushes the speed of the offense and spreads out the defense with extra shooters on the court . Many small ball lineups feature a non-traditional center who offers skills that are not normally found from players at that position . Teams often move a physically dominant player who would typically play the small forward position into the power forward position . Examples of players who have been used in this role include Kevin Durant , Carmelo Anthony , and LeBron James . That individual would play alongside either a traditional power forward ( shifted into the center position ) , or alongside a center .

QUERY_CONTEXT=He arrived at the club as an incredibly shy and underdeveloped personality , a fact that was noted by teammate Trent Cotchin who said though Martin was 18 “ he seemed much younger in some of the ways he behaved . ” Indeed , he struggled initially to adjust to the expectations of professional football . In one incident in the 2010 preseason he was removed from training and verbally reprimanded by club leadership when he was deemed unfit to train after a big night out . Despite these struggles , his on-field development was such that he would still debut in the 2010 season 's opening match , a 56-point Richmond loss against at the MCG . Martin recorded the sixth most disposals of any Tiger ( 18 ) to go along with four marks , three tackles and three clearances . Two weeks later Martin was convicted by the AFL tribunal for a high hit on Sydney 's Josh Kennedy in round 3 . He did not receive a suspension for the incident however , returning to football the following week . After four matches Martin ranked fourth in the league for clearances and eighth for hard-ball gets . Media reports emerged after round 8 that the 18 year old Martin had received a significant contract offer from expansion club the Greater Western Sydney Giants . The offer , which the Herald Sun ’s Mark Robinson claimed to be worth $ 2.4 million over three seasons , would have taken effect in the new club 's first AFL season in 2012 . Martin later said he had never entertained the idea of moving to the start-up club . In round 10 he had gained attention for his on-field efforts again , this time being nominated for the 2010 AFL Rising Star award after a 21 disposal and 11 clearance match against Port Adelaide . Due to his previous tribunal conviction however , Martin was ruled ineligible for the award and thus did not officially place in the end of season award 's points tally . He drew the attention of Sydney coach Paul Roos by round 14 , prompting Roos to send veteran Brett Kirk onto Martin in a tagging role . Despite this extra attention , he still managed to record 18 disposals and a goal in the match at the MCG . After 17 rounds Martin ranked second at the club for clearances and inside 50s as well as third for disposals and contested possessions . At the same time he ranked first among that season 's Rising Star nominees in clearances , contested possessions and inside 50s . He was also fourth for average disposals and fifth for average tackles . In round 19 he was rested by the club before returning to play out the final five matches of the season . He missed just that one game in his debut season and finished the year ranked second at Richmond for clearances and inside 50s , as well as third for both contested possessions and disposals .

QUERY_CONTEXT=" Motivation " is a R&B slow jam song written by Richard Butler ( Rico Love ) , Jim Jonsin , Dwayne Carter and Danny Morris . The racy lyrics center around Rowland asking her man to use his hands all over her body , and are accompanied by a " synth-saturated beat " produced by Jonsin . In terms of instruments , " Motivation " uses sparse keyboard notes , programmed beats and pulsing synths in the chorus . Wayne adds a rap verse complementing Rowland 's seductive suggestions , using the kitchen and a car as metaphors for sex . According to Scott Shetler from AOL Music , Rowland uses the lyrics to promise " to be her lover 's motivation . " Rowland called the record a mixture between dance and mash-up . When asked by MTV what Rowland thought of the song , she said , " It has that personality and characteristic to it that I do n't think anybody can deny . That 's why when Wayne dropped that insane verse on there ... I was like , ' You really brought that up even more . ' He went into the studio and just did it . I do n't think it takes much for Wayne to think . He just does it . He 's so admirable . " Ryan Brockington , from the '' New York Post , '' was amongst the first to review " Motivation . " In his review , he said " The single is a big leap from the dance club synth pop that Kelly has been releasing the past year and it seems like she might be trying to shimmy her way back into the hip-hop world by teaming up with the Midas touch vocals of Lil Wayne . " Both '' Rap-Up '' and AOL Music 's Scott Shetler called the song " sexy . " Becky Bain from Idolator disliked the song for not being memorable . The short review was summed up with the closing phrase , " she ’s going to need another hit to help promote her album when it finally is ready to drop . " Wesley Case from '' The Baltimore Sun '' complemented the song 's sexy quality . " If this is n't the year 's hands-down sexiest song thus far , it has to be in the discussion . Rowland , whose sultry voice could get a priest hot , weaving in and out of the minimal beat , and setting the table for Lil Wayne 's stuttering , after-hours guest-verse . Stack the pieces together and it 's an understated knockout that gets sexier with each spin . " Billboard ranked it number five on their " Critics ' Picks : 20 Best Songs of 2011 " " Motivation " was nominated for two awards at the 2011 Soul Train Music Awards including Best Dance Performance and Song of the Year.It won the award for Song of the Year and was also nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration at the 54th Grammy Awards , which was held on February 12 , 2012

'' The Beginning '' 's third single was announced on The Black Eyed Peas ' official website on May 9 , 2011 .

Check it out ! " , said Will . " Then I go dirty Caribbean on him on the last verse . " Monica Herrera wrote for '' Billboard '' that " the music is expertly produced , but problems arise when Will.i.am claims the same of his wordplay . On the track ' Do n't Stop the Party ' , he chest-thumps , ' Kill you with my lyricals/Call me verbal criminal . ' It 's a silly boast for an artist who clearly focuses on beats over rhymes , and is probably better off for it . " Andy Gill wrote for '' The Independent '' that " with martial synth-stomp riffs , spartan electro beats and loping bass grooves driving tracks whose single-mindedness is signalled by titles like ' Do n't Stop the Party ' . " A positive review came from Bill Lamb , editor from About.com , who went to say that : " BEP boost the beat as they request ' Do n't Stop the Party ' . " Lamb said that " will.i.am starts talking about futurism here again and sure enough we find ourselves in the middle of a futuristic sounding trance break . The party reaches its peak about five minutes into the song , and it is exhilarating . " Other positive reaction came from John Bush , editor from Allmusic who went to say that the song is a " scattered moment of respectability " and chose it as an " AMG Pick " . Gavin Martin wrote for '' Daily Mirror '' that " the operatically ambitious ' Do n't Stop the Party ' gives way to a briefly terrifying interlude that is more or less a declaration of earth-shaking sonic war .

		GOLD_MENTION=S7 Airlines Flight 778
		CONTEXT=Rasputin 's daughter Maria died in the 2006 crash of S7 Airlines Flight 778 , and his wife died six years later . He died in Moscow on 14 March 2015 , a day short of his 78th birthday . Patriarch Kirill of the Russian Orthodox Church conducted his funeral service , and President Vladimir Putin paid his respects . ( In 2014 Rasputin had co-signed a letter by writers in support of Putin 's annexation of the Crimea . ) Rasputin is closely associated with a movement in post-war Soviet literature known as " village prose , " or sometimes " rural prose " ( деревенская проза ) . Beginning in the time of the Khrushchev Thaw ( оттепель ) , village prose was praised for its stylistic and thematic departures from socialist realism . Village prose works usually focused on the hardships of the Soviet peasantry , espoused an idealized picture of traditional village life , and implicitly or explicitly criticized official modernization projects . Rasputin 's 1979 novel '' Farewell to Matyora '' , which depicts a fictional Siberian village which is to be evacuated and cleared so that a hydroelectric dam can be constructed further down the Angara River , was considered the epitome of this genre . The opening paragraph below is a good example of Rasputin 's writing style ( exceptional even for the village prose writers ) , and the novel 's theme of natural cycles disrupted by modernization : '' Once more spring had come , one more in the never-ending cycle , but for Matyora this spring would be the last , the last for both the island and the village that bore the same name . Once more , rumbling passionately , the ice broke , piling up mounds on the banks , and the liberated Angara River opened up , stretching out into a mighty , sparkling flow . Once more the water gushed boisterously at the island ’s upper tip , before cascading down both channels of the riverbed ; once more greenery flared on the ground and in the greens , the first rains soaked the earth , the swifts and swallows flew back , and at dusk in the bogs the awakened frogs croaked their love of life . It had all happened many times before . '' ( From Rasputin 's novel '' Farewell to Matyora '' , translated by Antonina W.

QUERY_CONTEXT=And Japan was eager to take every opportunity . In 1869 they took advantage of the defeat of the rebels of the Republic of Ezo to incorporate definitely the island of Hokkaido to Japan . For centuries , Japan viewed the Ryukyu Islands as one of its provinces . In 1871 the Mudan incident happened : cannibal Taiwanese aborigines murdered 54 Ryūkyūan sailors that had their ship shipwrecked . At that time the Ryukyu Islands were claimed by both Qing China and Japan , and the Japanese interpreted the incident as an attack on their citizens . They took steps to bring the islands in their jurisdiction : in 1872 the Japanese Ryukyu Domain was declared , and in 1874 a retaliatory incursion to Taiwan was sent , which was a success . The success of this expedition emboldened the Japanese : not even the Americans could defeat the Taiwanese cannibals in the Formosa Expedition of 1867 . Very few gave it much thought at the time , but this was the first move in the Japanese expansionism series . Japan occupied Taiwan for the rest of 1874 and then left owing to Chinese pressures , but in 1879 it finally annexed the Ryukyu Islands . In 1875 Qing China sent a 300-men force to subdue the Taiwanese cannibals , but unlike the Japanese the Chinese were routed , ambushed and 250 of their men were killed ; the failure of this expedition exposed once more the failure of Qing China to exert effective control in Taiwan , and acted as another incentive for the Japanese to annex Taiwan .

		CONTEXT=The History of the Imperial Japanese Navy ( IJN ) begins when it was first formed in 1868 . The new military subsequently underwent changes as the new Meiji government became more organized , while adapting national policy with available resources . During the 1870s , failed in engage in significant expansion . This was due in part to the domestic turmoil such as peasant and samurai uprisings faced by the nascent Meiji government and financial difficulties , as acquiring a large navy was an expensive proposition . Consequently , the IJN concentrated on developing its officer corps and the training of its personnel . However , in the early 1880s , in the aftermath of the Imo Incident in 1882 and with internal threats to its security eliminated , the Meiji government undertook the first significant naval expansion in Japan 's history . The IJN developed plans for the expansion of the fleet to forty - two vessels , thirty - two of which would have to be newly constructed . Between 1882 and 1884 , twelve new vessels were purchased or put under construction . Spurred on by anxieties over China , Japanese military expenditures grew steadily in the 1880s . In 1880 the share of military spending had amounted to 19 percent of total government expenditures , in 1886 it had risen to 25 percent and by 1890 it stood at 31 percent .

		CONTEXT=The Imperial Japanese Navy was created in 1868 , initially the officers and sailors who manned the new navy reflected the composition of the Meiji government 's bureaucracy . Samurai who originated from the victorious coalition of south - western domains dominated the navy 's small officer corps . These domains which had led the restoration , particularly Satsuma , also dominated the numbers of recruits sent to the new Naval Academy which had opened in October 1869 . The leadership of the new navy later took steps to reform recruitment into the officer corps , and to establish the creation of a system of recruitment based on merit rather than on class or region . In 1871 , the government announced that applicants would be accepted from the public at large and that entry would be based upon competitive examinations . Eventually , in the words of Arthur Marder , the Imperial Japanese Navy turned out officers of " unquestioned professional competence , fanatical courage , and extraordinary elan " . The IJN molded among the ranks a standard of discipline , self - sacrifice , and devotion to duty that became the envy of all navies in the world . Japan 's later victories at sea , one commentator has observed , " came as much from the training and morale of the average Japanese seaman as from the effectiveness of the navy 's ships or the caliber of its guns " .

		GOLD_MENTION=Stalin 's deadly purges
		CONTEXT=Wasilewska at times favoured incorporation of Poland into the Soviet Union as a republic . She explained away Stalin 's deadly purges by arguing that death of an innocent person was preferable to the risk of demise of the Soviet Union . The persecutions and victims , she felt , were an unavoidable cost of future progress or resulted from licentious conduct by functionaries . She intervened when Poles whom she knew were deported to distant regions of the Soviet Union and engaged in relief activities , such as sending parcels to deportees . Wasilewska 's interventions freed her fellow Polish communists ( kept in detention by Lavrentiy Beria even after the official amnesty for Poles negotiated by the government of Władysław Sikorski ) , the poet Broniewski and his by then estranged wife Janina Broniewska . Broniewska , who went to Moscow and worked for '' Nowe Widnokręgi '' , took care of Wasilewska'a daughter Ewa during Wasilewska 's lengthy involvement at the German front . When the Polish People 's Army was formed , Wasilewska and Broniewska pushed for the use as an emblem on soldier uniforms and elsewhere of a crownless Piast eagle taken from the restored sarcophagus of Bolesław III Wrymouth , a medieval ruler of Poland . The crownless eagle , contrary to the previously and historically used eagle with a crown , was accepted for the army and remained in exclusive use as the coat of arms of Poland throughout the period of existence of the Polish People 's Republic ( 1945 – 89 )

He spent much of the period from 1937 to 1951 imprisoned in forced - labor camps in the arctic region of Kolyma , due in part to his having supported Leon Trotsky and praised the anti- Soviet writer Ivan Bunin . In 1946 , near death , he became a medical assistant while still a prisoner . He remained in that role for the duration of his sentence , then for another two years after being released , until 1953 . From 1954 to 1978 , he wrote a set of short stories about his experiences in the labor camps , which were collected and published in six volumes , collectively known as Kolyma Tales . These books were initially published in the West , in English translation , starting in the 1960s ; they were eventually published in the original Russian , but only became officially available in the Soviet Union in 1987 , in the post - glasnost era . The Kolyma Tales are considered Shalamov 's masterpiece , and " the definitive chronicle " of life in the labor camps .

The militia groups for each district of East Timor were even more ruthless than the Indonesian military in most cases . Often , they knew their victims , and in many well-documented cases they had known their victims their entire lives , usually coming from the same villages or neighborhoods . The Aitarak gained the most notoriety , because they were the main militia group in the capital city and Dili district as a whole . It was here where international press were most present , and then the reports were mostly about what happened in Dili itself , and therefore with the Aitarak . Cases such as the Liquiçá Church massacre , and the Suai Church massacre , as well as Catholic nuns that were killed in Lospalos were largely unknown for a time

		CONTEXT=Azerbaijan then finished its Right of Reply saying that the second statement from Armenia was again " full of distortions and outright lies and against the spirit of the General Debate at the UN . " They referred to the official statistics of Armenia which apparently suggested the population is 99.9 % of one titular nation ( the delegate sarcastically laughed ) which had been achieved through " ethnic cleansing , " which was the Azeri point . Azerbaijan supports the withdrawal of all " illegal armed formations from its territory and all foreign military unlawfully stationed in the territory of Azerbaijan . It would be more appropriate if the representative of Armenia did not misinterpret the substance of the peace process and the proposals of the Minsk Group . The Armenian representative trying to misinterpret is not reality , including the OSCE 's principle set for the territorial integrity of states . At any rate , it is in the best interest of the UN and the international community if the illegal use of force is terminated and good neighbourly regions in our region could be a reality . " Pakistan responded to India 's reply from the previous day in saying that India 's attempts to " deny the illegal occupation of Jammu and Kashmir is a travesty to history . India deployed over 700,000 forces and is the only occupier which would oppose the UNGA resolution calling for the self-determination . There have been over 100,000 Kashmiris killed , hundreds of women are widows or have been raped , children too , in the state terrorism by India . There are over 6,000 mass graves in Indian-occupied Kashmir . If India has respect for international law , it would withdraw troops and let Kashmiris decide their future in accordance with a UN mandated plebiscite to determine their future . Numerous resolutions declare that the final disposition of Jammu and Kashmir be in accordance of the will of the people by a free and impartial plebiscite by impartial the auspices of the UN . This can not be cast aside by rhetoric , on top of talks between India and Pakistan in accordance with UNSC resolutions . It is the genius of India to oppose peace initiatives proclaimed by the Pakistani prime minister here . Instead India puts preconditions on a one-point agenda process and is not interested in genuine dialogue . Pakistan is , however committed . Using the bogey of terrorism obfuscates the issue . Pakistan takes part in the fight against terrorism and the world is aware except India . India is insensitive and India masks support of terrorism in Pakistan . India fails to bring the perpetrators to justice such as in the Samjhauta bombings . " Pakistan also cited a swami accused of terrorism against Muslims and the " sad story of massacre of Muslims in Gujarat , fomenting terrorism in Pakistan including in Balochistan and Karachi , security and intelligence links especially with the Taliban in FATA . Yet , they said , despite India 's " hostile attitude " Pakistan supports dialogue between the two countries and remains steadfast in pursuing such initiatives , in accordance with the new prime minister taking office two years ago . They hoped India responds to the " cherishes of our peoples . " Iran then responded to calling the " Israeli regime 's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 's smokescreen to hide his crimes against the Palestinian people . He allocated major parts of speech to attack all members of international community for supporting the JCPOA . Je and his cronies are expected to continue basking by keeping everyone else busy with phony issues . " They then asked : Why keep Palestinians under occupation ? " The Israeli regime gives ISIS support in Syria ( amidst the Syrian civil war ) and keeps tensions high in the region . They keep tensions rising because peace and stability is an existential threat . If quiet is back in the spotlight , they would have to explain their actions in the Palestinian Territories and engage in a peace process which for the past 25 years has had no result . Thus it is understandable why Israel was so angry with the ' nations ' in the hall and the whole international community . Meanwhile , Iran is committed to its obligations under the JCPOA to bring stability and peace to the region . " They concluded in saying that " we will see more angry representatives of Israel year after year in this hall . " Serbia responded to Albania 's speech earlier in the day in saying that in order to achieve the consolidation of international peace , Serbia invests in regional cooperation and stabilization . The delegate added that " unfortunately the prime minister of Albania abused the UNGA body and misled the UN members states that a dialogue is being conducted by the two states of Kosovo and Serbia and not Belgrade and Pristina . Kosovo is not an independent state and member of the UN . Thus the call to recognise Kosovo is in contravention of international law against the UN charter . " Serbia further noted that such a comment " happened at a time of an important improvement between Serbia and Albania as reflect by the first Albanian leader 's visit to Serbia in 68 years as a result of the Brussels dialogue , helped by the EU between Belgrade and Pristina . Such comments can thus jeopardise and set back future dialogue . Serbia 's southern province is one of its government 's top priorities . An effort should be made to reach a solution that is acceptable to all and take into account all communities of Kosovo and Metohija

		GOLD_MENTION=The Beatles stopped playing live
		CONTEXT=" I remember reading about how The Beatles stopped playing live , because everyone just screamed though all the shows " , noted Jon Bon Jovi . " Musicianship and song quality meant so little to the fans that the band just felt undervalued . You know what ? I understand what they mean . It got so bad when we toured for '' Slippery When Wet '' that there were times I was freaking out … We indulged in everything that was on offer . But it was n't real , and what I wanted above all else was to be given credit for the work I put into the songs and into the recording … The problem was that I did n't notice how the image overtook what we were about . " Of the omission of recordings from this tour from '' One Wild Night Live 1985 – 2001 '' , Jon Bon Jovi remarked : " It makes sense for the '' Slippery '' tour not to be represented , because at that time I was dosed up on cortisone and my voice was shot . Back then , it was n't much of a voice . " Cinderella supported at the majority of shows on the North American leg of the tour . In mainland Europe , Queensrÿche was the support . For the UK leg , support came from the British band FM on all dates except for the last three for which Queensrÿche was the support act

After his season at HC Valpellice , Valiquette signed with Swedish club Djurgården of the HockeyAllsvenskan league , but instead retired due to injury

		ANSWER=NA_RETRIEVER
		GOLD_MENTION=Airblue Flight 202
		CONTEXT=Among the plausible explanations of the cause of the crash is a failure in crew resource management ( CRM ) A steep trans-cockpit authority gradient may have meant that the First Officer did not challenge , intervene , or correct the Captain 's mistakes . This may have occurred due to skills comparison . Other aircraft crashes which have been partly explained by a steep trans-cockpit authority include Airblue Flight 202 and Merpati Nusantara Airlines Flight 8968 . In Flight 222 , First Officer Chiang did not challenge any of Captain Lee 's errors . He did not voice any concerns over the actions that Captain Lee took . It would have also increased the probability of Captain Lee making decisions without consulting the first officer . The aircraft 's impact with terrain was a direct consequence of the captain descending the aircraft below the published Minimum Descent Altitude for the runway 20 VOR approach procedure . Moreover , it was also as a result of poor planning by the crew . During the landing approach , the actions of the flight crew progressively increased the risk of a controlled flight into terrain ( CFIT ) . The crew seemed unaware that an impact with terrain was almost certain until the final two seconds

The failure of a jackscrew on a McDonnell Douglas MD-80 , resulting from a lack of grease , brought down Alaska Airlines Flight 261 in 2000 . The destruction of a jackscrew on a Boeing 747-400F , brought down National Airlines Flight 102 in 2013 . This flight had just departed Bagram Airfield when a MRAP armoured vehicle broke loose and slid through the rear bulkhead , severing hydraulics lines and most importantly , destroying the jackscrew , rendering the aircraft uncontrollable

		GOLD_MENTION=Airblue Flight 202
		CONTEXT=Among the plausible explanations of the cause of the crash is a failure in crew resource management ( CRM ) A steep trans-cockpit authority gradient may have meant that the First Officer did not challenge , intervene , or correct the Captain 's mistakes . This may have occurred due to skills comparison . Other aircraft crashes which have been partly explained by a steep trans-cockpit authority include Airblue Flight 202 and Merpati Nusantara Airlines Flight 8968 . In Flight 222 , First Officer Chiang did not challenge any of Captain Lee 's errors . He did not voice any concerns over the actions that Captain Lee took . It would have also increased the probability of Captain Lee making decisions without consulting the first officer . The aircraft 's impact with terrain was a direct consequence of the captain descending the aircraft below the published Minimum Descent Altitude for the runway 20 VOR approach procedure . Moreover , it was also as a result of poor planning by the crew . During the landing approach , the actions of the flight crew progressively increased the risk of a controlled flight into terrain ( CFIT ) . The crew seemed unaware that an impact with terrain was almost certain until the final two seconds

		CONTEXT=During the summer of 2011 , Valiquette turned down an offer to return to Lokomotiv Yaroslavl , due to a lack of guaranteed playing time . This proved fortunate for him , in light of the Lokomotiv Yaroslavl plane crash , which killed nearly the entire team and staff . Unsigned and not playing , it was announced in November 2011 that Valiquette , who runs a goalie school of his own , was taking a position at Quinnipiac University as the volunteer goalie coach for the men 's NCAA team . However , a couple of days later , the AHL 's Bridgeport Sound Tigers , for whom Valiquette had played while in the Islanders ' system , put out a call for an emergency backup , as they were shorthanded due to injuries with their Islanders parent club . Ultimately , Valiquette wound up not having to play for the Sound Tigers , and moved on to play for HC Valpellice of the Italian Serie A league , which in 14 games , he led in save percentage and goals against average . After his season at HC Valpellice , Valiquette signed with Swedish club Djurgården of the HockeyAllsvenskan league , but instead retired due to injury

		CONTEXT=Regarding the neo-Nazi Admiral Duncan pub bombing in 1999 by David Copeland , Murray wrote in the '' Morning Star '' : " Everything about this episode strikes me as odd . It happened during a war i.e. the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia that is not going particularly well " , and alleged that some neo-Nazi groups " may very well have been established with MI5 or Special Branch connivance . And certainly the state — or groups within the security apparatus — is more than capable of manipulating deranged human-haters without the latter even noticing that they are being manipulated . " Murray told '' The Times '' in 2019 : " As I wrote at the time my speculations were no more than ' conjecture and supposition ' . There is no basis for any suggestion that the bombing of the Admiral Duncan was the responsibility of anyone other than David Copeland . " Murray is considered an apologist for Joseph Stalin by his critics , such as Nick Cohen . Described as an " admirer " in '' The Independent on Sunday '' in 2003 , in 1999 he wrote in his '' Morning Star '' column : In 1999 , Murray said of KGB spy Melita Norwood : " She herself says that she has no regrets and I do not see why she should .

I would under no circumstances condone anyone acting as Melita Norwood did today . " In 2008 , Murray identified " one of the successes " of the " nationalities policy of the Soviet Union " as being the promotion of " the cultural , linguistic and educational development of each ethnic group , no matter how small or how historically marginalised . " This comment was criticised by author Edward Lucas in '' The Guardian '' who accused Murray of ignoring " the Chechens , Crimean Tatars and other victims of Stalin 's murderous deportation policies . " In a short history of the CPGB , published in 1995 , Murray wrote : " That things happened in the USSR which were inexcusable and which ultimately prejudiced Socialism ’s whole prospect is today undeniable . Whether Communists in the capitalist world could or should have done more than they did is much more contentious " . Oliver Kamm , in '' The Times '' commented in 2016 : " In short , Mr Murray believes that British communists in the 1930s were justified in backing the Great Terror , the Moscow Trials and the Ukraine famine . Mr Murray predictably supports the most nightmarish totalitarian state in the modern world " . Murray was a critic of David Miliband in his role as Foreign Secretary , arguing that his stance on the 2008 Georgian crisis revealed him as a ' neoconservative ' whose approach had ' made it abundantly clear where he stands on the great divide in world politics today . He is for the US empire '

' At the 2010 Quds Day rally in Tehran , Iranian President Ahmadinejad again predicted the demise of Israel , stating , " If the leaders of the region do not have the guts , then the people of the region are capable of removing the Zionist regime from the world scene . " He dismissed any Israeli military threat to Iran 's nuclear program , declaring , " The Zionist regime is nothing and even its ( Western ) masters are too small to conduct any kind of aggression against Iran and the rights of the Iranian people . " Ahmadinejad also proclaimed new peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians as " stillborn and doomed . " The tens of thousands of Iranians participating in the rallies continued the regular chants of " Death to America ! Death to Israel ! " The day before the rallies , Ayatollah Khamenei tweeted , " Israel Is A Hideous Entity In the Middle East Which Will Undoubtedly Be Annihilated . " In Lebanon , the day after the resumption of direct peace negotiations between Israel and Palestine , Hassan Nasrallah , Hezbollah secretary-general , declared that : Our nation can not ignore and forget this cause ( al-Quds ) because it is part of our religion , our religious commitment , our culture , our civilization , our morals and values and our past history . ... No one has the right to give up one span of its land , one grain of its sacred sand , one drop of its water , or one letter of its name . Al Quds Day is the day for announcing this ideological , legal , historic true constant position . On this day we make the announcement that neither al-Quds nor even one of its streets nor even a neighbourhood of its neighbourhoods – and not only all of al-Quds - may be an eternal capital for the so called state of Israel . Al Quds is the capital of Palestine , and as we have said in the past , it is the capital of earth and the capital of heaven one way or another .

The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack , which killed at least 65 people and wounded 160

Al-Quso is reported to have appeared in a video released by AQAP ‘ threatening to strike the U.S. homeland embassies and warships . " A picture of al-Quso surfaced with a Yemeni journalist Arafat Mudabish , who interviewed him for a story . Mudabish reports that " he lives in an isolated mountain area where there is no Yemeni government presence . " He was also linked with the 2009 Christmas bombing over Detroit , as suspected bomber Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab visited him to discuss the plot and the workings of the bomb . Al-Quso was from the same tribe as radical U.S.-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki , who had an operational role in the attack . On December 7 , 2010 the United States Department of State designated al-Quso as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist under Executive Order 13224 which “ blocks all al-Quso ’s property interests subject to U.S. jurisdiction and prohibits U.S. persons from engaging in transactions for the benefit of al-Quso . ” “ He was also placed on the United Nations ( UN ) 1267 list of persons associated with al Qa’ida and the Taliban requiring all UN member states to implement an assets freeze , a travel ban , and an arms embargo against this individual . ” Fahd Mohammed Ahmed al-Quso was killed by a CIA drone 's missile in Yemen on May 6 , 2012 , as he exited a vehicle alongside another operative .

		GOLD_MENTION=the Lockerbie bombing
		CONTEXT=On 4 October 2009 , Fred Halliday , Emeritus Professor of International Relations at the LSE and the School 's leading expert on the Middle East , wrote a memorandum to the LSE Council regarding the proposed cooperation with the Gaddafi Foundation . " I have repeatedly expressed reservations about formal educational and funding links with that country . " While those in favour of accepting the donation argued that " Libya is changing internally , " most informed observers agree that while some of the worst excesses for the moment have ceased , the rights of its people are badly protected . Libya " remains a country run by a secretive , erratic and corrupt elite . " Since 9/11 the Libyan government has reached compromises with the West on a number of issues , notably the Lockerbie bombing and nuclear weapons . Yet tactical changes in foreign policy are not sufficient for the purposes of evaluating political and academic links . There are also ways in which Libyan foreign policy has '' not '' changed : the country continues to call for the destruction of Israel ; Muammar Gaddafi recently called for the abolition of Switzerland , and he receives the leader of the Somali pirates operating off the Horn of Africa as honoured guests of state . Moreover , Libya 's handling of the Lockerbie bombing " has not been characterised by either consistency or clarity , " I have in the past , Halliday noted , defended accepting grants from authoritarian regimes such as the Gulf states , " but there should be clear limits on this , depending on the degree of political and human rights abuses perpetrated with them and on their ongoing foreign policy conduct . " Whitehall and the City are now happy to do business with Libya , but it does not follow that the LSE should do the same . Responsible leaders throughout the Middle East continue to express reservations regarding Libya , including " its more prominent ' liberal ' representatives . " We must remember , Halliday concluded , that the " liberal " wing within a regime such as Libya does not have the function of producing change but its role is instead " to reach compromises with internal hard-liners that serve to lessen external pressure . " A good case in point are the proposals LSE now is considering . It is , as LSE alumni in positions of responsibility in the region caution , " far too early for the School to take this step . " In 2009 , Human Rights Watch was allowed entry to Libya , via Saif al-Islam Gaddafi 's non-profit organization in order to gather facts about the human rights situation there . While HRW reported that there were concerns about the " repressive atmosphere , " they felt there were signs of " improvement " and Sarah Leah Whitson , director of HRW 's Middle East division said that one should not " underestimate the importance of the efforts made so far " by Gaddafi in the realm of human rights in Libya . She also wrote of her official visit that " the real impetus for the transformation rests squarely with a quasi-governmental organization , the Qaddafi Foundation for International Charities and Development " chaired by Gaddafi . She praised Gaddafi for establishing the country 's two semi-private newspapers , and said " it is impossible to underestimate the importance of the efforts made so far . Let 's hope this spring will last . " In January 2011 , HRW criticised other organisations as well as governments that had previously dealt with Gaddafi . HRW Business and Human Rights Director Arvind Ganesan condemned the London School of Economics ( LSE ) for allowing " abusive and corrupt officials or their families to launder their images in exchange for money " . This was later followed by Ganesen saying that " the London School of Economics did not act until Saif al-Islam 's father literally began to kill his own people " . According to NGO Monitor , this was despite the fact that David Held , Co-Director of LSE Global Governance , was partially influenced by Whitson 's remarks regarding her Libyan visit , referring to Saif al-Islam Gaddafi as a reformer

The Russian authorities were unlikely to label random attacks on people of non-Russian ethnicity as racist , preferring calling it " hooliganism " . The number of murders officially classified as racist more than doubled in Russia between 2003 and 2004 . The violence included acts of terrorism such as the 2006 Moscow market bombing which killed 13 people . In 2007 , 18-year-old Artur Ryno claimed responsibility for 37 racially motivated murders in the course of one year , saying that " since school he hated people from the Caucasus . " On 5 June 2007 , an anti-Chechen riot involving hundreds of people took place in the town of Stavropol in southern Russia . Rioters demanded the eviction of ethnic Chechens following the murder of two young Russians who locals believed were killed by Chechens . The event revived memories of a recent clash between Chechens and local Russians in Kondopoga over an unpaid bill , when two Russians were killed .

		CONTEXT=In early 2013 , Gosling announced that he was taking a break from acting , stating , " I 've lost perspective on what I 'm doing . I think it 's good for me to take a break and reassess why I 'm doing it and how I 'm doing it . And I think this is probably a good way to learn about that .

The " fantasy noir " , written by Gosling , stars Christina Hendricks , Ben Mendelsohn , and Matt Smith . The film received largely unfavorable reviews .

" Peter Travers of '' Rolling Stone '' said : " Gosling , a virtuoso of verbal sleaze , talks directly to the camera , and he 's volcanically fierce and funny . " The following year , Gosling starred in the black comedy '' The Nice Guys '' , opposite Russell Crowe , and in Damien Chazelle 's musical '' La La Land '' , for which he won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and received his second Academy Award for Best Actor nomination .
