		ANSWER=Lockerbie bombing
		GOLD_MENTION=the Lockerbie bombing
		CONTEXT=On 4 October 2009 , Fred Halliday , Emeritus Professor of International Relations at the LSE and the School 's leading expert on the Middle East , wrote a memorandum to the LSE Council regarding the proposed cooperation with the Gaddafi Foundation . " I have repeatedly expressed reservations about formal educational and funding links with that country . " While those in favour of accepting the donation argued that " Libya is changing internally , " most informed observers agree that while some of the worst excesses for the moment have ceased , the rights of its people are badly protected . Libya " remains a country run by a secretive , erratic and corrupt elite . " Since 9/11 the Libyan government has reached compromises with the West on a number of issues , notably the Lockerbie bombing and nuclear weapons . Yet tactical changes in foreign policy are not sufficient for the purposes of evaluating political and academic links . There are also ways in which Libyan foreign policy has '' not '' changed : the country continues to call for the destruction of Israel ; Muammar Gaddafi recently called for the abolition of Switzerland , and he receives the leader of the Somali pirates operating off the Horn of Africa as honoured guests of state . Moreover , Libya 's handling of the Lockerbie bombing " has not been characterised by either consistency or clarity , " I have in the past , Halliday noted , defended accepting grants from authoritarian regimes such as the Gulf states , " but there should be clear limits on this , depending on the degree of political and human rights abuses perpetrated with them and on their ongoing foreign policy conduct . " Whitehall and the City are now happy to do business with Libya , but it does not follow that the LSE should do the same . Responsible leaders throughout the Middle East continue to express reservations regarding Libya , including " its more prominent ' liberal ' representatives . " We must remember , Halliday concluded , that the " liberal " wing within a regime such as Libya does not have the function of producing change but its role is instead " to reach compromises with internal hard-liners that serve to lessen external pressure . " A good case in point are the proposals LSE now is considering . It is , as LSE alumni in positions of responsibility in the region caution , " far too early for the School to take this step . " In 2009 , Human Rights Watch was allowed entry to Libya , via Saif al-Islam Gaddafi 's non-profit organization in order to gather facts about the human rights situation there . While HRW reported that there were concerns about the " repressive atmosphere , " they felt there were signs of " improvement " and Sarah Leah Whitson , director of HRW 's Middle East division said that one should not " underestimate the importance of the efforts made so far " by Gaddafi in the realm of human rights in Libya . She also wrote of her official visit that " the real impetus for the transformation rests squarely with a quasi-governmental organization , the Qaddafi Foundation for International Charities and Development " chaired by Gaddafi . She praised Gaddafi for establishing the country 's two semi-private newspapers , and said " it is impossible to underestimate the importance of the efforts made so far . Let 's hope this spring will last . " In January 2011 , HRW criticised other organisations as well as governments that had previously dealt with Gaddafi . HRW Business and Human Rights Director Arvind Ganesan condemned the London School of Economics ( LSE ) for allowing " abusive and corrupt officials or their families to launder their images in exchange for money " . This was later followed by Ganesen saying that " the London School of Economics did not act until Saif al-Islam 's father literally began to kill his own people " . According to NGO Monitor , this was despite the fact that David Held , Co-Director of LSE Global Governance , was partially influenced by Whitson 's remarks regarding her Libyan visit , referring to Saif al-Islam Gaddafi as a reformer

		ANSWER=1906 earthquake
		GOLD_MENTION=1906 earthquake
		CONTEXT=During California 's early statehood period , in the 19th and 20th century , large numbers of Irish and German immigrant workers moved into the area . Around 1900 , the Mission District was still one of San Francisco 's least densely populated areas , with most of the inhabitants being white families from the working class and lower middle class who lived in single-family houses and two-family flats . Development and settlement intensified after the 1906 earthquake , as many displaced businesses and residents moved into the area , making Mission Street a major commercial thoroughfare . In 1926 , the Polish community of San Francisco converted a church on 22nd Street and Shotwell Street and opened its doors as the Polish Club of San Francisco ; it is referred to today as the " Dom Polski " , or Polish Home . The Irish American community made its mark on the area during this time , with notable residents such as etymologist Peter Tamony calling the Mission home . During the 1940-1960s , a large number of Mexican immigrants moved into the area — displaced from an earlier " Mexican Barrio " located on Rincon Hill in order to create the western landing of the Bay Bridge — initiating white flight , giving the Mission a heavily Chicano/Latino character for which it continues to be known today . During the 1960s , Central American immigration has contributed to a Central American presence that outnumbers Mexicans since the 1960s

But unlike her MTV VMA run-down , Aguilera backs into " Genie in a Bottle " rather than opening with it . ... Opening with the ballad allowed Aguilera to flex her vocal muscles , but the zipping between songs never allowed her - or her background dancers - to catch a groove "

" With Marin County serving as the backdrop , looking " like some never-never land east of the Sun and west of the Moon , " O'Connor recognized most of the interactions as following well-established cinematic tropes , the notable ones being between Cindel " looking like one of those little blond angels used to top off Christmas trees " and Wicket , a performance by the-then 14 year-old Warwick Davis , whom O'Connor called " the cleverest of the lot . " Pointing to the main characters and plot elements , one pair of writers concluded that both '' Caravan of Courage '' and its sequel '' Battle for Endor '' are fairy tales despite occurring in a science fiction setting . They point to magical phenomena in both films , which is a fantasy element .

		ANSWER=Lockerbie bombing
		GOLD_MENTION=the Lockerbie bombing
		CONTEXT=On 4 October 2009 , Fred Halliday , Emeritus Professor of International Relations at the LSE and the School 's leading expert on the Middle East , wrote a memorandum to the LSE Council regarding the proposed cooperation with the Gaddafi Foundation . " I have repeatedly expressed reservations about formal educational and funding links with that country . " While those in favour of accepting the donation argued that " Libya is changing internally , " most informed observers agree that while some of the worst excesses for the moment have ceased , the rights of its people are badly protected . Libya " remains a country run by a secretive , erratic and corrupt elite . " Since 9/11 the Libyan government has reached compromises with the West on a number of issues , notably the Lockerbie bombing and nuclear weapons . Yet tactical changes in foreign policy are not sufficient for the purposes of evaluating political and academic links . There are also ways in which Libyan foreign policy has '' not '' changed : the country continues to call for the destruction of Israel ; Muammar Gaddafi recently called for the abolition of Switzerland , and he receives the leader of the Somali pirates operating off the Horn of Africa as honoured guests of state . Moreover , Libya 's handling of the Lockerbie bombing " has not been characterised by either consistency or clarity , " I have in the past , Halliday noted , defended accepting grants from authoritarian regimes such as the Gulf states , " but there should be clear limits on this , depending on the degree of political and human rights abuses perpetrated with them and on their ongoing foreign policy conduct . " Whitehall and the City are now happy to do business with Libya , but it does not follow that the LSE should do the same . Responsible leaders throughout the Middle East continue to express reservations regarding Libya , including " its more prominent ' liberal ' representatives . " We must remember , Halliday concluded , that the " liberal " wing within a regime such as Libya does not have the function of producing change but its role is instead " to reach compromises with internal hard-liners that serve to lessen external pressure . " A good case in point are the proposals LSE now is considering . It is , as LSE alumni in positions of responsibility in the region caution , " far too early for the School to take this step . " In 2009 , Human Rights Watch was allowed entry to Libya , via Saif al-Islam Gaddafi 's non-profit organization in order to gather facts about the human rights situation there . While HRW reported that there were concerns about the " repressive atmosphere , " they felt there were signs of " improvement " and Sarah Leah Whitson , director of HRW 's Middle East division said that one should not " underestimate the importance of the efforts made so far " by Gaddafi in the realm of human rights in Libya . She also wrote of her official visit that " the real impetus for the transformation rests squarely with a quasi-governmental organization , the Qaddafi Foundation for International Charities and Development " chaired by Gaddafi . She praised Gaddafi for establishing the country 's two semi-private newspapers , and said " it is impossible to underestimate the importance of the efforts made so far . Let 's hope this spring will last . " In January 2011 , HRW criticised other organisations as well as governments that had previously dealt with Gaddafi . HRW Business and Human Rights Director Arvind Ganesan condemned the London School of Economics ( LSE ) for allowing " abusive and corrupt officials or their families to launder their images in exchange for money " . This was later followed by Ganesen saying that " the London School of Economics did not act until Saif al-Islam 's father literally began to kill his own people " . According to NGO Monitor , this was despite the fact that David Held , Co-Director of LSE Global Governance , was partially influenced by Whitson 's remarks regarding her Libyan visit , referring to Saif al-Islam Gaddafi as a reformer

Since then the now much more ethnically-diversified group took responsibility for a series of suicide and other attacks in the Russian republics in North Caucasus and elsewhere , including the 2009 car bombing which killed at least 25 at police headquarters in Nazran , Ingushetia , a car bomb assassination attempt at the Ingush president Yunus-Bek Yevkurov , and the killing of scores of policemen in numerous smaller suicide attacks in Chechnya and Ingushetia , and since the beginning of 2010 eventually also in Dagestan .

		CONTEXT=On the night of 3 July , General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi , head of the Egyptian Armed Forces , announced in a live televised address that Mohamed Morsi had been deposed and replaced by the head of the constitutional court Adly Mansour and that the constitution had been suspended . Morsi was immediately detained and kept under house arrest at the Republican Guard headquarters in Cairo while several other government officials and Islamist figures supporting Morsi were also arrested . The move marked a turning point for the country 's future and for the fate of the Muslim Brotherhood , as it was designated a terrorist group later that year in response to a bombing in Mansoura ( even though Ansar Bait al-Maqdis claimed responsibility ) and was subjected to an unprecedented crackdown amid an ongoing Islamist unrest . A crackdown by the military on the sit-in at Rabaa al-Adawiya Square led to the August 2013 Rabaa massacre , which Human Rights Watch described as ' one of the world 's largest killings of demonstrators in a single day in recent history ' and led to the deaths of at least 817 people in Rabaa itself and 904 people across the country by the end of 14 August . Ten members of the security forces were also killed
