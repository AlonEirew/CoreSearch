QUERY_ANSWERS={'Johnstown Flood of 1977', 'massive flood', '1977 flood'}
QUERY_CONTEXT=The flood was preceded by rains from March 9 that did not stop until March 22 , 1936 . The storms brought warmer 50 °F ( 10 °C ) weather that was a cause of one stage of flooding and the continuous rains a second cause of flooding . The natural run-off of 1 to 3 inches ( 2.5 to 7.5 cm ) was far surpassed by the deluge of from 10 to 30 inches ( 25 to 75 cm ) of water in the region . The flood came before pending flood control legislation was enacted or any significant flood control measures implemented . The narrowness of the valleys and encroachment of buildings on the river banks contributed to record flooding . By the time nightfall came one-third of the city was under of water and by the time flooding was over twenty-five people lost their lives . The damages , estimated at $ 43 million , made it the worst flood since the flood of 1889 and the event is chronicled at the Johnstown Flood Museum After the flood , sweeping nationwide flood control laws were enacted and from 1938 to 1943 Johnstown saw many projects completed . These measures gave the people the feeling that the area was now " flood free " , and it was touted as such until the flood of 1977

		CONTEXT=In 1977 the Board of Governors of the World Bank approved Bura Irrigation and Settlement Project ( BISP ) in Kenya . The project area is situated just South of the Equator in the Lower Tana Basin . It lies on the west bank of the Tana River and falls within the administrative area of Tana River County . The project was an ambitious attempt of the government of Kenya , the World Bank and a few other donors to develop a remote area , create employment for thousands of people with a reasonable income and earn foreign exchange . Bura project would develop about 6,700 net irrigated ha over a 5 1/2 year period and settle on smallholdings about 5,150 landless poor families selected from all parts of Kenya . Physical and social infrastructure would be provided to support the settler and satellite population , expected to reach a total of 65,000 persons by 1985 . The total cost of the project was estimated at 92 million dollars in 1977 prices . Actual construction started in 1978 . During implementation the costs exploded from $ 17,500 / = per family to $ 55,000 / = , a new record for the World Bank . The largest cost increase was for the irrigation network ( 615 % ) . The donors were not willing and the government was not able to raise the additional funds and subsequently the size of the project was scaled down from 6,700 ha to 3,900 and later to 2,500 ha , although the irrigation structures were completed for 6,700 ha . In this period 2,100 landless households from all over Kenya were settled in the scheme . They were allocated two plots of 0.625 ha and a garden of 0.05 ha . Each year they were to grow 1.25 ha cotton and 0.625 maize intercropped with cowpeas . Soon it was evident that the project would fail to achieve its objectives . Job creation was only 40 % of the target , the economic rate of return was negative and the annual operating and maintenance costs exceeded the benefits . Even with net farm incomes of about 40 % of the appraisal estimates in real terms , annual government subsidies amounted to about 1,000 dollars per settler . The project had an unreliable water supply and many buildings had foundation problems . After cotton crop failures due to pests in 1990 the project came virtually to a standstill as the management lacked the funds to finance cotton and maize crops . Most settlers deserted and the only the ones with nowhere to go remained in the scheme , living on famine relief and odd jobs . In the period 1993 - 2005 a number of times the government tried to revive a number of timesthe project , but all in vain . After 2005 , rehabilitation and crop growing started in phases and since 2009 - 10 the tenants have been growing crops , although the cropping pattern comed down to no more than 50 % of the projected crop intensity and the settlers have low incomes , if any . This is partly caused by the fact that the original cash crop , cotton , is no longer a profitable crop .

		CONTEXT=In physics , the scallop theorem states that a swimmer that exhibits time - symmetric motion can not achieve net displacement in a low Reynolds number Newtonian fluid environment , i.e. a fluid that is highly viscous . Such a swimmer deforms its body into a particular shape through a sequence of motions and then reverts to the original shape by going through the sequence in reverse . This is known as reciprocal motion and is invariant under time - reversal . Edward Mills Purcell stated this theorem in his 1977 paper Life at Low Reynolds Number explaining physical principles of aquatic locomotion . The theorem is named for the motion of a scallop which opens and closes a simple hinge during one period . Such motion is not sufficient to create migration at low Reynolds numbers . The scallop is an example of a body with one degree of freedom to use for motion . Bodies with a single degree of freedom deform in a reciprocal manner and subsequently , bodies with one degree of freedom do not achieve locomotion in a highly viscous environment .

		CONTEXT=The nine bestowments ( ) were awards given by Chinese emperors to officials , ostensibly to reward them for their accomplishments . While the nature of the bestowments was probably established during the Zhou Dynasty , there was no record of anyone receiving them until Wang Mang . Thereafter , the nine bestowments became typically a sign of a powerful official showing off his complete control of the emperor and establishing his intent to usurp the throne . For the rest of Chinese history , it became rare for a usurpation to happen without the nine bestowments having been given sometime before , and just as rare for the nine bestowments to be given without an usurpation happening , however , an example of the latter was Cao Pi giving Sun Quan the nine bestowments in 221 when Sun was briefly Cao Wei 's vassal . Conversely , officials who made important contributions and were offered the nine bestowments would decline them to show their loyalty and lack of intention to usurp the throne .

QUERY_CONTEXT=In the 1959 review for '' Sight & Sound '' , David Vaughan calls '' Gigi '' " an elegant film " with a " cultivated visual taste which is everywhere apparent " . He summarises that " while '' Gigi '' does not represent a revival of the MGM musical in its heyday , it is a welcome extension of latter-day musical style in its adult subject-matter and its avoidance of spectacle made vulgar by emphasis on size . " He praises Minnelli 's talent for " the delicious amorality of the anecdote , but also the honesty and irony of its telling which have become foreign to the American cinema . " Vaughan points out " Chevalier 's practiced but irresistible charm as one of the film 's greatest assets " as well as " the brilliant high-comedy playing of Isabel Jeans , who as Aunt Alicia consummately portrays the distinction and beauty of a retired aristocrat of the '' demimonde '' . " Bosley Crowther of '' The New York Times '' called it " a musical film that bears such a basic resemblance to '' My Fair Lady '' that the authors may want to sue themselves " . He added , " But do n't think this point of resemblance is made in criticism of the film , for '' Gigi '' is a charming entertainment that can stand on its own two legs . It is not only a charming comprehension of the spicy confection of Colette , but it is also a lovely and lyrical enlargement upon that story 's flavored mood and atmosphere … Vincente Minnelli has marshaled a cast to give a set of performances that , for quality and harmony , are superb . " Abel Green of '' Variety '' called the film " 100 % escapist fare " and predicted it " is destined for a global box-office mop-up " . He added , " Alan Jay Lerner 's libretto is tailor-made for an inspired casting job for all principals , and Fritz Loewe 's tunes ( to Lerner 's lyrics ) already vie with and suggest their memorable '' My Fair Lady '' score … Miss Caron is completely captivating and convincing in the title role … Skillful casting , performance and presentation have endowed realism to the sum total … Director Minnelli 's good taste in keeping it in bounds and the general sound judgment of all concerned … distinguishes this Arthur Freed independent production . The Metrocolor rates recognition for its soft pastels under Joseph Ruttenberg 's lensing ; the Beaton costumes , sets and general production design are vivid physical assets at first sight . The skillful integration of words-and-music with the plot motivation makes this '' Gigi '' a very fair lady indeed as a boxoffice entry . " '' Time Out New York '' said , " The dominating creative contribution comes from Minnelli and Cecil Beaton … The combination of these two visual elitists is really too much — it 's like a meal consisting of cheesecake , and one quickly longs for something solid and vulgar to weigh things down . No doubt inspired by the finicky , claustrophobic sets and bric-à-brac , the cast tries ( with unfortunate success ) to be more French than the French , especially Chevalier . The exception is Gingold , who inhabits , as always , a world of her own . " '' TV Guide '' rated the film 3 ½ out of five stars , calling it " Overbaked but enjoyable , and a banquet for the eyes , thanks to the visual wonder of the Minnelli-Beaton teaming … Caron … leads the cast in a contest to see who can be the most French . The winner is Chevalier , in a performance that makes one feel as if you 're gagging on pastry … Perhaps if the sweetness of '' Gigi '' was contrasted with elements of honest vulgarity , the picture could balance itself out … Ten minutes into the movie , you 've resolved the plot and are left to wallow in lovely frou-frou . The film makes wonderful use of the usual Parisian landmarks , and benefits from extraordinary period costumes and sets . " '' Gigi '' won a record-breaking nine Academy Awards ( at the 1959 Oscars ceremony ) ; however , this record only lasted for one year , as '' Ben-Hur '' broke this record the following year with 11 Oscars . In tribute to '' Gigi '' s domination of the Oscars , the MGM switchboard answered calls the following day with " M-Gigi-M " . '' Gigi '' , eventually along with 1987 's '' The Last Emperor '' , held the record as the film ( s ) with the most Academy Award wins in every category in which it was nominated , until 2003 's '' The Lord of the Rings : The Return of the King '' broke the record at the 2004 Oscars ceremony with 11 Oscar nominations and 11 Oscar wins

		CONTEXT=Some media outlets received the broadcast positively . '' St. Louis Post-Dispatch '' television critic Gail Pennington praised Stewart 's performance as host writing that he " did the Oscars proud Sunday night , turning in a four-star hosting performance that unfortunately made the rest of the show seem sluggish by comparison . " Film critic Roger Ebert said that Stewart was " on target , topical and funny , " and added , " He was as relaxed , amusing and at home as Johnny Carson . " Columnist Ray Richmond of '' The Hollywood Reporter '' commented , " He seemed at times nervous and self-conscious , but on the whole , Stewart delivered with just the right balance of reverence and smugness . " Others media publications were more critical of the show . Television critic Rob Owen of the '' Pittsburgh Post-Gazette '' wrote that Stewart was more " amusing than funny " . He added , " Many of his jokes fell flat with the stars in the Kodak Theatre , and his tendency to bow down before celebrities quickly grew tiresome . " Tom Shales from '' The Washington Post '' commented , " It 's hard to believe that professional entertainers could have put together a show less entertaining than this year 's Oscars , hosted with a smug humorlessness by comic Jon Stewart , a sad and pale shadow of great hosts gone by . " Moreover , he derided the " piles and piles and miles and miles of clips from films present and past " writing that it " squandered the visual luster " of the ceremony . Associated Press television critic Frazier Moore remarked , " Stewart , usually a very funny guy , displayed a lack of beginner 's luck as first-time host ... His usually impeccable blend of puckishness and self-effacement fell flat in the service of Oscar . " He also criticized the decision to play music over the winner 's acceptance speeches calling it " distracting and obnoxious . " The American telecast on ABC drew in an average of 38.94 million people over its length , which was an 8 % decrease from the previous year 's ceremony . Additionally , the show earned lower Nielsen ratings compared to the previous ceremony with 23.0 % of households watching over a 35 share .

		CONTEXT=The show received a mixed reception from media publications . On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes , the show holds an approval rating of 43 % based on 30 critics , and summarized , " The 90th Academy Awards played it safe and hit no major snags -- but by clocking in at over four hours , returning host Jimmy Kimmel and company wore out their welcome long before the surprise ending . " Hank Stuever of '' The Washington Post '' marked , " In his second year , Kimmel has shown that the telecast need n't be anything but sharp and sure , with a funny host whose bits are manageable , shareable and – best of all – forgotten . We 're not making showbiz history here ; we 're just trying to get through another Oscar night . " Chief critic David Edelstein of '' Vulture '' wrote , " This was the best , most inspiring , and most sheerly likable Academy Awards telecast I 've ever seen . ... It was also – in terms of the actual awards – among the most disappointing . " '' Vanity Fair '' s , Richard Lawson wrote , " As a host , Kimmel struck a careful , appropriately measured tone ... All told , Sunday 's ceremony did an admirable job of recognizing all the turmoil surrounding it while maintaining the silly , chintzy trappings that so many of us tune into the Oscars for . " CNN 's Brian Lowry quipped , " The Oscars are a big , unwieldy beast , which invariably try to serve too many masters . Yet if the intent was ultimately to maintain a celebratory tone without ignoring either the outside world or the elephant in the room throughout this year 's awards , host Jimmy Kimmel and the show itself largely succeeded . " Others were more critical of the show . Television critic Maureen Ryan of '' Variety '' said , " All things considered , the show had a more or less low-key vibe . Normally it takes about two hours for the numbing effect to set in , but despite host Jimmy Kimmel 's best efforts , Sunday 's telecast started to feel a bit languid and low-energy far earlier . " Television critic James Poniewozik of '' The New York Times '' said , " despite the recent upheaval in Hollywood , the ceremony at large still focused mainly on celebration and glitter literally , in the case of the blinding set , which looked as if the ceremony were encased in an enormous geode . There 's also the perennial problem of bloat . The hitch , of course , is that every part of the show has its constituency . " Darren Franich of '' Entertainment Weekly '' wrote , " What fun we had at this year 's Oscars ! Long show , sure , but where to cut it ? " Writing for '' Deadline '' Greg Evans said , " Did the nearly four-hour running time contain any moments for the Oscar ages ? Probably not . " David Wiegand of the '' San Francisco Chronicle '' wrote , " Even the hope that the noise of clapping might keep the audience at home and in the theater awake , there was little of that for anything except the entrance of actors of advance age . " '' The Oregonian '' columnist Kristi Turnquist wrote , " Was it respectful ? Absolutely . Did it make for kind of a dull , earnest Oscars show ? Yeah , kind of . " Attaining 26.5 million U.S. viewers according to Nielsen ratings , the ceremony 's telecast had a 16-percent drop in viewership from last year 's ceremony and had the lowest U.S. viewership in Oscar history . On March 6 , after the final ratings were confirmed , President Donald Trump took to his Twitter account , saying , " Lowest rated Oscars in HISTORY . Problem is , we do n't have stars anymore – except your President ( just kidding , of course ) ! " . In response , Kimmel also tweeted , saying , " Thanks , lowest rated President in HISTORY .

Already since the early summer of 1943 , German troops had been pouring into Greece , fearing an Allied landing there ( in fact falling victims to a grand-scale Allied strategic deception operation , " Operation Barclay " ) . Soon they became involved in wide-ranging counterguerrilla operations , which they carried out with great ruthlessness , based on their experiences in Yugoslavia . In the course of these operations , mass reprisals were carried out , resulting in war crimes such as at Kommeno on August 16 , the Massacre of Kalavryta in December and the Massacre of Distomo in June 1944 . At the same time , hundreds of villages were systematically torched and almost one million people left homeless

		CONTEXT=During his assassination Tullius grabbed hold of Caesar 's toga and pulled it down from his neck , which signaled to the other conspirators that it was time to attack . According to historian Suetonius , Caesar shouted out in Latin , " Ista quidem vis est ! " ( " Why , this is violence ! " ) when his toga was ripped down from his shoulder . Another version often parroted is " What is this ? Such violence against Caesar ! " which seems to emphasise Caesar 's ego as it implies both affront and shock that anyone would ever dare to attempt to attack him . However , historian Ploutarchos , does not mention anything about Caesar having said this . He claims that Caesar cried out instead " Ῥωμαϊστί ‘ μιαρώτατε Κάσκα , τί ποιεῖς ; ’ " ( " Accursed Casca , what does thou ? " or " Casca , you villain , what are you doing ? " ) in Latin when he was grabbed by senator Casca . This exclamation , however , is not reported by Suetonius . Ploutarchos and Suetonius described that they believed that the last sound Caesar ever made was simply a groan as he was slashed by a knife the first time . Although the utterance was suggested to be more of an aggressive " spontaneous curse " than any kind of sigh

" While Davies ' predecessor , William Christian Bullitt , Jr. had been an admirer of the Soviet Union who gradually came to loathe Stalin 's brutality and repression , Davies remained unaffected by reports of the disappearance of thousands of Russians and foreigners in the Soviet Union throughout his stay as U.S. Ambassador . His reports from the Soviet Union were pragmatic , optimistic , and usually devoid of criticism of Stalin and his policies . While he briefly noted the USSR 's ' authoritarian ' form of government , Davies praised the nation 's boundless natural resources and the contentment of Soviet workers while ' building socialism ' . He went on numerous tours of the country , carefully prearranged by Soviet officials . In one of his final memos from Moscow to Washington D.C. , Davies assessed : Communism holds no serious threat to the United States . Friendly relations in the future may be of great general value . Davies attended the Trial of the Twenty One , one of the Stalinist purge trials of the late 1930s . He was convinced of the guilt of the accused . According to Davies , " the Kremlin 's fears regarding treason in the Army and Party were well justified " . His opinions were at odds with much of the Western press of the day , as well as those of his own staff , many of whom had been in the country far longer than Davies . The career diplomat Charles Bohlen , who served under Davies in Moscow , later wrote : Davies even claimed that communism was " protecting the Christian world of free men " , and he urged all Christians " by the faith you have found at your mother 's knee , in the name of the faith you have found in temples of worship " to embrace the Soviet Union

		GOLD_MENTION=Stalinist terror
		SCORE=0.36176565289497375
		CONTEXT=The crux of Nolte 's thesis was presented when he wrote : " It is a notable shortcoming of the literature about National Socialism that it does not know or does not want to admit to what degree all the deeds — with the sole exception of the technical process of gassing — that the National Socialists later committed had already been described in a voluminous literature of the early 1920s : mass deportations and shootings , torture , death camps , extermination of entire groups using strictly objective selection criteria , and public demands for the annihilation of millions of guiltless people who were thought to be " enemies " . It is probable that many of these reports were exaggerated . It is certain that the “ White Terror ” also committed terrible deeds , even though its program contained no analogy to the “ extermination of the bourgeoisie ” . Nonetheless , the following question must seem permissible , even unavoidable : Did the National Socialists or Hitler perhaps commit an “ Asiatic ” deed merely because they and their ilk considered themselves to be the potential victims of an “ Asiatic ” deed ? Was n’t the ' Gulag Archipelago ' more original than Auschwitz ? Was the Bolshevik murder of an entire class not the logical and factual '' prius '' of the " racial murder " of National Socialism ? Can not Hitler 's most secret deeds be explained by the fact that he had '' not '' forgotten the rat cage ? Did Auschwitz in its root causes not originate in a past that would not pass ? " Nolte wrote the principle problem " for the coming generations ... must be liberation from collectivist thinking " , which Nolte claimed dominated scholarship on Nazi Germany . Nolte ended his essay with calling for a " more comprehensive debate " about the memory of Nazi Germany that would allow for " the past that will not go away " to finally go away " as is suitable for every past " . Nolte subsequently presented a 1940 book by American author Theodore N. Kaufman entitled '' Germany Must Perish ! '' . The text contends that all German men should be sterilized , evidencing , according to Nolte , the alleged " Jewish " desire to " annihilate " Germans prior to the Holocaust . An August 1941 appeal to the world by a group of Soviet Jews seeking support against Germany was also cited by Nolte as evidence of Jewish determination to thwart the '' Reich '' . Nolte argued that the Nazis felt forced to undertake the Holocaust by Hitler 's conclusion that the entire Jewish population of the world had declared war on Germany . From Nolte 's point of view , the Holocaust was an act of “ Asiatic barbarism ” forced on the Germans by the fear of what Joseph Stalin , whom Nolte believed to have significant Jewish support , might do to them . Nolte contends that the U.S. internment of Japanese Americans in the wake of the Pearl Harbor attack provides a parallel to the German " internment " of the Jewish population of Europe in concentration camps , in light of what Nolte alleges was the " Jewish " declaration of war on Germany in 1939 which Weizmann 's letter allegedly constitutes . Subsequently , Nolte expanded upon these views in his 1987 book '' Der europäische Bürgerkrieg , 1917 – 1945 '' ( '' The European Civil War , 1917 – 1945 '' ) in which he claimed that the entire 20th century was an age of genocide , totalitarianism , and tyranny , and that the Holocaust had been merely one chapter in the age of violence , terror and population displacement . Nolte claimed that this age had started with the genocide of the Armenians during World War I , and also included the Stalinist terror in the Soviet Union , the expulsion of ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe , Maoist terror in China as manifested in such events as the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution , compulsory population exchanges between Greece and Turkey from 1922 to 1923 , American war crimes in the Vietnam War , the Khmer Rouge genocide in Cambodia , and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan . In particular , Nolte argued that the expulsion of ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe in 1945 – 46 was " to be categorized ... under the concept of genocide " . As part of this argument , Nolte cited the 1979 book of the American historian Alfred-Maurice de Zayas , '' Die Wehrmacht Untersuchungsstelle '' , which argues that the Allies were just as guilty of war crimes as the Germans as the " happy evidence of the will to objectivity on the part of a foreigner " In Nolte 's opinion , Hitler was a " European citizen " who fought in defence of the values of the West against " Asiatic " Bolshevism , but due to his " total egocentrism " waged this struggle with unnecessary violence and brutality Since in Nolte 's view , the '' Shoah '' was not a unique crime , there is no reason to single out Germans for special criticism for the Holocaust . In addition , Nolte sees his work as the beginning of a much-needed revisionist treatment to end the " negative myth " of the Third Reich that dominates contemporary perceptions . Nolte took the view that the principle problem of German history was this “ negative myth ” of the Third Reich , which cast the Nazi era as the '' ne plus ultra '' of evil . Nolte wrote that after the American Civil War , the defeated South was cast as the symbol of total evil by the victorious North , but later “ revisionism ” became the dominant historical interpretation against the “ negative myth ” of the South , which led to a more balanced history of the Civil War with a greater understanding of the “ motives and way of life of the defeated Southern states ” , and led to the leaders of the Confederacy becoming great American heroes . Nolte urged that a similar “ revisionism ” destroy the “ negative myth ” of the Third Reich . Nolte argued that the Vietnam War , the Khmer Rouge genocide , the expulsion of " boat people " from Vietnam , the Islamic revolution in Iran , and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan meant the traditional picture of Nazi Germany as the ultimate in evil was no longer tenable , and proved the need for " revisionism " to put an end to the " negative myth " of the Third Reich . In Nolte 's view , the first efforts at revisionism of the Nazi period failed because A. J. P. Taylor 's 1961 book '' The Origins of the Second World War '' was only a part of the " anti-German literature of indictment " while David Hoggan in '' Der erzwugnene Krieg '' , by only seeking to examine why World War II broke out in 1939 , " cut himself off from the really decisive questions " . Then the next revisionist efforts Nolte cites were the Italian historian Domenico Settembrini 's favorable treatment of Fascism for saving Italy from Communism , and the British historian Timothy Mason 's studies in working class German history . The best of the revisionists according to Nolte is David Irving , with whom Nolte finds some fault , although " not all of Irving 's theses and points can be dismissed with such ease " . Nolte praises Irving as the first to understand that Weizmann 's letter to Chamberlain was a " Jewish declaration of war " on Germany that justified the " interning " of the Jews of Europe . Nolte went on to praise Irving for putting the Holocaust " in a more comprehensive perspective " by comparing it to the British fire-bombing of Hamburg in 1943 , which Nolte views as just much of an act of genocide as the " Final Solution " . The sort of revisionism needed to end the " negative myth " of the Third Reich is , in Nolte 's opinion , an examination of the impact of the Russian Revolution on Germany

QUERY_CONTEXT=In May 1943 the division transferred for garrison duties to the Greek island of Cefalonia . After Italy 's surrender to the Allies on 3 September 1943 the divisions commanding general Antonio Gandin was left without clear orders from his superiors . Therefore , Gandin decided to let his soldiers vote on 13 September 1943 as to what to do to next . The troops voted overwhelmingly to fight their former allies the Germans , thus the '' Acqui '' became one of the very few Italian units to actively resist the Germans . The Germans therefore summarily executed over half of the divisions soldiers and all of its officers in revenge during the Massacre of the Acqui Division

		CONTEXT=Oplontis is an ancient Roman archaeological site located in the middle of the city of Torre Annunziata , which is south of Naples in the Campania region of southern Italy . . The name " Oplontis " most likely referred originally to the baths in the area of Campo Oncino . The site comprises two Roman villas , the best-known of which is the so-called Villa Poppaea . Like the nearby towns of Pompeii and Herculaneum , Oplontis was buried in ash and lava during the volcanic eruption of Mount Vesuvius in A.D. 79 . The first villa , referred to by archaeologists as Villa A , was rediscovered in 1590 during the construction of a canal , but no attempt was made to explore the ruins . In 1839 – 40 , archaeological excavations were begun , but ceased due to lack of funds . It was only in 1964 – 84 that a full-scale excavation was performed that revealed about 60 % of the villa , including a large swimming pool and private baths . The parts of the villa lying under modern structures remain unexcavated . A pottery sherd bearing the name of freedman of Poppaea Sabina , the second wife of Nero was found at the site , which suggests the villa may have been the Empress ’ residence when she was away from Rome . Badly damaged in the A.D. 62 Pompeii earthquake , Villa A was probably uninhabited and in the process of being rebuilt ( a number of tools were found on the site ) at the time of the A.D. 79 eruption . Villa A is famous for its Second - and Third-Style wall paintings . The former are found in the oldest part of the building , which date from c. 50 B.C. , while the latter were created when the villa was rebuilt after the earthquake

		CONTEXT=During the summer of 1944 , the head of the local resistance organization , Napoleon Zervas , asked the Cham Albanians to join EDES in its fight against the left-wing ELAS , but their response was negative . After that and in accordance to orders given specifically to EDES by the Allied forces to push them out of the area , fierce fighting occurred between the two sides . According to British reports , the Cham collaborationist bands managed to flee to Albania with all of their equipment , together with half million stolen cattle as well as 3,000 horses , leaving only the elderly members of the community behind . On 18 June 1944 , EDES forces with Allied support launched an attack on Paramythia . After short-term conflict against a combined Cham-German garrison , the town was finally under Allied command . Soon after , violent reprisals were carried out against the town 's Muslim community , which was considered responsible for the massacre of September 1943

QUERY_CONTEXT=Farsa ( ) is a village on the island of Kefalonia , Greece , part of the municipal unit of Argostoli . It is situated on the eastern shore of the Gulf of Argostoli . Farsa is 2 km northwest of Davgata , 4 km northeast of Lixouri ( across the gulf ) and 6 km north of Argostoli . Records exist in the Venetian archives for this village since the early Venetian period ( 16th century ) . During World War II many Italian soldiers were posted there and it was one of the places that the Massacre of the Acqui Division took place . The 1953 Ionian earthquake damaged many buildings in the old village of Farsa but did not totally destroy it . The remains of the old village are visible today . Dr. Nicholas Zaferatos , an environmental studies professor in the Huxley College at Western Washington University has made a study with his students on the renovation of the old village . The entire population that time as well as other parts of the island were homeless and part of the population left Farsa

		CONTEXT=Perhaps the best known appearance of Cephalonia in popular culture is in the novel '' Captain Corelli 's Mandolin '' , by the English author Louis de Bernières . The book is believed to have been inspired by the village of Farsa , just outside Argostoli . The love story comprising the theme of the book is set before and after the Acqui Division massacre , during the Second World War . A film adaptation was released in 2001 . During filming there was lively debate between the production team , local authorities as well as groups of citizens , as to the complex historical details of the island 's antifascist resistance . As a result , political references were omitted from the film , and the romantic core of the book was preserved , without entering complex debates about the island 's history . In 2005 , Riccardo Milani made his TV movie , '' Cefalonia '' , also about the massacre , with music by Ennio Morricone

		CONTEXT=In the first years of the First Intifada ( 1987 – 1993 ) , Hamas violence was directed first at collaborators with Israel and at individuals it considered moral deviants , and then later at the Israeli military . A new direction began with the formation of the al-Qassam Brigades militia in 1992 , and in 1993 suicide attacks began against Israeli targets on the West Bank .

		CONTEXT=Kaputikyan was increasingly critical of the government of independent Armenia 's second president , Robert Kocharyan . On 14 April 2004 , she wrote an open letter titled " Kocharyan Must Go " ( « Քոչարյանը պետք է հեռանա » ) , where she called for his resignation and protested the violent crackdown on an opposition demonstration on 12/13 April , which left dozens injured . She also returned the Mesrop Mashtots Medal she had been awarded by Kocharyan in 1999 . Regarding the beating of the opposition politician Ashot Manucharyan , Kaputikyan stated : " Beating in Armenia has become the basic means of politics and the most influential part of state terror . All cases when force has been used should be viewed from this standpoint . " ArmeniaNow reported that she thus became " an opposition celebrity " . She also wrote that a responsible politician would have resigned after the 1999 shooting in the Armenian parliament when Prime Minister Vazgen Sargsyan and Parliament Speaker Karen Demirchyan were assassinated , among others . In response , Kocharyan stated that the Mesrop Mashtots Medal is not his medal , but that of the Republic of Armenia . He added that he regrets that is how Kaputikyan 's views the " essence of our state " and does not contribute to " our nation 's respect for education of the young generation . " Kaputikyan is among the most notable Armenian women in history . She became a classic of Armenian literature during her lifetime and her poems have been included in school literature programs . Kaputikyan is often referred to in Armenian circles as Ամենայն հայոց բանաստեղծուհի , which literally translates to " Poetess of All Armenians " and imitates the " Poet of All Armenians " title given to Hovhannes Tumanyan , which itself derives from the Catholicos of All Armenians , the head of the Armenian Church . She was " one of the best-known and widely quoted Soviet Armenian poets " . An Armenian government press release on her death described Kaputikyan as " one of the most outstanding Armenian poets of the 20th century " . '' Aravot '' reported in 2004 that she is the " last of her kind . " In 1989 journalist and political analyst Bohdan Nahaylo described Kaputikyan as one of the " highly respected non-Russian cultural figures " of the Soviet Union

There has been no strong argument that al-Qaeda was involved , although there have been allegations , including by a former Director of Central Intelligence , that Iraq supported the operational cell . In a PBS interview in October 2001 , former Clinton-era CIA Director James Woolsey argued a supposed link between Ramzi Youssef and the Iraqi intelligence services . He suggested the grand jury investigation turned up evidence pointing to Iraq that the Clinton Justice Department " brushed aside . " Neil Herman , who headed the FBI investigation , noted that despite Yasin 's presence in Baghdad , there was no evidence of Iraqi support for the attack . " We looked at that rather extensively , " he told CNN terrorism analyst Peter L. Bergen . " There were no ties to the Iraqi government . " Bergen writes , " In sum , by the mid - '90s , the Joint Terrorism Task Force in New York , the F.B.I. , the U.S. Attorney 's office in the Southern District of New York , the C.I.A. , the N.S.C. , and the State Department had all found no evidence implicating the Iraqi government in the first Trade Center attack . " Claims that Saddam Hussein was behind the bombing are based on the research of Laurie Mylroie of the conservative American Enterprise Institute

		CONTEXT=, the film holds a rating of 75 % on Rotten Tomatoes based on 28 reviews , with an average rating of 6.47 / 10 . The website 's critical consensus reads : " Abel Ferrara 's 1995 horror/suspense experiment blends urban vampire adventure with philosophical analysis to create a smart , idiosyncratic and undeniably odd take on the genre . " Kevin Thomas of the '' Los Angeles Times '' praised Taylor 's performance , and added : " Although Ferrara dares to be intellectual in a manner virtually unique in commercial American cinema , he nevertheless does n't forget how to entertain in the gory , bravura manner associated with him . Although it undeniably helps , you do n't have to know your Heidegger from Hamburger Helper to enjoy '' The Addiction '' as a grisly yet unusual thriller of the supernatural . " '' The Washington Post '' s Hal Hinson was less laudatory of Taylor 's performance , writing that she " seems less distinctive here than she has been in past roles . " However , he praised Walken 's performance , though summarized the film as " serious and passionate ; Ferrara 's conviction , too , is unquestionable . However , when he flashes images of historic atrocities of both the distant and recent past — Nazi death camps , the war dead in Bosnia — his ideas come across as shallow and banal . Also , inserting scenes of real-life horror into what is essentially a glorified genre exercise may strike some as the essence of bad taste . " Caryn James of '' The New York Times '' expressed a similar sentiment , noting " When the film connects Kathleen 's struggle to resist evil to My Lai and the Holocaust , those comparisons are exploitative in a way that even a genre-bending film ca n't get away with . " Stephen Hunter of '' The Baltimore Sun '' praised Taylor for portraying Kathleen " with dour , sexless intensity , " and deemed the film " far sexier than '' Interview with the Vampire '' and far deadlier than the campy '' Nadja '' ... It 's extremely disturbing , a graduate - level movie for advanced students in either of three subjects : cinema , philosophy and debauchery . " The film was nominated for the Golden Bear award at the 45th Berlin International Film Festival where it won the Blue Angel Award . Lili Taylor won the Sant Jordi Award for Best Foreign Actress . The film received Best Actress ( Taylor ) , Best Film ( Abel Ferrara ) and Special Mention Award ( Walken ) at the Málaga International Week of Fantastic Cinema .

		CONTEXT=Kim next took on his most ambitious project to date with '' Mr. Go '' , which had a ( ) budget ( one of the largest budgets in Korean cinema history ) , with funded by China-based Huayi Brothers . Based on Huh Young-man 's 1984 manhwa '' The 7th Team '' , the film centers on a 15-year-old girl ( played by Xu Jiao ) who tries to save her grandfather 's circus after the 2008 Sichuan earthquake by becoming the sports agent of a baseball-playing gorilla named Ling Ling ( inspired by Christian the lion ) . '' Mr. Go '' was filmed in stereoscopic 3D , and Kim founded a new visual effects company Dexter Studios to develop and innovate motion capture and facial motion capture techniques , and a digital fur production program to make the gorilla as realistic as possible ; a team of more than 500 animators and CG professionals spent four years on the production and over a year editing .

		CONTEXT=From 1831 to 1841 , Palestine was under the rule of the Muhammad Ali Dynasty of Egypt . During this period , the town suffered an earthquake as well as the destruction of the Muslim quarter in 1834 by Egyptian troops , apparently as a reprisal for the murder of a favored loyalist of Ibrahim Pasha . In 1841 , Bethlehem came under Ottoman rule once again and remained so until the end of World War I. Under the Ottomans , Bethlehem 's inhabitants faced unemployment , compulsory military service , and heavy taxes , resulting in mass emigration , particularly to South America . An American missionary in the 1850s reported a population of under 4,000 , nearly all of whom belonged to the Greek Church . He also noted that a lack of water crippled the town 's growth

		CONTEXT=The Temple of Bacchus — once wrongly credited to Jupiter — may have been completed under Septimius Severus in the 190s , as his coins are the first to show it beside the Temple of Jupiter . It is the best preserved of the sanctuary 's structures , as the other rubble from its ruins protected it . It is enriched by some of the most refined reliefs and sculpture to survive from antiquity . The temple is surrounded by forty-two columns — 8 along each end and 15 along each side — nearly in height . These were probably erected in a rough state and then rounded , polished , and decorated in position . The entrance was preserved as late as Pococke and Wood , but the keystone of the lintel had slid following the 1759 earthquakes ; a column of rough masonry was erected in the 1860s or '70s to support it . The 1759 earthquakes also damaged the area around the soffit 's famed inscription of an eagle , which was entirely covered by the keystone 's supporting column.The area around the inscription of the eagle was greatly damaged by the 1759 earthquake . The interior of the temple is divided into a nave and a adytum or sanctuary on a platform raised above it and fronted by 13 steps . The screen between the two sections once held reliefs of Neptune , Triton , Arion and his dolphin , and other marine figures but these have been lost . The temple was used as a kind of donjon for the medieval Arab and Turkish fortifications , although its eastern steps were lost sometime after 1688 . Much of the portico was incorporated into a huge wall directly before its gate , but this was demolished in July 1870 by Barker on orders from Syria 's governor Rashid Pasha . Two spiral staircases in columns on either side of the entrance lead to the roof

		CONTEXT=Mock Spanish is a condemning term used to describe a variety of Spanish - inspired phrases common in some otherwise monolingual circles . Most people feel that this type of language is harmless and is a natural consequence of multiculturalism . Often , Mock Spanish - inspired phrases are used in a humorous way that could advert to unfavorable and stereotypical views of Spanish speakers . The term " mock Spanish " has been popularized by anthropologist - linguist Jane H. Hill of the University of Arizona , most recognizably in relation to the catchphrase , " Hasta la vista , baby " , from the film , Terminator 2 : Judgment Day . Hill argues that the incorporation of pseudo-Spanish terms like " hasty banana " ( for hasta mañana ) , " buenos nachos " ( for buenas noches ) , " el cheapo " , " no problemo " , " hasta la bye - bye " , and other humorous uses , to some people , constitute a type of covert racism . It is also seen as a manifestation of linguistic racism .

		CONTEXT=As the title says , only rock and heavy metal videos are played in this program block . The program was widely criticized by the pentecostal movements of Finland in its early days for allegedly promoting Satanist attitudes , even though the program has never contained any Satanist music at all . The whole channel was even boycotted for a time by all kinds of Christian denominations due to " glorifying secularism and sacrilegious attitudes and spoiling the lives of young , innocent children and the youth of Finland " and the boycott was backed with the classic claims of backmasking having revealed hidden messages . At the time it was a widely believed stereotype that all metal and rock music was of the Satanist attitude , though these beliefs were mostly broken after the Eurovision Song Contest victory of Finnish heavy metal band Lordi in 2006 , which made metal music mainstream

In previous years , countries that received a top 10 placing were automatically granted a spot in the next year 's final without having to compete in a semi-final , but for 2008 , the EBU changed the automatic qualification regulations so that all countries except the " Big 4 " ( France , Germany , Spain , and the United Kingdom ) and host country , would have to pass through one of two semi-finals . The EBU split up countries with a friendly voting history into separate semi-finals , to give a better chance for other countries to win . Greece and Cyprus had often been accused of favoring each other , with each awarding the other the maximum number of points ( twelve ) at the previous contest . On January 28 , 2008 , the EBU held a special draw which determined that Greece would be in '' Semi-final 1 '' held on May 20 , 2008 in Belgrade , Serbia ; Cyprus was subsequently placed in the second semi-final

In previous years , countries that received a top 10 placing were automatically granted a spot in the next year 's final without having to compete in a semi-final , but for 2008 , the EBU changed the automatic qualification regulations so that all countries except the " Big 4 " ( France , Germany , Spain , and the United Kingdom ) and host country , would have to pass through one of two semi-finals . The EBU split up countries with a friendly voting history into separate semi-finals , to give a better chance for other countries to win . Greece and Cyprus had often been accused of favoring each other , with each awarding the other the maximum number of points ( twelve ) at the previous contest . On January 28 , 2008 , the EBU held a special draw which determined that Greece would be in '' Semi-final 1 '' held on May 20 , 2008 in Belgrade , Serbia ; Cyprus was subsequently placed in the second semi-final

		CONTEXT=Although Greece had been granted a spot in the 2008 final because of its seventh-place finish at the Eurovision Song Contest 2007 , it had to compete in a semi-final for the first time since 2004 because of new rules put into effect by the European Broadcasting Union ( EBU ) . In previous years , countries that received a top 10 placing were automatically granted a spot in the next year 's final without having to compete in a semi-final , but for 2008 , the EBU changed the automatic qualification regulations so that all countries except the " Big 4 " ( France , Germany , Spain , and the United Kingdom ) and host country , would have to pass through one of two semi-finals . The EBU split up countries with a friendly voting history into separate semi-finals , to give a better chance for other countries to win . Greece and Cyprus had often been accused of favoring each other , with each awarding the other the maximum number of points ( twelve ) at the previous contest . On January 28 , 2008 , the EBU held a special draw which determined that Greece would be in '' Semi-final 1 '' held on May 20 , 2008 in Belgrade , Serbia ; Cyprus was subsequently placed in the second semi-final

		CONTEXT=" Motivation " is a R&B slow jam song written by Richard Butler ( Rico Love ) , Jim Jonsin , Dwayne Carter and Danny Morris . The racy lyrics center around Rowland asking her man to use his hands all over her body , and are accompanied by a " synth-saturated beat " produced by Jonsin . In terms of instruments , " Motivation " uses sparse keyboard notes , programmed beats and pulsing synths in the chorus . Wayne adds a rap verse complementing Rowland 's seductive suggestions , using the kitchen and a car as metaphors for sex . According to Scott Shetler from AOL Music , Rowland uses the lyrics to promise " to be her lover 's motivation . " Rowland called the record a mixture between dance and mash-up . When asked by MTV what Rowland thought of the song , she said , " It has that personality and characteristic to it that I do n't think anybody can deny . That 's why when Wayne dropped that insane verse on there ... I was like , ' You really brought that up even more . ' He went into the studio and just did it . I do n't think it takes much for Wayne to think . He just does it . He 's so admirable . " Ryan Brockington , from the '' New York Post , '' was amongst the first to review " Motivation . " In his review , he said " The single is a big leap from the dance club synth pop that Kelly has been releasing the past year and it seems like she might be trying to shimmy her way back into the hip-hop world by teaming up with the Midas touch vocals of Lil Wayne . " Both '' Rap-Up '' and AOL Music 's Scott Shetler called the song " sexy . " Becky Bain from Idolator disliked the song for not being memorable . The short review was summed up with the closing phrase , " she ’s going to need another hit to help promote her album when it finally is ready to drop . " Wesley Case from '' The Baltimore Sun '' complemented the song 's sexy quality . " If this is n't the year 's hands-down sexiest song thus far , it has to be in the discussion . Rowland , whose sultry voice could get a priest hot , weaving in and out of the minimal beat , and setting the table for Lil Wayne 's stuttering , after-hours guest-verse . Stack the pieces together and it 's an understated knockout that gets sexier with each spin . " Billboard ranked it number five on their " Critics ' Picks : 20 Best Songs of 2011 " " Motivation " was nominated for two awards at the 2011 Soul Train Music Awards including Best Dance Performance and Song of the Year.It won the award for Song of the Year and was also nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration at the 54th Grammy Awards , which was held on February 12 , 2012

QUERY_CONTEXT=Duane Allman created the idea of having two lead guitarists , which was inspired by Curtis Mayfield ; " he wanted the bass , keyboards , and second guitar to form patterns behind the solo rather than just comping , " said Allman . Their style and incorporation of guitar harmonies was very influential on later musicians . " The pair also had a wide range of complementary techniques , often forming intricate , interlocking patterns with each other and with the bassist , Berry Oakley , setting the stage for dramatic flights of improvised melodies . " Dickey Betts ' playing was very melody-based ; " My style is just a little too smooth and round to play the blues stuff straight , because I 'm such a melody guy that even when I 'm playing the blues , I go for melody first , " he said . His listening of country and string bluegrass growing up influenced this considerably : " I played mandolin , ukulele , and fiddle before I ever touched a guitar , which may be where a lot of the major keys I play come from . " He later characterized their style as " question and answer , anticipation and conclusion , " which involved allowing each musician 's downbeat to arrive in a different spot , while also keeping consideration of the bass guitar lines . The group also held an improvisational approach to live performances , which connected the band with jam band culture . " Jazz and blues musicians have been doing this for decades , but I think they really brought that sense that anyone onstage can inspire anyone else at any given time to rock music , " said Haynes . " We sure did n't set out to be a " jam band " but those long jams just emanated from within the band , because we did n't want to just play three minutes and be over , " said Allman . '' Rolling Stone '' referred to the group as " without question the first great jam band , and they took the jam to heights that it had not previously reached . " The Allman Brothers Band were considerably influential within the Southern United States . Their arrival on the musical scene paved the way for several other notable Southern rock bands — among those Lynyrd Skynyrd , the Marshall Tucker Band and Wet Willie — to achieve commercial success , and also " almost single-handedly " made Capricorn Records into " a major independent label . " Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top , writing for '' Rolling Stone '' , wrote that the group " defined the best of every music from the American South in that time . They were the best of all of us . " He went on to call the band " a true brotherhood of players — one that went beyond race and ego . It was a thing of beauty . " The band 's extended popularity through heavy touring in the early 1990s created a new generation of fans , one that viewed the Allmans as pioneers of " latter-day collegiate jam rock . " AllMusic praised the band 's history : " they went from being America 's single most influential band to a shell of their former self trading on past glories , to reach the 21st century resurrected as one of the most respected rock acts of their era . " In 2012 , an official historic marker was erected on the site of the July 1970 Second Atlanta International Pop Festival near Byron , Georgia . The Allman Brothers Band had played two sets at the festival , which was a significant event in their career . The marker text reads , in part : " Over thirty musical acts performed , including ... Macon 's Allman Brothers Band on their launching pad to national fame . " Official sponsors of the marker included the Georgia Allman Brothers Band Association , The Allman Brothers Band Museum at the Big House , and '' Hittin ' the Note '' . In 2003 , the band released a recording of their festival opening and closing performances , '' Live at the Atlanta International Pop Festival : July 3 & 5 , 1970 ''

		CONTEXT=" Motivation " is a R&B slow jam song written by Richard Butler ( Rico Love ) , Jim Jonsin , Dwayne Carter and Danny Morris . The racy lyrics center around Rowland asking her man to use his hands all over her body , and are accompanied by a " synth-saturated beat " produced by Jonsin . In terms of instruments , " Motivation " uses sparse keyboard notes , programmed beats and pulsing synths in the chorus . Wayne adds a rap verse complementing Rowland 's seductive suggestions , using the kitchen and a car as metaphors for sex . According to Scott Shetler from AOL Music , Rowland uses the lyrics to promise " to be her lover 's motivation . " Rowland called the record a mixture between dance and mash-up . When asked by MTV what Rowland thought of the song , she said , " It has that personality and characteristic to it that I do n't think anybody can deny . That 's why when Wayne dropped that insane verse on there ... I was like , ' You really brought that up even more . ' He went into the studio and just did it . I do n't think it takes much for Wayne to think . He just does it . He 's so admirable . " Ryan Brockington , from the '' New York Post , '' was amongst the first to review " Motivation . " In his review , he said " The single is a big leap from the dance club synth pop that Kelly has been releasing the past year and it seems like she might be trying to shimmy her way back into the hip-hop world by teaming up with the Midas touch vocals of Lil Wayne . " Both '' Rap-Up '' and AOL Music 's Scott Shetler called the song " sexy . " Becky Bain from Idolator disliked the song for not being memorable . The short review was summed up with the closing phrase , " she ’s going to need another hit to help promote her album when it finally is ready to drop . " Wesley Case from '' The Baltimore Sun '' complemented the song 's sexy quality . " If this is n't the year 's hands-down sexiest song thus far , it has to be in the discussion . Rowland , whose sultry voice could get a priest hot , weaving in and out of the minimal beat , and setting the table for Lil Wayne 's stuttering , after-hours guest-verse . Stack the pieces together and it 's an understated knockout that gets sexier with each spin .

		CONTEXT=Urca is a traditional and wealthy residential neighborhood with nearly 7,000 inhabitants ( 2000 census ) in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil . Although most of the neighborhood dates from the 1920s , parts of it are much older . What is now called the Forte São João , a military base at the foot of the Sugarloaf Mountain , is where the first Portuguese settlement in Rio was founded by Estácio de Sá on March 1 , 1565 . The French had arrived 12 years earlier and founded a settlement , called France Antarctique , close to what is now Flamengo and Gloria districts , in downtown Rio . The French , riven by internal disputes between Catholics and Protestants , were massacred by the Portuguese and their Indian allies in attacks organised from here , expelling them from the nearby Villegagnon Island ( named after the French commander Nicolas Durand de Villegaignon ) . The street now called Rua São Sebastião , in Urca , which leads from behind the fort to the Urca casino , was originally a trail from the Portuguese fort skirting the edge of the sea to the mainland along the peninsula that houses the Sugar Loaf and a smaller hill , the Morro da Urca . Rua São Sebastião thus has some claim to be the oldest street in Rio .

		SCORE=8.867669066603412e-06
		CONTEXT=Shortly after the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948 , the Cicurel store in downtown Cairo was damaged in the 1948 Cairo bombings , likely the work of the Muslim Brotherhood . A memorandum submitted to the Ministry of Commerce in 1948 described the Cicurel firm as " one of the pillars of our economic independence . " The damage was repaired and the stores reopened . Neglecting the signs of changing times , the Cicurels remained in Egypt as tension against the Jews continued to mount . On January 26 , 1952 , during the Cairo Fire , an enraged mob burned and looted , unabated , large parts of modern Cairo . The Cicurel store was targeted due to the perceived European character of the store and its largely Jewish staff . After being burnt down , the store was rebuilt . The Cicurels ' situation , as well as that of most Egyptian Jews , deteriorated in 1956 during the Suez Crisis and war . This time Les Grands Magasins Cicurel was placed under governmental control , along with all other Jewish businesses . The family was forced to sell its majority holding for a pittance to a new group headed by Muslim Egyptians . The store was nationalized in 1961 . Today , the old department stores continue to operate bearing their original name , but little else resembles the original stores . The spaces are “ dismantled and rented out by the meter to wholesalers to display low-priced merchandise and electric appliances . ” By the end of 1956 , when Les Grands Magasins Cicurel was placed under government control , the majority of the family had left Egypt . Only René , Joseph 's second son , remained in Cairo in a futile attempt to liberate some family assets . However , he gave up on that impossible task in 1959 and left for Switzerland first , then in 1962 for Paris , France . The rest of the family born in Egypt dispersed across Europe and South America : Clément ( 1918-1978 ) , moved to Italy , where he worked with the department stores La Rinascente and Marks & Spencer . The children of Clément , Joseph Alain ( 1945-2011 ) and Marianne ( 1940 - ) settled in Paris ( France ) . René ( 1916-2005 ) also settled in France and his son Paul Joseph ( 1945 - ) moved to Canada and then the United States , where he built a successful career in finance . Guy ( 1917-1980 ) , moved to São Paulo , Brazil , where he leased office buildings and remained for the rest of his life . Guy 's daughters Claude and Mona remain in Brazil . Sylvain ( 1920-1991 ) , moved to Lausanne , Switzerland , where he lived the rest of his life . Salvator 's son , Ronald Moreno , remained in Switzerland after his father 's death . His daughter Janine emigrated to Argentina where she became the Argentine champion of Dressage in 1989 and 1990 and also represented Argentina at the Pan American Games in 1991

Not any more than you would hold a hammer company responsible if somebody beats somebody over the head with a hammer . " Sanders has said , " we have millions of people who are gun owners in this country -- 99.9 % of those people obey the law . I want to see real , serious debate and action on guns , but it is not going to take place if we simply have extreme positions on both sides . I think I can bring us to the middle .

QUERY_ANSWERS={'Caltavuturo massacre'}
QUERY_CONTEXT=According to many scholars , the name and origin of the town are traced back to the period of Arab rule . According to Ibn al-Athir ( '' The Complete History '' , VII .370.5 – 7 ) , in AH 268 ( 881/82 CE ) , the Aghlabid commander Abū Ṯawr was defeated by the Byzantines ( probably commanded by the '' strategos '' Mosilikes ) and his was army annihilated , with only seven men surviving . The locality was later named in Arabic '' Qalʿat Abī Ṯawr '' ( " Castle of Abū Ṯawr " ) , which is the origin of the modern name . Others instead maintain that the name derives from the Arabic word " qal ' at " ( fortress ) and the Sicilian " vuturu " ( vulture ) meaning of " fortress of vultures . " The town existed under Byzantine rule pre Arab conquest as Aziz Ahmad in “ A Islamic History of Sicily ” ( edinburgh university press 1975 ) states that in 852 Abbas raided Caltavuturo in the northern part of the Island and took many prisoners who were sold as slaves , The town was the site of the so-called Caltavuturo massacre on 20 January 1893 , when local authorities killed 13 and wounded 21 peasants that had occupied communal land that they claimed was theirs

Soon they became involved in wide-ranging counterguerrilla operations , which they carried out with great ruthlessness , based on their experiences in Yugoslavia . In the course of these operations , mass reprisals were carried out , resulting in war crimes such as at Kommeno on August 16 , the Massacre of Kalavryta in December and the Massacre of Distomo in June 1944 . At the same time , hundreds of villages were systematically torched and almost one million people left homeless

		CONTEXT=Pagae or Pagai ( ; ) , or Pegae or Pegai ( ) was a town of ancient Megaris , on the Alcyonian or Corinthian Gulf . According to some sources of greek mythology Pagae had been the home town of Tereus . It was the harbour of Megaris on the western coast , and was the most important place in the country next to the capital . According to Strabo it was situated on the narrowest part of the Megaric isthmus , the distance from Pagae to Nisaea being 120 stadia . When the Megarians joined Athens in 455 BCE , the Athenians garrisoned Pagae , and its harbour was of service to them in sending out an expedition against the northern coast of Peloponnesus . The Athenians retained possession of Pagae a short time after Megara revolted from them in 454 BCE ; but , by the thirty years ' truce made in the same year , they surrendered the place to the Megarians . At one period of the Peloponnesian War ( 424 BCE ) we find Pagae held by the aristocratical exiles from Megara . Pagae continued to exist till a late period , and under the Roman emperors was a place of sufficient importance to coin its own money . Strabo calls it τὸ τῶν Μεγαρέων φρούριον . Pausanias visited in the 2nd century and saw there a chapel of the hero Aegialeus , who fell at Glisas in the second expedition of the Argives against Thebes , but who was buried at this place . He also saw near the road to Pagae , a rock covered with marks of arrows , which were supposed to have been made by a body of the Persian cavalry of Mardonius , who in the night had discharged their arrows at the rock under the impulse of Artemis , mistaking it for the enemy . In commemoration of this event , there was a brazen statue of Artemis Soteira at Pagae . From 193 BCE Pagae was a member of the Achaean League . Pagae is also mentioned in other ancient sources , including Ptolemy , Stephanus of Byzantium , Pomponius Mela , Pliny the Elder , [ 10 ] Hierocles , [ 11 ] and the Tabula Peutingeriana , where it is called Pache .

		CONTEXT='' The Amazing Race '' won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Reality-Competition Program for the first seven years after the creation of the award in 2003 , and ten of the twelve years since its creation , against other , more popular reality TV shows such as '' Survivor '' , '' Dancing with the Stars '' , and '' American Idol '' . Its streak was ended in 2010 when '' Top Chef '' won the Emmy for this category . Host Phil Keoghan revealed in an interview that the show 's loss that year made him and the producers realize that they will have to try harder to win the Emmy again . In 2011 , the show won in the category again for the eighth time . After its seventh consecutive win , some in the media , including '' Survivor '' host Jeff Probst suggested that '' The Amazing Race '' willingly drop out from the competition in future years , similar to Candice Bergen declining any further nominations after her fifth Emmy win for her role in '' Murphy Brown '' . Van Munster has stated that it is " not likely " he will pull the show from future Emmy awards , considering that it reflects on his and his crew 's hard work and high standards . The show has also been nominated and won several times for technical production ( Creative Arts ) Emmy awards , for Cinematography and Picture Editing for Non-Fiction programs , whereas it has only been nominated for Sound Mixing and Sound Editing for Non-Fiction programs . The show has been nominated in the same five categories for three years consecutively , a trend which continued with the 2007 Primetime Emmy Awards

		CONTEXT=When Jackson left the role in 1999 , a recast was opposed by viewers and costars . When Jackson 's departure had previously been rumored in 1996 , Anthony Geary ( Luke ) told '' TV Guide '' that he " went to ( the '' GH '' powers ) and said , ' If we lose him , then let 's kill Lucky . ' Jonathan is too much a part of us to replace him . " Geary repeated these sentiments when Jackson confirmed leaving in 1999 . When a recast was rumored in early 2000 , Jackson stated : " When all the actors who are going to be working with the character do n't want it , it 's kind of too bad that they still do it . But I do n't really get surprised with a lot of things that they do . " The role was recast with Jacob Young , and by the time he appeared on-screen in February 2000 , the character had been off-screen for almost a year , speculated to be an attempt to ease the transition between actors due to Jackson 's popularity . Young was able to become accepted by fans ; in 2001 , Candace Havens wrote in '' The Free Lance – Star '' : " His hard work has paid off and many fans ca n't even remember there was ever someone else in the role . " Young was named Sexiest Soap Star by '' People '' magazine in 2001 . In 2002 , Young won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actor . Greg Vaughan , who took over the role from 2003 to 2009 , was the only portrayer of Lucky not to be nominated for an Emmy award . However , Vaughan did have a fan following . He was chosen by ABC Daytime and SOAPnet to participate in their 2008 Hot Guys Calendar , featuring popular male costars from ABC soap operas . At the start of 2008 , '' Zap2it '' named Vaughan No. 6 on their Top 10 Most Improved list , stating : " The gorgeous Mr. Vaughan plays angry and sexy very well . Thank goodness we 're getting to see it . " During Vaughan 's tenure , Lucky entered into a relationship with Sam McCall ( Kelly Monaco ) that was popular with fans . '' Zap2it '' named them No. 6 on their list of Top Couples of 2007 , and tied them for No. 3 in 2008 along with entangled couple Elizabeth ( Herbst ) and Jason Morgan ( Steve Burton ) , stating : " Lucky and Sam were conceived out of a revenge plot , yet quickly surprised fans and execs alike with their instant chemistry . Is the Quad in for another partner-switching shake-up in 2009 ? " When Vaughan left in 2009 , he reflected on his reception : " I am grateful as to how the fans embraced me , whether they liked me or not . It was my job to win them over and I did that in due time . " Some felt Vaughan was not a good fit for the character . In April 2008 , Allison Waldman of '' The Huffington Post '' named Jackson as one of the top ten actors to make an impact on '' General Hospital '' , stating : " He 's still the real Lucky to many people , even though two other actors have subsequently played the part . " When Jackson was hired to reprise the role in 2009 , his return was highly anticipated , but accompanied by controversy as Vaughan was let go in order to bring Jackson back . Fans had a bittersweet reaction to the switch . The network promoted Jackson 's return with the phrase , " Elizabeth 's first love is back ! " , which angered some of Vaughan 's fans . However , ratings rose the week Jackson returned , and his performance was well received . Jackson was nominated for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series in 2010 , only having been with the show for three months of 2009 . Jackson 's return changed the dynamic of the Elizabeth and Nikolas affair storyline , which had a negative reception from fans who thought it did not align with the history between Herbst and Jackson . The scenes in early 2010 where Lucky confronts Elizabeth and Nikolas about their affair received praise . That April , '' We Love Soaps '' named Jackson No. 26 of the top 50 Greatest Soap Actors , Damon L. Jacobs commenting : " From that first scene as Lucky in the Canadian diner , to his recent scenes of betrayal railing against Elizabeth and Nikolas , Jonathan adds a profound depth and spiritual gravity to the scripted words that is far beyond his years . His piercing bloodshot eyes shoot daggers far more deadly than Sonny 's guns , and his smile encapsulates all that was celebrated about Luke and Laura 's connection . " Michael Logan of '' TV Guide '' named Jackson the best actor of 2010 , referencing the affair confrontation when stating : Jackson submitted those scenes for the 38th Daytime Emmy Awards , where he won his fourth Daytime Emmy Award and first win as Outstanding Supporting Actor . The scenes were compared to classics such as Judith Light 's performance of Karen Wolek 's courtroom confession scene on '' One Life to Live '' and Kim Zimmer ’s performance of Reva Shayne 's fountain scene on '' Guiding Light '' . Jackson 's on-screen chemistry with Erin Chambers ( Siobhan ) also had a positive reception at the end of 2010 . However the following year they were rated the No. 6 Worst Soap Opera Couple of 2011 by '' Zap2it '' , who stated : " We spent 2011 desperately clinging to those few early memories , as Siobhan transformed from an appealing character into a shrill , insecure harpy ( ... ) Try as Jackson and Chambers might , the actors were unable to salvage an ounce of their prior appeal as a couple . " On the other hand , the entertainment website named Jackson No. 3 of the Top 10 Male Entertainers that year . Jackson had a range of emotional work in 2011 that received acclaim , including the scenes following the death of Lucky 's son Jake , a storyline met by criticism by some fans . In 2012 , Jackson won his fifth Daytime Emmy Award for his scenes where Lucky tells Luke that Luke was the driver that hit Jake and confronts him about his drinking . When Jackson was nominated , '' On-Air On-Soaps '' stated :

		CONTEXT=The ceremony was held on a night other than Sunday for the first time since 1976 ( the 28th Primetime Emmy Awards were also staged on a Monday that year , May 17 ) . The ceremony 's unusual date — a Monday night in late August — was due to two factors , primary being NBC 's commitment to '' Sunday Night Football '' ; since acquiring the National Football League 's Sunday night game package in 2006 , NBC , when it is their turn in the four-network rotation to air the Primetime Emmy Awards , usually schedules the ceremony for the Sunday before Labor Day weekend , to avoid conflicts with '' SNF '' in mid-September ( when ABC , CBS , or Fox normally air the ceremony ) . NBC 's ideal date on the 2014 calendar for the ceremony ( Sunday , August 24 ) led to the other scheduling factor — MTV 's Video Music Awards , which were set for that night more than a year in advance ( and would be staged in the L.A. area as well , at The Forum in Inglewood ) . On January 28 , 2014 , rather than go head-to-head with the VMA 's , NBC announced that the ceremony would take place on Monday , August 25 . The move would allow NBC to commit to a preseason '' Sunday Night Football '' broadcast for the 24th ( a game between the Cincinnati Bengals and Arizona Cardinals ) ; it also ensured the tradition of staging the Primetime Emmy Awards the weekend after the Creative Arts Emmy Awards ( that ceremony was already set for August 16 )

Its streak was ended in 2010 when '' Top Chef '' won the Emmy for this category . Host Phil Keoghan revealed in an interview that the show 's loss that year made him and the producers realize that they will have to try harder to win the Emmy again . In 2011 , the show won in the category again for the eighth time . After its seventh consecutive win , some in the media , including '' Survivor '' host Jeff Probst suggested that '' The Amazing Race '' willingly drop out from the competition in future years , similar to Candice Bergen declining any further nominations after her fifth Emmy win for her role in '' Murphy Brown '' . Van Munster has stated that it is " not likely " he will pull the show from future Emmy awards , considering that it reflects on his and his crew 's hard work and high standards . The show has also been nominated and won several times for technical production ( Creative Arts ) Emmy awards , for Cinematography and Picture Editing for Non-Fiction programs , whereas it has only been nominated for Sound Mixing and Sound Editing for Non-Fiction programs .

Although Pennsylvania had outlawed slavery , many conservative Pennsylvanians believed that the federal government should not interfere with the institution of slavery . One such individual was Democrat James Buchanan , the last pre-Civil War president . Buchanan 's party had generally won presidential and gubernatorial elections in Pennsylvania . However , the nascent Republican Party 's first convention took place in Philadelphia , and the 1860 elections saw the Republican Party win the state 's presidential vote and the governor 's office . After the failure of the Crittenden Compromise , the secession of the South , and the Battle of Fort Sumter , the Civil War began with Pennsylvania as a key member of the Union . Despite the Republican victory the 1860 election , Democrats remained powerful in the state , and several " copperheads " called for peace during the war . The Democrats re-took control of the state legislature in the 1862 election , but incumbent Republican Governor Andrew Curtin retained control of the governorship in 1863 . In the 1864 election , President Lincoln narrowly defeated Pennsylvania native George B. McClellan for the state 's electoral votes

		CONTEXT=Haphazard is a historic house located on Pleasant Valley Road in Owensboro , Kentucky . The house overlooks the Ohio River , and its name is probably derived from the river 's eddies . The property which Haphazard was built on was originally owned by George Mason , a signatory to the U.S. Constitution , who was given the land in a grant surveyed in 1787 . Mason 's grandson Richard sold the property to Robert Triplett in 1822 , by which point the log house forming the central portion of the home had been built . Triplett likely added the house 's side wings , northern gable , and Federal style interior . Triplett accomplished many local firsts , as he was Owensboro 's first large real estate dealer ; Daviess County 's first soil conservationist , barge operator , and author ; the first distiller on the Ohio River in the county ; and the builder of Kentucky 's first railroad . In 1843 , A. B. Barret purchased the house from Triplett ; Barret then sold the house to William Bell the following year . Bell , the president of a local bank , likely added the house 's Greek Revival portico .

QUERY_CONTEXT=The first official Republican convention in Illinois was held on May 29 , 1856 , in Bloomington . Chairman John M. Palmer was elected convention president after his opening address . Nine vice presidents and five secretaries were then elected . The convention nominated Bissell for governor with Francis Hoffmann as lieutenant governor , Ozias M. Hatch for secretary of state , Jesse K. Dubois as auditor , and James Miller as treasurer . Hoffmann was found to be ineligible for his position due to a residency requirement , and John Wood was nominated in his place . The following resolutions defining the party platform were approved : Resolved , That foregoing all former differences of opinions upon other questions , we pledge ourselves to unite in opposition to the present administration and to the party which upholds and supports it and to use all honorable and constitutional means to wrest the Government from the unworthy hands which now control it and to bring it back in its administration to the principles and practices of Washington , Jefferson and their great and good compatriots of the Revolution . Resolved , That foregoing all former differences of opinions upon other questions , we pledge ourselves to unite in opposition to the present administration of the Government ; that under the Constitution Congress possesses the power to prohibit slavery in the Territories ; and that , whilst we will maintain all constitutional rights of the South , we also hold that justice , humanity , the principles of freedom as expressed in our Declaration of Independence and our national constitution , and the purity and perpetuity of our Government require that that power shall be exerted to prevent the extension of slavery into territory heretofore free . Resolved , That the repeal of the Missouri Compromise was unwise and injurious ; an open and aggravated violation of the plighted faith of the States , and that the attempt of the present administration to force slavery into Kansas against the known wishes of the legal voters of that Territory is an arbitrary and tyrannous violation of the rights of the people to govern themselves , and that we will strive by all constitutional means to secure to Kansas and Nebraska the legal guaranty against slavery of which they were deprived at the cost of the violation of the plighted faith of the nation . Resolved , That we are devoted to the Union and will , to the last extremity , defend it against the efforts now being made by the dis-unionists of this administration to compass its dissolution , and that we will support the Constitution of the United States , in all its provisions regarding it , as the sacred bond of our Union and the only safeguard for the preservation of the rights of ourselves and our posterity . Resolved , That we are in favor of the immediate admission of Kansas as a member of this Confederacy under the constitution adopted by the people of said Territory . Resolved , That the spirit of our institutions as well as the Constitution of our country , guarantees the liberty of conscience as well as political freedom , and that we will proscribe no one by legislation or otherwise on account of religious opinions , or in consequence of place of birth . Lincoln delivered the closing address . The speech was purportedly so captivating that no reporter made a record of it . The address has become known as Lincoln 's Lost Speech . The delegates to the convention were : The Democrats had nominated Richardson for governor at their convention earlier that month . The remnants of the Whig party declined to run a candidate .

The property which Haphazard was built on was originally owned by George Mason , a signatory to the U.S. Constitution , who was given the land in a grant surveyed in 1787 . Mason 's grandson Richard sold the property to Robert Triplett in 1822 , by which point the log house forming the central portion of the home had been built . Triplett likely added the house 's side wings , northern gable , and Federal style interior . Triplett accomplished many local firsts , as he was Owensboro 's first large real estate dealer ; Daviess County 's first soil conservationist , barge operator , and author ; the first distiller on the Ohio River in the county ; and the builder of Kentucky 's first railroad . In 1843 , A. B. Barret purchased the house from Triplett ; Barret then sold the house to William Bell the following year . Bell , the president of a local bank , likely added the house 's Greek Revival portico .

		CONTEXT=He arrived at the club as an incredibly shy and underdeveloped personality , a fact that was noted by teammate Trent Cotchin who said though Martin was 18 “ he seemed much younger in some of the ways he behaved . ” Indeed , he struggled initially to adjust to the expectations of professional football . In one incident in the 2010 preseason he was removed from training and verbally reprimanded by club leadership when he was deemed unfit to train after a big night out . Despite these struggles , his on-field development was such that he would still debut in the 2010 season 's opening match , a 56-point Richmond loss against at the MCG . Martin recorded the sixth most disposals of any Tiger ( 18 ) to go along with four marks , three tackles and three clearances . Two weeks later Martin was convicted by the AFL tribunal for a high hit on Sydney 's Josh Kennedy in round 3 . He did not receive a suspension for the incident however , returning to football the following week . After four matches Martin ranked fourth in the league for clearances and eighth for hard-ball gets . Media reports emerged after round 8 that the 18 year old Martin had received a significant contract offer from expansion club the Greater Western Sydney Giants . The offer , which the Herald Sun ’s Mark Robinson claimed to be worth $ 2.4 million over three seasons , would have taken effect in the new club 's first AFL season in 2012 . Martin later said he had never entertained the idea of moving to the start-up club . In round 10 he had gained attention for his on-field efforts again , this time being nominated for the 2010 AFL Rising Star award after a 21 disposal and 11 clearance match against Port Adelaide . Due to his previous tribunal conviction however , Martin was ruled ineligible for the award and thus did not officially place in the end of season award 's points tally . He drew the attention of Sydney coach Paul Roos by round 14 , prompting Roos to send veteran Brett Kirk onto Martin in a tagging role . Despite this extra attention , he still managed to record 18 disposals and a goal in the match at the MCG . After 17 rounds Martin ranked second at the club for clearances and inside 50s as well as third for disposals and contested possessions . At the same time he ranked first among that season 's Rising Star nominees in clearances , contested possessions and inside 50s . He was also fourth for average disposals and fifth for average tackles . In round 19 he was rested by the club before returning to play out the final five matches of the season . He missed just that one game in his debut season and finished the year ranked second at Richmond for clearances and inside 50s , as well as third for both contested possessions and disposals . In addition to winning the Fred Swift Medal for fourth place at the club 's best and fairest night , Martin also received six votes in the Brownlow Medal count that year , the most by any Richmond debutant since Craig Lambert in 1988 . At season 's end he reiterated his commitment to the club ( and rejection of the former GWS overtures ) by signing a two-year contract extension that would keep him at Richmond until the end of the 2013 season . The extension was reported by the Herald Sun to be in the vicinity of $ 400,000-a-year

In addition to winning the Fred Swift Medal for fourth place at the club 's best and fairest night , Martin also received six votes in the Brownlow Medal count that year , the most by any Richmond debutant since Craig Lambert in 1988 . At season 's end he reiterated his commitment to the club ( and rejection of the former GWS overtures ) by signing a two-year contract extension that would keep him at Richmond until the end of the 2013 season . The extension was reported by the Herald Sun to be in the vicinity of $ 400,000-a-year

		CONTEXT=He arrived at the club as an incredibly shy and underdeveloped personality , a fact that was noted by teammate Trent Cotchin who said though Martin was 18 “ he seemed much younger in some of the ways he behaved . ” Indeed , he struggled initially to adjust to the expectations of professional football . In one incident in the 2010 preseason he was removed from training and verbally reprimanded by club leadership when he was deemed unfit to train after a big night out . Despite these struggles , his on-field development was such that he would still debut in the 2010 season 's opening match , a 56-point Richmond loss against at the MCG . Martin recorded the sixth most disposals of any Tiger ( 18 ) to go along with four marks , three tackles and three clearances . Two weeks later Martin was convicted by the AFL tribunal for a high hit on Sydney 's Josh Kennedy in round 3 . He did not receive a suspension for the incident however , returning to football the following week . After four matches Martin ranked fourth in the league for clearances and eighth for hard-ball gets . Media reports emerged after round 8 that the 18 year old Martin had received a significant contract offer from expansion club the Greater Western Sydney Giants . The offer , which the Herald Sun ’s Mark Robinson claimed to be worth $ 2.4 million over three seasons , would have taken effect in the new club 's first AFL season in 2012 . Martin later said he had never entertained the idea of moving to the start-up club . In round 10 he had gained attention for his on-field efforts again , this time being nominated for the 2010 AFL Rising Star award after a 21 disposal and 11 clearance match against Port Adelaide . Due to his previous tribunal conviction however , Martin was ruled ineligible for the award and thus did not officially place in the end of season award 's points tally . He drew the attention of Sydney coach Paul Roos by round 14 , prompting Roos to send veteran Brett Kirk onto Martin in a tagging role . Despite this extra attention , he still managed to record 18 disposals and a goal in the match at the MCG . After 17 rounds Martin ranked second at the club for clearances and inside 50s as well as third for disposals and contested possessions . At the same time he ranked first among that season 's Rising Star nominees in clearances , contested possessions and inside 50s . He was also fourth for average disposals and fifth for average tackles . In round 19 he was rested by the club before returning to play out the final five matches of the season . He missed just that one game in his debut season and finished the year ranked second at Richmond for clearances and inside 50s , as well as third for both contested possessions and disposals . In addition to winning the Fred Swift Medal for fourth place at the club 's best and fairest night , Martin also received six votes in the Brownlow Medal count that year , the most by any Richmond debutant since Craig Lambert in 1988 . At season 's end he reiterated his commitment to the club ( and rejection of the former GWS overtures ) by signing a two-year contract extension that would keep him at Richmond until the end of the 2013 season . The extension was reported by the Herald Sun to be in the vicinity of $ 400,000-a-year

Cohl now runs S2BN Entertainment , with offices in New York and Toronto . Having been named the Howard Hughes of rock ‘ n ’ roll by '' Fortune '' magazine , Cohl is most famous for having overseen the tours and related ancillary businesses for more than 150 artists , including Frank Sinatra , Michael Jackson , The Rolling Stones , Prince , Stevie Wonder , Pink Floyd , Crosby , Stills , Nash and Young and U2 . He has also been credited with developing the concept of " package " touring . Eliminating the middleman , Cohl worked directly with the artist to strategize and route the tour , promote the dates , and assist in the development and exploitation of the lucrative aftermarket – books , films , DVDs , television specials , and merchandising . He is currently the lead producer of '' Spider-Man : Turn Off the Dark '' , the most expensive musical in Broadway history , with music by Bono and The Edge of U2 . In December 1995 , The Toronto Star printed a 4,000 word article entitled " King Cohl of Rock 'n' Roll and the Tax That Never Was . " From conversations with a number of managers of touring bands , the reporter argued that Cohl 's Concert Productions International misrepresented to touring artists that it was collecting a tax , while not remitting any such tax to any government body . The tax was a phoney tax Cohl added onto every ticket he sold at Toronto 's CNE Stadium . Fans paid an extra $ 3 per ticket for Springsteen , U2 , and Stones tickets . According to Canadian government auditors , that $ 3 per ticket added up to $ 5 million , all of which was pocketed by Cohl . He avoided jail time but had to sell back his BCL Entertainment Ltd stock to Labatt 's . Cohl was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame , when he received a Walt Grealis Special Achievement Award at the 2002 Juno Awards . Cohl is also a recipient of the 2004 Billboard Legend of Live award , an honour previously bestowed on such artists as Elton John and The Allman Brothers Band .

He was inducted in Canada 's Walk of Fame in 2005 Cohl has produced several Broadway musicals as well as numerous other international touring shows . These include : CBC Television released a 2006 documentary directed by acclaimed filmmaker Barry Avrich as part of the '' Life and Times '' series chronicling Cohl 's rise to prominence in the entertainment industry .

QUERY_CONTEXT=" Motivation " is a R&B slow jam song written by Richard Butler ( Rico Love ) , Jim Jonsin , Dwayne Carter and Danny Morris . The racy lyrics center around Rowland asking her man to use his hands all over her body , and are accompanied by a " synth-saturated beat " produced by Jonsin . In terms of instruments , " Motivation " uses sparse keyboard notes , programmed beats and pulsing synths in the chorus . Wayne adds a rap verse complementing Rowland 's seductive suggestions , using the kitchen and a car as metaphors for sex . According to Scott Shetler from AOL Music , Rowland uses the lyrics to promise " to be her lover 's motivation . " Rowland called the record a mixture between dance and mash-up . When asked by MTV what Rowland thought of the song , she said , " It has that personality and characteristic to it that I do n't think anybody can deny . That 's why when Wayne dropped that insane verse on there ... I was like , ' You really brought that up even more . ' He went into the studio and just did it . I do n't think it takes much for Wayne to think . He just does it . He 's so admirable . " Ryan Brockington , from the '' New York Post , '' was amongst the first to review " Motivation . " In his review , he said " The single is a big leap from the dance club synth pop that Kelly has been releasing the past year and it seems like she might be trying to shimmy her way back into the hip-hop world by teaming up with the Midas touch vocals of Lil Wayne . " Both '' Rap-Up '' and AOL Music 's Scott Shetler called the song " sexy . " Becky Bain from Idolator disliked the song for not being memorable . The short review was summed up with the closing phrase , " she ’s going to need another hit to help promote her album when it finally is ready to drop . " Wesley Case from '' The Baltimore Sun '' complemented the song 's sexy quality . " If this is n't the year 's hands-down sexiest song thus far , it has to be in the discussion . Rowland , whose sultry voice could get a priest hot , weaving in and out of the minimal beat , and setting the table for Lil Wayne 's stuttering , after-hours guest-verse . Stack the pieces together and it 's an understated knockout that gets sexier with each spin .

		SCORE=1.5713933407823788e-05
		CONTEXT=Rasputin 's daughter Maria died in the 2006 crash of S7 Airlines Flight 778 , and his wife died six years later . He died in Moscow on 14 March 2015 , a day short of his 78th birthday . Patriarch Kirill of the Russian Orthodox Church conducted his funeral service , and President Vladimir Putin paid his respects . ( In 2014 Rasputin had co-signed a letter by writers in support of Putin 's annexation of the Crimea . ) Rasputin is closely associated with a movement in post-war Soviet literature known as " village prose , " or sometimes " rural prose " ( деревенская проза ) . Beginning in the time of the Khrushchev Thaw ( оттепель ) , village prose was praised for its stylistic and thematic departures from socialist realism . Village prose works usually focused on the hardships of the Soviet peasantry , espoused an idealized picture of traditional village life , and implicitly or explicitly criticized official modernization projects . Rasputin 's 1979 novel '' Farewell to Matyora '' , which depicts a fictional Siberian village which is to be evacuated and cleared so that a hydroelectric dam can be constructed further down the Angara River , was considered the epitome of this genre . The opening paragraph below is a good example of Rasputin 's writing style ( exceptional even for the village prose writers ) , and the novel 's theme of natural cycles disrupted by modernization : '' Once more spring had come , one more in the never-ending cycle , but for Matyora this spring would be the last , the last for both the island and the village that bore the same name . Once more , rumbling passionately , the ice broke , piling up mounds on the banks , and the liberated Angara River opened up , stretching out into a mighty , sparkling flow . Once more the water gushed boisterously at the island ’s upper tip , before cascading down both channels of the riverbed ; once more greenery flared on the ground and in the greens , the first rains soaked the earth , the swifts and swallows flew back , and at dusk in the bogs the awakened frogs croaked their love of life . It had all happened many times before . '' ( From Rasputin 's novel '' Farewell to Matyora '' , translated by Antonina W. Bouis , 1979 ) Rasputin 's nonfiction works contain similar themes , often in support of relevant political causes . He directed particularly trenchant criticism at large-scale dam building , like the project that flooded his own hometown , and water management projects , like the diversion of the Siberian rivers to Central Asia . He argued that these projects were destructive not simply in an ecological sense , but in a moral sense as well

		SCORE=8.215586603910197e-06
		CONTEXT=While the accusation of lax security in the Kremlin was the pretext for humiliating Yenukidze , the real reason may have been his failure to contribute adequately to the glorification of Stalin . In particular , memoirs published in the 1920s , including Yenukidze 's , attribute the creation of the illegal printing press in Baku principally to the late Lado Ketskhoveli , and made no mention of Stalin , who was then based in Tiflis , being involved . He complained privately of being under pressure to change the record for Stalin 's benefit , saying : " I am doing everything he has asked me to do , but it is not enough for him . He wants me to admit that he is a genius . " On 16 January 1935 , Yenukdize was forced to publish a public apology , altering the record to say that Ketskhoveli was ' sent to Baku ' by Stalin and others to set up and to create the party organisation in Baku . Six months later , Beria published a history of the Bolshevik organisation in Transcaucasia which accused Yenukidze of having " deliberately and with hostile intent " falsified the record . Yenukidze was arrested on 11 February 1937 . During the purges , it was comparatively rare for the Soviet press to publicise executions , apart from those of the defendants at show trials .

		CONTEXT=During the summer of 2011 , Valiquette turned down an offer to return to Lokomotiv Yaroslavl , due to a lack of guaranteed playing time . This proved fortunate for him , in light of the Lokomotiv Yaroslavl plane crash , which killed nearly the entire team and staff . Unsigned and not playing , it was announced in November 2011 that Valiquette , who runs a goalie school of his own , was taking a position at Quinnipiac University as the volunteer goalie coach for the men 's NCAA team . However , a couple of days later , the AHL 's Bridgeport Sound Tigers , for whom Valiquette had played while in the Islanders ' system , put out a call for an emergency backup , as they were shorthanded due to injuries with their Islanders parent club . Ultimately , Valiquette wound up not having to play for the Sound Tigers , and moved on to play for HC Valpellice of the Italian Serie A league , which in 14 games , he led in save percentage and goals against average . After his season at HC Valpellice , Valiquette signed with Swedish club Djurgården of the HockeyAllsvenskan league , but instead retired due to injury

		SCORE=0.00042588489304762334
		CONTEXT=Safety has long been a concern in the mining business , especially in sub-surface mining . The Courrières mine disaster , Europe 's worst mining accident , involved the death of 1,099 miners in Northern France on March 10 , 1906 . This disaster was surpassed only by the Benxihu Colliery accident in China on April 26 , 1942 , which killed 1,549 miners . While mining today is substantially safer than it was in previous decades , mining accidents still occur . Government figures indicate that 5,000 Chinese miners die in accidents each year , while other reports have suggested a figure as high as 20,000 . Mining accidents continue worldwide , including accidents causing dozens of fatalities at a time such as the 2007 Ulyanovskaya Mine disaster in Russia , the 2009 Heilongjiang mine explosion in China , and the 2010 Upper Big Branch Mine disaster in the United States . Mining has been identified by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ( NIOSH ) as a priority industry sector in the National Occupational Research Agenda ( NORA ) to identify and provide intervention strategies regarding occupational health and safety issues . The Mining Safety and Health Administration ( MSHA ) was established in 1978 to " work to prevent death , illness , and injury from mining and promote safe and healthful workplaces for US miners . " Since its implementation in 1978 , the number of miner fatalities has decreased from 242 miners in 1978 to 28 miners in 2015

		CONTEXT=While the accusation of lax security in the Kremlin was the pretext for humiliating Yenukidze , the real reason may have been his failure to contribute adequately to the glorification of Stalin . In particular , memoirs published in the 1920s , including Yenukidze 's , attribute the creation of the illegal printing press in Baku principally to the late Lado Ketskhoveli , and made no mention of Stalin , who was then based in Tiflis , being involved . He complained privately of being under pressure to change the record for Stalin 's benefit , saying : " I am doing everything he has asked me to do , but it is not enough for him . He wants me to admit that he is a genius . " On 16 January 1935 , Yenukdize was forced to publish a public apology , altering the record to say that Ketskhoveli was ' sent to Baku ' by Stalin and others to set up and to create the party organisation in Baku . Six months later , Beria published a history of the Bolshevik organisation in Transcaucasia which accused Yenukidze of having " deliberately and with hostile intent " falsified the record . Yenukidze was arrested on 11 February 1937 . During the purges , it was comparatively rare for the Soviet press to publicise executions , apart from those of the defendants at show trials . In a rare exception to this rule , it was reported in '' Pravda '' that Yenukdize and six others had been tried in private on 15 December 1937 , and executed on 20 December . His co-defendants were said to have been the Armenian diplomat , Lev Karakhan , the former Georgian party secretary Mamia Orakhelashvili , two former leading official from the North Caucasus , V.F.Larin and Boris Sheboldayev , the diplomat Vladimir Tsukerman , and the mysterious ' Baron ' Boris Steiger .

		CONTEXT=The Temple of Bacchus — once wrongly credited to Jupiter — may have been completed under Septimius Severus in the 190s , as his coins are the first to show it beside the Temple of Jupiter . It is the best preserved of the sanctuary 's structures , as the other rubble from its ruins protected it . It is enriched by some of the most refined reliefs and sculpture to survive from antiquity . The temple is surrounded by forty-two columns — 8 along each end and 15 along each side — nearly in height . These were probably erected in a rough state and then rounded , polished , and decorated in position . The entrance was preserved as late as Pococke and Wood , but the keystone of the lintel had slid following the 1759 earthquakes ; a column of rough masonry was erected in the 1860s or '70s to support it . The 1759 earthquakes also damaged the area around the soffit 's famed inscription of an eagle , which was entirely covered by the keystone 's supporting column.The area around the inscription of the eagle was greatly damaged by the 1759 earthquake . The interior of the temple is divided into a nave and a adytum or sanctuary on a platform raised above it and fronted by 13 steps . The screen between the two sections once held reliefs of Neptune , Triton , Arion and his dolphin , and other marine figures but these have been lost . The temple was used as a kind of donjon for the medieval Arab and Turkish fortifications , although its eastern steps were lost sometime after 1688 . Much of the portico was incorporated into a huge wall directly before its gate , but this was demolished in July 1870 by Barker on orders from Syria 's governor Rashid Pasha . Two spiral staircases in columns on either side of the entrance lead to the roof

		CONTEXT=Crank is a condition in which a ship heels abnormally , and recovers slowly under the action of the wind . If a ship makes long , slow rolls and takes time resuming a vertical position , it is referred to as crank , cranky , crank - sided , tender , or tender - sided . If the ship snaps back to its vertical position when heeled , it is called ʻstiff.ʼ Stiffness refers to a ship 's power to stand up to her canvas , and will offer great resistance to inclination from the upright , when under sail . Although stiff is considered good in the case of many ships , there are extreme cases in which the vessel will be too stiff and resist the tendency to heel under wind pressure , which may cause damage to masts , rigging , and structure .

Japan occupied Taiwan for the rest of 1874 and then left owing to Chinese pressures , but in 1879 it finally annexed the Ryukyu Islands . In 1875 Qing China sent a 300-men force to subdue the Taiwanese cannibals , but unlike the Japanese the Chinese were routed , ambushed and 250 of their men were killed ; the failure of this expedition exposed once more the failure of Qing China to exert effective control in Taiwan , and acted as another incentive for the Japanese to annex Taiwan .

		CONTEXT=" Motivation " is a R&B slow jam song written by Richard Butler ( Rico Love ) , Jim Jonsin , Dwayne Carter and Danny Morris . The racy lyrics center around Rowland asking her man to use his hands all over her body , and are accompanied by a " synth-saturated beat " produced by Jonsin . In terms of instruments , " Motivation " uses sparse keyboard notes , programmed beats and pulsing synths in the chorus . Wayne adds a rap verse complementing Rowland 's seductive suggestions , using the kitchen and a car as metaphors for sex . According to Scott Shetler from AOL Music , Rowland uses the lyrics to promise " to be her lover 's motivation . " Rowland called the record a mixture between dance and mash-up . When asked by MTV what Rowland thought of the song , she said , " It has that personality and characteristic to it that I do n't think anybody can deny . That 's why when Wayne dropped that insane verse on there ... I was like , ' You really brought that up even more . ' He went into the studio and just did it . I do n't think it takes much for Wayne to think . He just does it . He 's so admirable . " Ryan Brockington , from the '' New York Post , '' was amongst the first to review " Motivation . " In his review , he said " The single is a big leap from the dance club synth pop that Kelly has been releasing the past year and it seems like she might be trying to shimmy her way back into the hip-hop world by teaming up with the Midas touch vocals of Lil Wayne . " Both '' Rap-Up '' and AOL Music 's Scott Shetler called the song " sexy . " Becky Bain from Idolator disliked the song for not being memorable . The short review was summed up with the closing phrase , " she ’s going to need another hit to help promote her album when it finally is ready to drop . " Wesley Case from '' The Baltimore Sun '' complemented the song 's sexy quality . " If this is n't the year 's hands-down sexiest song thus far , it has to be in the discussion . Rowland , whose sultry voice could get a priest hot , weaving in and out of the minimal beat , and setting the table for Lil Wayne 's stuttering , after-hours guest-verse . Stack the pieces together and it 's an understated knockout that gets sexier with each spin .

Many prominent figures in Russian politics expressed outrage about Khabarov 's imprisonment . Among them are individuals with diametrically opposed political views such as the presidential candidates Leonid Ivashov and Gennady Zyuganov , as well as other political figures , such as Andrey Illarionov , Andrey Savelyev , Maxim Shevchenko , Alexey Dymovsky , Maxim Kalashnikov , Irek Murtazin , Mikhail Delyagin , Ashot Egiazaryan , Aleksandr Kharchikov , Dmitry Puchkov , '' et al. '' They said that the accusations do not hold water , pointing to the ridiculousness of the collected “ evidence ” against Khabarov . Khabarov 's colleague , Col. Vladislav Zyomkovsky , said during an interview with '' PublicPost '' , that officially announced denunciation of a failed masterplan doesn ′ t stand up to critical examination , and if examined , the argument simply falls to the ground . In his opinion , a brilliant military strategist such as Khabarov , would never develop such an obvious plan . To refute the official version of the failed plot , Zyomkovsky cited one paragraph from Khabarov 's bill of indictment , which states that Khabarov and his alleged accomplices planned to switch off the entire region 's electrical grid , and thus create panic and civil disorder . In his opinion , this passage was copypasted from an indictment of the criminal trials of the 1930s , when such an event would really have spread chaos . But in the 2000s in Russia , electrical outages happened on a daily basis , were routine and a quite common occurrence

		CONTEXT=Hunt starred in Woody Allen 's '' The Curse of the Jade Scorpion '' ( 2001 ) , as an efficiency expert hypnotized by a crooked hypnotist into stealing jewels . Despite the film 's limited success , Roger Ebert asserted : " Hunt in particular has fun with a wisecracking dame role that owes something , perhaps , to Rosalind Russell in '' His Girl Friday '' . " In 2003 , Hunt returned to Broadway in Yasmina Reza 's '' Life x 3 '' , and in 2004 , she starred in the drama '' A Good Woman '' , as a femme fatale in 1930s NYC . '' AV Club '' , in its review for the latter , remarked : " Helen Hunt looks embarrassingly out of place trying to play an infamous seductress " . She played a socialite , as part of an ensemble cast , in Emilio Estevez 's drama '' Bobby '' ( 2006 ) , about the hours leading up to the Robert F. Kennedy assassination . As a member of the cast , she was nominated for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Cast in a Motion Picture but won the Hollywood Film Festival Award for Best Ensemble Cast . Hunt made her feature film directorial debut in '' Then She Found Me '' ( 2007 ) , in which she also starred as a 39-year-old Brooklyn elementary school teacher , who after years is contacted by the flamboyant host of a local talk show , played by Bette Midler , who introduces herself as her biological mother . After first reading Elinor Lipman 's novel , she tried to interest numerous studios in the material , and her unsuccessful efforts led her to begin writing the screenplay and raising funds to produce it herself . Upon its release , Ruthe Stein of the '' San Francisco Chronicle '' observed , " You would think that frontloading '' Then She Found Me '' with so much plot would make it play like a soap opera . But Hunt saves the movie from this fate in two ways . First she turns in a touchingly real performance , the best of her big-screen career . Forget that '' As Good as It Gets '' won her an Oscar . She 's eons better and more realistic in this one ... By directing '' Then She Found Me '' , Helen becomes its savior as well ... Hunt knows when to rein in the Divine Miss M instead of allowing her to go into full Kabuki mode . She also coaxes pitch-perfect performances from Broderick and Firth . " Hunt starred in the dramedy '' Every Day '' ( 2010 ) , as one half of a married couple pulled apart by increasing responsibilities . According to '' Los Angeles Times '' , the film " comes as a reminder of Hunt 's talent for understatement , and a wish to see more of her " . In the biographical drama '' Soul Surfer '' ( 2011 ) , she played the mother of the Hawaiian-born champion surfer Bethany Hamilton , on whose life the film was based . Her first wide release since 2001 's '' The Curse of the Jade Scorpion '' , '' Soul Surfer '' made US$ 47.1 million internationally . Hunt starred as sex surrogate Cheryl Cohen-Greene in '' The Sessions '' ( 2012 ) , alongside John Hawkes and William H. Macy . The role required Hunt to perform multiple scenes of full-frontal nudity , on which she further said : " Being naked was challenging , but even more than that was the vulnerability . I felt vulnerable because I was naked . I felt vulnerable because we were having such a vulnerable moment in this character 's life . This was a real journey that someone had gone on , and I wanted to do right by that . " Her performance was acclaimed by critics and earned her several award nominations , including an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress . Todd McCarthy of '' The Hollywood Reporter '' wrote : " Hunt 's performance may be physically bold but is equally marked by its maturity and composure . " Hunt played research geneticist Mary-Claire King in the independent drama '' Decoding Annie Parker '' ( 2013 ) , which was released to a mixed critical response . She wrote and directed the drama '' Ride '' ( 2014 ) , in which she also starred as a mother who travels cross-country to California to be with her son after he decides to drop out of school and become a surfer . Rotten Tomatoes ' critical consensus read : " '' Ride '' reaffirms Helen Hunt 's immense acting talent — but suggests that she still needs time to develop as a director . " In '' The Miracle Season '' ( 2018 ) , based on the true story of the Iowa City West High School volleyball team , Hunt played Kathy Bresnahan , a volleyball coach

		CONTEXT=When Jackson left the role in 1999 , a recast was opposed by viewers and costars . When Jackson 's departure had previously been rumored in 1996 , Anthony Geary ( Luke ) told '' TV Guide '' that he " went to ( the '' GH '' powers ) and said , ' If we lose him , then let 's kill Lucky . ' Jonathan is too much a part of us to replace him . " Geary repeated these sentiments when Jackson confirmed leaving in 1999 . When a recast was rumored in early 2000 , Jackson stated : " When all the actors who are going to be working with the character do n't want it , it 's kind of too bad that they still do it . But I do n't really get surprised with a lot of things that they do . " The role was recast with Jacob Young , and by the time he appeared on-screen in February 2000 , the character had been off-screen for almost a year , speculated to be an attempt to ease the transition between actors due to Jackson 's popularity . Young was able to become accepted by fans ; in 2001 , Candace Havens wrote in '' The Free Lance – Star '' : " His hard work has paid off and many fans ca n't even remember there was ever someone else in the role . " Young was named Sexiest Soap Star by '' People '' magazine in 2001 . In 2002 , Young won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actor . Greg Vaughan , who took over the role from 2003 to 2009 , was the only portrayer of Lucky not to be nominated for an Emmy award . However , Vaughan did have a fan following . He was chosen by ABC Daytime and SOAPnet to participate in their 2008 Hot Guys Calendar , featuring popular male costars from ABC soap operas . At the start of 2008 , '' Zap2it '' named Vaughan No. 6 on their Top 10 Most Improved list , stating : " The gorgeous Mr. Vaughan plays angry and sexy very well . Thank goodness we 're getting to see it . " During Vaughan 's tenure , Lucky entered into a relationship with Sam McCall ( Kelly Monaco ) that was popular with fans . '' Zap2it '' named them No. 6 on their list of Top Couples of 2007 , and tied them for No. 3 in 2008 along with entangled couple Elizabeth ( Herbst ) and Jason Morgan ( Steve Burton ) , stating : " Lucky and Sam were conceived out of a revenge plot , yet quickly surprised fans and execs alike with their instant chemistry . Is the Quad in for another partner-switching shake-up in 2009 ? " When Vaughan left in 2009 , he reflected on his reception : " I am grateful as to how the fans embraced me , whether they liked me or not . It was my job to win them over and I did that in due time . " Some felt Vaughan was not a good fit for the character . In April 2008 , Allison Waldman of '' The Huffington Post '' named Jackson as one of the top ten actors to make an impact on '' General Hospital '' , stating : " He 's still the real Lucky to many people , even though two other actors have subsequently played the part . " When Jackson was hired to reprise the role in 2009 , his return was highly anticipated , but accompanied by controversy as Vaughan was let go in order to bring Jackson back . Fans had a bittersweet reaction to the switch . The network promoted Jackson 's return with the phrase , " Elizabeth 's first love is back ! " , which angered some of Vaughan 's fans . However , ratings rose the week Jackson returned , and his performance was well received . Jackson was nominated for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series in 2010 , only having been with the show for three months of 2009 . Jackson 's return changed the dynamic of the Elizabeth and Nikolas affair storyline , which had a negative reception from fans who thought it did not align with the history between Herbst and Jackson . The scenes in early 2010 where Lucky confronts Elizabeth and Nikolas about their affair received praise . That April , '' We Love Soaps '' named Jackson No. 26 of the top 50 Greatest Soap Actors , Damon L. Jacobs commenting : " From that first scene as Lucky in the Canadian diner , to his recent scenes of betrayal railing against Elizabeth and Nikolas , Jonathan adds a profound depth and spiritual gravity to the scripted words that is far beyond his years . His piercing bloodshot eyes shoot daggers far more deadly than Sonny 's guns , and his smile encapsulates all that was celebrated about Luke and Laura 's connection . " Michael Logan of '' TV Guide '' named Jackson the best actor of 2010 , referencing the affair confrontation when stating : Jackson submitted those scenes for the 38th Daytime Emmy Awards , where he won his fourth Daytime Emmy Award and first win as Outstanding Supporting Actor . The scenes were compared to classics such as Judith Light 's performance of Karen Wolek 's courtroom confession scene on '' One Life to Live '' and Kim Zimmer ’s performance of Reva Shayne 's fountain scene on '' Guiding Light '' . Jackson 's on-screen chemistry with Erin Chambers ( Siobhan ) also had a positive reception at the end of 2010 . However the following year they were rated the No. 6 Worst Soap Opera Couple of 2011 by '' Zap2it '' , who stated : " We spent 2011 desperately clinging to those few early memories , as Siobhan transformed from an appealing character into a shrill , insecure harpy ( ... ) Try as Jackson and Chambers might , the actors were unable to salvage an ounce of their prior appeal as a couple . " On the other hand , the entertainment website named Jackson No. 3 of the Top 10 Male Entertainers that year . Jackson had a range of emotional work in 2011 that received acclaim , including the scenes following the death of Lucky 's son Jake , a storyline met by criticism by some fans . In 2012 , Jackson won his fifth Daytime Emmy Award for his scenes where Lucky tells Luke that Luke was the driver that hit Jake and confronts him about his drinking . When Jackson was nominated , '' On-Air On-Soaps '' stated :

" Film critic Roger Ebert said that Stewart was " on target , topical and funny , " and added , " He was as relaxed , amusing and at home as Johnny Carson . " Columnist Ray Richmond of '' The Hollywood Reporter '' commented , " He seemed at times nervous and self-conscious , but on the whole , Stewart delivered with just the right balance of reverence and smugness . " Others media publications were more critical of the show . Television critic Rob Owen of the '' Pittsburgh Post-Gazette '' wrote that Stewart was more " amusing than funny " . He added , " Many of his jokes fell flat with the stars in the Kodak Theatre , and his tendency to bow down before celebrities quickly grew tiresome . " Tom Shales from '' The Washington Post '' commented , " It 's hard to believe that professional entertainers could have put together a show less entertaining than this year 's Oscars , hosted with a smug humorlessness by comic Jon Stewart , a sad and pale shadow of great hosts gone by . " Moreover , he derided the " piles and piles and miles and miles of clips from films present and past " writing that it " squandered the visual luster " of the ceremony . Associated Press television critic Frazier Moore remarked , " Stewart , usually a very funny guy , displayed a lack of beginner 's luck as first-time host ... His usually impeccable blend of puckishness and self-effacement fell flat in the service of Oscar . " He also criticized the decision to play music over the winner 's acceptance speeches calling it " distracting and obnoxious . " The American telecast on ABC drew in an average of 38.94 million people over its length , which was an 8 % decrease from the previous year 's ceremony . Additionally , the show earned lower Nielsen ratings compared to the previous ceremony with 23.0 % of households watching over a 35 share .

		CONTEXT=Later in 1979 , Sellers starred opposite Shirley MacLaine , Melvyn Douglas and Jack Warden in the black comedy '' Being There '' as Chance , a simple-minded gardener addicted to watching TV who is regarded as a sage by the rich and powerful . In a BBC interview in 1971 , Sellers had said that more than anything else , he wanted to play the role , and successfully persuaded the author of the book , Jerzy Kosinski , to allow him and director Hal Ashby to make the film , provided Kosinski could write the script . During filming , to remain in character , Sellers refused most interview requests and kept his distance from the other actors . Sellers considered Chance 's walking and voice the character 's most important attributes , and in preparing for the role worked alone with a tape recorder or with his wife , and then with Ashby , to perfect the clear enunciation and flat delivery needed to reveal " the childlike mind behind the words " . Sellers described his experience of working on the film as " so humbling , so powerful " , and co-star Shirley MacLaine found Sellers " a dream " to work with . Sellers 's performance was universally lauded by critics and is considered by critic Danny Smith to be the " crowning triumph of Peter Sellers 's remarkable career " . Critic Frank Rich wrote that the acting skill required for this sort of role , with a " schismatic personality that Peter had to convey with strenuous vocal and gestural technique ... A lesser actor would have made the character 's mental dysfunction flamboyant and drastic ... His intelligence was always deeper , his onscreen confidence greater , his technique much more finely honed " : in achieving this , Sellers " makes the film 's fantastic premise credible " . The film earned Sellers a Best Actor award at the 51st National Board of Review Awards ; the London Critics Circle Film Awards Special Achievement Award , the Best Actor award at the 45th New York Film Critics Circle Awards ; and the Best Actor – Musical or Comedy award at the 37th Golden Globe Awards .

		CONTEXT=To be eligible for award consideration , the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences requires that a film be shown in a theater in Los Angeles County , California , for at least seven consecutive days during which it is advertised in print media . Studios hoping to position a film for some nominations usually satisfy that minimum requirement , then ease them into wide release from then until the nominations and/or awards ceremony . The flexibility this marketing strategy requires means that screens be available , and studios limit their releases of new films during this time to that end . As critic Ty Burr explained in a 2013 '' New York Times Magazine '' article on the mediocrity of new releases in the first month of the year : " T he studios ... know our attention is elsewhere . " New films shown publicly anywhere for the first time after January 1 themselves are ineligible for Oscars until the following year , by which time they will likely have been forgotten by critics , audiences and voters . '' The Silence of the Lambs '' , winner of the 1991 Academy Award for Best Picture , is a rare exception , as the only film in the post-studio era released in the first two months of its year to go on to win that Oscar . Burr calls it " the grand exception to the January Movies Will Never Amount to Anything rule , " and finds that only one other classic of the late 20th century , '' Dr. Strangelove '' , was a January release . The 2017 satirical horror film '' Get Out '' is another example of a movie released in the months of January and February that went on to be nominated for various Academy Awards such as Best Picture , eventually winning one for Best Original Screenplay

" Film critic Roger Ebert said that Stewart was " on target , topical and funny , " and added , " He was as relaxed , amusing and at home as Johnny Carson . " Columnist Ray Richmond of '' The Hollywood Reporter '' commented , " He seemed at times nervous and self-conscious , but on the whole , Stewart delivered with just the right balance of reverence and smugness . " Others media publications were more critical of the show . Television critic Rob Owen of the '' Pittsburgh Post-Gazette '' wrote that Stewart was more " amusing than funny " . He added , " Many of his jokes fell flat with the stars in the Kodak Theatre , and his tendency to bow down before celebrities quickly grew tiresome . " Tom Shales from '' The Washington Post '' commented , " It 's hard to believe that professional entertainers could have put together a show less entertaining than this year 's Oscars , hosted with a smug humorlessness by comic Jon Stewart , a sad and pale shadow of great hosts gone by . " Moreover , he derided the " piles and piles and miles and miles of clips from films present and past " writing that it " squandered the visual luster " of the ceremony . Associated Press television critic Frazier Moore remarked , " Stewart , usually a very funny guy , displayed a lack of beginner 's luck as first-time host ... His usually impeccable blend of puckishness and self-effacement fell flat in the service of Oscar . " He also criticized the decision to play music over the winner 's acceptance speeches calling it " distracting and obnoxious . " The American telecast on ABC drew in an average of 38.94 million people over its length , which was an 8 % decrease from the previous year 's ceremony . Additionally , the show earned lower Nielsen ratings compared to the previous ceremony with 23.0 % of households watching over a 35 share . Furthermore , it garnered a lower 1849 demo rating with a 13.9 rating among viewers in that demographic

" He dismissed any Israeli military threat to Iran 's nuclear program , declaring , " The Zionist regime is nothing and even its ( Western ) masters are too small to conduct any kind of aggression against Iran and the rights of the Iranian people . " Ahmadinejad also proclaimed new peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians as " stillborn and doomed . " The tens of thousands of Iranians participating in the rallies continued the regular chants of " Death to America ! Death to Israel ! " The day before the rallies , Ayatollah Khamenei tweeted , " Israel Is A Hideous Entity In the Middle East Which Will Undoubtedly Be Annihilated . " In Lebanon , the day after the resumption of direct peace negotiations between Israel and Palestine , Hassan Nasrallah , Hezbollah secretary-general , declared that : Our nation can not ignore and forget this cause ( al-Quds ) because it is part of our religion , our religious commitment , our culture , our civilization , our morals and values and our past history . ... No one has the right to give up one span of its land , one grain of its sacred sand , one drop of its water , or one letter of its name . Al Quds Day is the day for announcing this ideological , legal , historic true constant position . On this day we make the announcement that neither al-Quds nor even one of its streets nor even a neighbourhood of its neighbourhoods – and not only all of al-Quds - may be an eternal capital for the so called state of Israel .

A tentative date of December 25 , 2009 was announced , but the film was not completed in time . Organisers of the Cannes Film Festival made negotiations to secure a premiere at Cannes 2010 , resulting in Malick sending an early version of the film to Thierry Fremaux and the Cannes selection committee . Though Fremaux warmly received the cut and was eager to screen the film at his festival , Malick ultimately told him that he felt the film was not ready . On the eve of the 2010 Cannes Film Festival , Berney suddenly announced his departure from Apparition , leaving the company 's future uncertain . Pohlad decided to keep '' The Tree of Life '' at Apparition , and after significant restructuring , hired Tom Ortenberg to act as a consultant on its release . A tentative plan was made to release it in late 2010 , in time for awards consideration . Ultimately , Pohlad decided to close Apparition and sell rights to the film . Private screenings of the film to interested parties Fox Searchlight Pictures and Sony Pictures Classics took place at the 2010 Telluride Film Festival . On September 9 , Fox Searchlight announced their acquisition of the film from Pohlad 's River Road Entertainment . The film opened in limited release in the United States on May 27 , 2011
